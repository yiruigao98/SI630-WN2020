After taking care of some business matters, a man picks up a novel he had started reading a few days earlier. He sits in a green armchair with his back to the door. He likes the feeling of giving himself over to the story while simultaneously enjoying the presence of his cigarettes, his armchair, and the view of the park from his window. He sinks into the novel, in which a man and woman meet in a cabin. The woman kisses the man’s face where a tree branch has scratched it, making it bleed. The man and woman are lovers, but their attention is now focused on murder: the man is going to kill the woman’s husband. They leave the cabin and split up. The woman goes north, and he goes to her house. Following her instructions, knife in hand, the man goes inside and sees his victim: a man who’s sitting in an armchair reading a book.
