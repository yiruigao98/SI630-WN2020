and the narrator responds to the life-threatening turn of events. <div class="bookquote">``Ligeia''  (<font color='red'><b>the narrator</b></font>)</div>describes the two marriages of the narrator,
the first to the darkly featured and brilliant Lady Ligeia; the
second to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) racial opposite, the fair and blonde Lady Rowena.
Both women die quickly and mysteriously after their marriage ceremonies,
and the narrator's persistent memories of Ligeia bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Rowena</b></font>) back
to life to replace Lady Rowena's corpse. A woman also returns from the dead in <div class="bookquote">``The Fall of the
House of Usher.''  (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div>The story's narrator is summoned by his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) boyhood
friend Roderick Usher to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) during a period of emotional
distress. The narrator discovers that Roderick's twin sister, Madeline,
is also sick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Madeline</b></font>) takes a turn for the worse shortly after the narrator's arrival,
and the men bury Madeline in a tomb within the house. They later
discover, to their horror, that they have entombed her (<font color='blue'><b>Madeline</b></font>) alive. Madeline
claws her (<font color='blue'><b>Madeline</b></font>) way out, collapsing eventually on Roderick, who dies in
fear. Poe again takes up the theme of the twin in <div class="bookquote">``William Wilson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the twin</b></font>)</div>The narrator discovers that a classmate shares not only the name
William Wilson but also his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) physical build, style of dress, and
even vocal intonation. A fear of losing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) identity drives the
narrator to murder his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) rival, but the crime also mysteriously brings
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) own death. In this detective story, Poe introduces the brilliant
sleuth C. Auguste Dupin. When the Paris police arbitrarily arrest
Dupin's friend for the gruesome murders of a mother and daughter,
Dupin begins an independent investigation and solves the case accurately.
Uncovering evidence that goes otherwise unnoticed, Dupin concludes
that a wild animal, an Ourang--Outang, committed the murders. Obsessed with the vulture-like eye of an old man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) otherwise
loves and trusts, the narrator smothers the old man, dismembers
his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) body, and conceals the parts under the floorboards of the bedroom.
When the police arrive to investigate reports of the old man's shrieks,
the narrator attempts to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) cool, but hears what he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) thinks
is the beating of the old man's heart. Panicking, afraid that the
police know his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) secret, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) rips up the floorboards and confesses
his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) crime. Captured by the Inquisition, the narrator fends off hungry
rats, avoids falling into a giant pit, and escapes the razor-sharp
blades of a descending pendulum. As the walls of his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) cell are about
to close in and drive him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) into the pit, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) is saved by the French
army. When the narrator hangs a cat he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) had formerly adored,
the cat returns from the dead to haunt him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>). The narrator tries to
strike back at the cat but kills his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife in the process. The cat
draws the police to the cellar wall where the narrator has hidden
his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife's corpse. In this sequel to <div class="bookquote">``The Murders in the Rue Morgue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dupin</b></font>)</div>Dupin
recovers a stolen letter to foil a villain's plan. The police attempt
thorough investigations but come up with nothing. Identifying with
the criminal mind, Dupin discovers evidence so obvious that it had
gone unnoticed. A bloody disease called the Red Death ravages a kingdom.
Prince Prospero retreats to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prospero</b></font>) castle and throws a lavish masquerade
ball to celebrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Prospero</b></font>) escape from death. At midnight, a mysterious
guest arrives and, as the embodiment of the Red Death, kills Prospero
and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Prospero</b></font>) guests. The vengeful Montresor repays the supposed insults of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prospero</b></font>) enemy, Fortunato. Luring Fortunato into the crypts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prospero</b></font>) home
with the promise of Amontillado sherry, Montresor entombs Fortunato
in a wall while the carnival rages above them.
