Naomi Nakane, a thirty-six-year-old
middle school teacher, recalls visiting a coulee, or ravine, in
Granton, Alberta, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) uncle Isamu, her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) father's half-brother,
who she (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) simply calls Uncle. They made the trip annually, beginning
in 1954. The school year begins. Cecil, Alberta,
where Naomi teaches, is a claustrophobically small town. Its inhabitants,
predominantly white Canadians, are fascinated and a little mystified
by Naomi. One day during class, she (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) gets word that Uncle has died.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) goes to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) widow, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) calls Obasan -LRB-aunt in
Japanese-RRB-. A loaf of Uncle's infamously inedible homemade bread
sits on the counter. The two women go to the attic, where Obasan
searches for something. Naomi thinks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) own mother's unexplained
disappearance some thirty years earlier. Naomi and Obasan go to bed. Naomi dreams of two couples. One
of the men is a British officer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) wakes to find that a package from
Aunt Emily, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) mother's sister, has arrived. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) reflects on Aunt
Emily's energetic crusades against racism, and for the remembrance
and documentation of what happened to Japanese Canadians during
World War II. Naomi begins thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) childhood, beginning
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) family's beloved house in Vancouver, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) favorite tale
of Momotaro, a boy who emerged from a peach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) remembers releasing
chicks into a cage with a hen that pecked many of the chicks to
death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) remembers Old Man Gower, who repeatedly molested her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>)
beginning when she (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) was four years old. Naomi continues to think back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) past. In 1941,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) mother went to Japan to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) own mother, who was ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>)
never returned. Stephen, Naomi's older brother, began to have trouble
at school when other kids called him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Jap.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Grandma and Grandpa Nakane,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) father's parents, were imprisoned in Hastings Park, a holding
area. Interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) memories, Naomi realizes that Stephen and
Aunt Emily are on their way to the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) looks at one of the items in Aunt Emily's package:
a book of letters Emily wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) sister, Naomi's mother. The
letters chronicle the rapid deterioration of conditions for Japanese
Canadians following the declaration of war. Their possessions were
confiscated, and they were rounded up and sent to labor camps. Some families
moved to ghost towns to escape persecution. During that time, Obasan
took Naomi and Stephen to Slocan, an abandoned mining town, where
they lived in a hut in the middle of the forest. For a time, they
shared their living quarters with Nomura-obasan, an elderly woman.
While in Slocan, Naomi's paternal grandmother died. Grandma Nakane
had been living in a town called New Denver after leaving an internment
camp in Vancouver. One winter day, Uncle joined them at the hut. Soon after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) arrival, Stephen, whose leg had been in a cast for months, recovered. Summer
came. One day, Naomi and her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) friend Kenji were playing by the lake
when they encountered Rough Lock Bill, a local resident, who talked
to them for a time. After he (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) left, Naomi and Kenji took a raft onto
the lake and drifted farther than they intended to go. Kenji abandoned
Naomi in order to swim back to shore himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) couldn't swim
but, afraid of drifting out too far, jumped into the water anyway.
Rough Lock saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) from drowning. Naomi woke up in the hospital,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) thought about her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) father, who she (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) knew was also in the
hospital. She (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) also thought about the racism her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) brother contended
with, and the murder of innocent animals. Germany surrendered. One night at the public baths, Naomi learned
that Stephen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) father were sick with tuberculosis -LRB-TB-RRB-. The
morning after the war ended, Father came to the cabin. Soon after,
the government ordered everyone out of Slocan. Father disappeared
again. Naomi returns to the present day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) recalls asking Aunt
Emily what had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) mother and grandmother, and failing
to get a response. She (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) remembers going with Obasan, Uncle, and Stephen to Granton
in 1945. There they did backbreaking work
on a beet farm owned by the Barkers, an ungenerous white family.
Naomi's family lived like animals in what had once been a chicken
coop. Japanese Canadians were not allowed to return home until 1949.
Naomi's father died, a fact she (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) didn't allow herself to comprehend
for some time. Stephen attended the Royal Conservatory of Music
in Toronto, and went on to become a successful pianist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) rarely
returned home, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was surly. Mr. Barker comes to Obasan's house with his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) second wife
to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) condolences for Uncle's death. After the Barkers
leave, Naomi sleeps and dreams of her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) mother. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) wakes, Aunt Emily
and Stephen arrive along with Nakayama-sensei, an Anglican minister
and old friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) reads aloud some letters from Aunt Emily's package.
They are from Grandma Kato, Naomi's mother's mother, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) husband.
They explain that Naomi's mother never wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) children to know
what really happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) in Japan. In 1945,
Mother and Grandma Kato were caught in a bombing in Nagasaki. In
that same bombing, Setsuko, Mother's cousin and a new mother herself,
was blinded and maimed. Setsuko's son survived, but disappeared
and was never found. Setsuko's baby daughter got leukemia. In her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
attempt to save the children, Grandma was separated from Mother.
A few days or weeks later, Grandma found Mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) was alive,
but horribly disfigured and plagued by maggots. Naomi addresses her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) mother, who is dead now, and says
she (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) feels her (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) presence. In the early morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Naomi</b></font>) drives to the
coulee.
