Laurel, Mississippi, arrives at the New Orleans apartment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laurel</b></font>)
sister, Stella Kowalski. Despite the fact that Blanche seems to have
fallen out of close contact with Stella, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) intends to stay at
Stella's apartment for an unspecified but likely lengthy period
of time, given the large trunk she (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) has with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>). Blanche tells Stella
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) lost Belle Reve, their ancestral home, following the death
of all their remaining relatives. She (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) also mentions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) has
been given a leave of absence from her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) teaching position because
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) bad nerves. Though Blanche does not seem to have enough money to
afford a hotel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) is disdainful of the cramped quarters of the
Kowalskis' two-room apartment and of the apartment's location in
a noisy, diverse, working-class neighborhood. Blanche's social condescension
wins her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) the instant dislike of Stella's husband, an auto-parts supply
man of Polish descent named Stanley Kowalski. It is clear that Stella
was happy to leave behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) the social pretensions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) background
in exchange for the sexual gratification she (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) gets from her (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) husband;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) even is pregnant with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) baby. Stanley immediately distrusts
Blanche to the extent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) suspects her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) of having cheated Stella
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) share of the family inheritance. In the process of defending
herself to Stanley, Blanche reveals that Belle Reve was lost due
to a foreclosed mortgage, a disclosure that signifies the dire nature
of Blanche's financial circumstances. Blanche's heavy drinking,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) attempts to conceal from her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) sister and brother-in-law,
is another sign that all is not well with Blanche. The unhappiness that accompanies the animal magnetism
of Stella and Stanley's marriage reveals itself when Stanley hosts
a drunken poker game with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) male friends at the apartment. Blanche
gets under Stanley's skin, especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) starts to win the
affections of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) close friend Mitch. After Mitch has been absent for
a while, speaking with Blanche in the bedroom, Stanley erupts, storms
into the bedroom, and throws the radio out of the window. When Stella
yells at Stanley and defends Blanche, Stanley beats her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>). The men
pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) off, the poker game breaks up, and Blanche and Stella escape
to their upstairs neighbor Eunice's apartment. A short while later,
Stanley is remorseful and cries up to Stella to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>). To
Blanche's alarm, Stella returns to Stanley and embraces him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) passionately.
Mitch meets Blanche outside of the Kowalski flat and comforts her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) distress. The next day, Blanche tries to convince Stella to leave
Stanley for a better man whose social status equals Stella's. Blanche
suggests that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) and Stella contact a millionaire named Shep Huntleigh
for help escaping from New Orleans; when Stella laughs at her (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>), Blanche reveals
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) is completely broke. Stanley walks in as Blanche is making
fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) and secretly overhears Blanche and Stella's conversation.
Later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) threatens Blanche with hints that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) has heard rumors
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) disreputable past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) is visibly dismayed. While Blanche is alone in the apartment one evening,
waiting for Mitch to pick her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) up for a date, a teenage boy comes
by to collect money for the newspaper. Blanche doesn't have any
money for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) hits on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and gives him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a lustful kiss.
Soon after the boy departs, Mitch arrives, and they go on their
date. When Blanche returns, she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) is exhausted and clearly has been
uneasy for the entire night about the rumors Stanley mentioned earlier.
In a surprisingly sincere heart-to-heart discussion with Mitch,
Blanche reveals the greatest tragedy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) past. Years ago, her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
young husband committed suicide after she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) discovered and chastised
him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) homosexuality. Mitch describes his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) own loss of a former
love, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) tells Blanche that they need each other. When the next scene begins, about one month has passed.
It is the afternoon of Blanche's birthday. Stella is preparing a
dinner for Blanche, Mitch, Stanley, and herself, when Stanley comes
in to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) has learned news of Blanche's sordid past.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) says that after losing the DuBois mansion, Blanche moved into
a fleabag motel from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) was eventually evicted because of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) numerous sexual liaisons. Also, she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) was fired from her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) job as
a schoolteacher because the principal discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) was having
an affair with a teenage student. Stella is horrified to learn that
Stanley has told Mitch these stories about Blanche. The birthday dinner comes and goes, but Mitch never arrives. Stanley
indicates to Blanche that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) is aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) past. For a birthday
present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) a one-way bus ticket back to Laurel. Stanley's
cruelty so disturbs Stella that it appears the Kowalski household
is about to break up, but the onset of Stella's labor prevents the
imminent fight. Several hours later, Blanche, drunk, sits alone in the
apartment. Mitch, also drunk, arrives and repeats all he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>)'s learned
from Stanley. Eventually Blanche confesses that the stories are
true, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) also reveals the need for human affection she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) felt
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) husband's death. Mitch tells Blanche that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) can never
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>), saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) isn't fit to live in the same house as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>)
mother. Having learned that Blanche is not the chaste lady she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) pretended
to be, Mitch tries to have sex with Blanche, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) forces him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>)
to leave by yelling <div class="bookquote">``Fire!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to attract the attention of passersby
outside. Later, Stanley returns from the hospital to find Blanche
even more drunk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) will soon be leaving New
Orleans with her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) former suitor Shep Huntleigh, who is now a millionaire. Stanley
knows that Blanche's story is entirely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) imagination, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>)
is so happy about his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) baby that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) proposes they each celebrate
their good fortune. Blanche spurns Stanley, and things grow contentious.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) tries to step past him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) refuses to move out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) way.
Blanche becomes terrified to the point that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) smashes a bottle
on the table and threatens to smash Stanley in the face. Stanley
grabs her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) arm and says that it's time for the <div class="bookquote">``date''  (<font color='red'><b>Stanley</b></font>)</div>they've had set
up since Blanche's arrival. Blanche resists, but Stanley uses his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) physical
strength to overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) carries her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) to bed. The pulsing
music indicates that Stanley rapes Blanche. The next scene takes place weeks later, as Stella and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) neighbor Eunice pack Blanche's bags. Blanche is in the bath,
and Stanley plays poker with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) buddies in the front room. A doctor
will arrive soon to take Blanche to an insane asylum, but Blanche
believes she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) is leaving to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) millionaire. Stella confesses
to Eunice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) simply cannot allow herself to believe Blanche's
assertion that Stanley raped her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>). When Blanche emerges from the
bathroom, her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) deluded talk makes it clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
grip on reality. The doctor arrives with a nurse, and Blanche initially
panics and struggles against them when they try to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) away.
Stanley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) friends fight to subdue Blanche, while Eunice holds
Stella back to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) from interfering. Mitch begins to cry. Finally,
the doctor approaches Blanche in a gentle manner and convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
to leave with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) allows him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) away and does not
look back or say goodbye as she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) goes. Stella sobs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) child
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) arms, and Stanley comforts her (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>) with loving words and caresses.
