The Doctor returns home and discovers that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeremiah</b></font>) pet parrot has escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeremiah</b></font>) cage to the top of the mango tree outside. Dr. Urbino climbs a ladder to the branch on which the parrot sits, but just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jeremiah</b></font>) grasps the parrot, the Doctor falls to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) death. Flo rentino Ariza professes, for a second time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``eternal fidelity and everlasting love''  (<font color='red'><b>Flo</b></font>)</div>to the Doctor and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wife, Fermina Daza. Fermina is horrified by such an insensitive display, and, for the first time, realizes the magnitude of the <div class="bookquote">``drama''  (<font color='red'><b>Fermina/Fermina Daza</b></font>)</div>sh e had provoked at the age of eighteen. Although Fermina Daza may have erased Florentino Ariza from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) memory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) has not stopped thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) since their long, troubled love affair ended fifty-one years, nine months, and four days ago. Florentino first meets Fermina when he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) delivers a tele gram to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, Lorenzo Daza, who is notorious for his (<font color='blue'><b>Daza</b></font>) shady dealings. After watching Fermina, always accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Aunt Escolástica, walk to school each day from the Park of the Evangels, Florentino works up the courage to approach her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) o ne day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) asks that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) accept a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) refuses because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is obligated to get her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's permission. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) demands that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does the following week. Florentino decides to give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a subdued note -LRB-instead of the sixt y-page letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) had originally written-RRB- in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) resolutely declares his (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) is in agony as he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) awaits her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reply, but is overjoyed when Fermina finally answers approvingly. In the two years that follow, Fermina and Florentino see one another only in passing, though they write love letters daily. Florentino proposes marriage to Fermina, and again her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reply is favorable. Fermina is caught writing a love letter by the Mother Su perior at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) academy and is expelled. Lorenzo finds love letters in Fermina's room and as punishment, banishes Escolástica and forces Fermina to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) on a long journey, not to end until she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has forgotten about Florentino. On the journey, Fermina meets and befriends her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) older cousin, Hildebranda Sánchez, who helps Florentino and Fermina communicate via telegraph messages. Florentino hardly recognizes Fermina upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) return from the long journey, because, now seventeen, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has matured into a woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in the Arcade of the Scribes, and approaches her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). When Fermina sees him (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is suddenly disgusted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) and w ith herself for ever having been foolish enough to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>). Coolly, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tells Florentino to <div class="bookquote">``forget it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Florentino</b></font>)</div>Florentino tries once more to woo Fermina, but to no avail. In the fifty-one years, nine months, and four days that follow, not once does Florentino have the chance to speak or see his (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) beloved Fermina in private. Initially, he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) vows to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) virginity for only Fermina, but after being seized by Rosalba aboard a ship to a faraway city, he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) turns to sex to ameliorate the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) feels at having lo st Fermina. He (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) returns home, intent upon once again making her (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) own. Meanwhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) conducts affairs, however secret, with innumerable women, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) is rumored to be a homosexual. Dr. Urbino courts Fermina, who resists his (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) affections. Lorenzo Daza forces the Doctor upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Daza</b></font>) daughter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) reluctantly concedes. When Florentino hears that Fermina is to marry a prestigious physician, he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) vows to make himself worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) uncle , Don Leo XII Loayza, gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) a job at the River Company of the Caribbean, of which, after thirty years, Florentino becomes President. Fermina and the Doctor honeymoon in Europe for three months. When Fermina returns, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is pregnant with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) first child. Despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) determination to win Fermina, Florentino continues his (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) lustful affairs with other women, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) finds at the transient hotel and on the trolley. It is on the trolley that he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) meets Leona Cassiani, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) mistakes for a whore. Leona asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) only for a job, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) gives to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leona</b></font>). Florentino realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) must wait, without violence or impatience, for Dr. Urbino to die before he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) can win over Fermina. When in public, he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) is greeted by Dr. Urbino with familiar cordiality, though Fermina lends only a courteous glance or smile, and w ithout memory of their past. Fermina and the Doctor appear to be a very happy couple, but in reality they are quite dissatisfied. The unhappy but stable marriage is rocked when Dr. Urbino conducts a four-month affair with Barbara Lynch, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) ends it when Fermina confronts him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) knowledge of it. Infuriated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) husband's infidelity, Fermina goes to live with Hildebranda on her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) ranch. The Doctor arrives at the ranch unannounced to take Fermina, who is overjoyed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) arrival, home with hi m. Upon the Doctor's accidental death, Florentino, now elderly, abruptly ends his (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) affair with fourteen-year-old América Vicuña and, at Dr. Urbino's wake, professes his (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``eternal fidelity and everlasting love''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Urbino</b></font>)</div>to Fermina. After having banished him (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) home in anger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) a hateful letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) responds with a meditation on life and love, which helps her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) grief. Gradually, after a letter correspondence, they rekindle their relationship and spend afternoons together in Fermina's ho me. Florentino asks Fermina to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) on a river voyage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) accepts. On the voyage, Florentino and Fermina finally make love. As the ship reaches its last port, Fermina sees people she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) knows and frets that if they see her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) with Florentino, it w ill cause scandal. Florentino orders the Captain to raise the yellow flag of cholera, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) does. There remain no passengers on aboard but Fermina, Florentino, the Captain, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Florentino</b></font>) lover. No port will allow them to dock because of the supposed cholera outbreak aboard, and they are forever exiled to cruise the river.
