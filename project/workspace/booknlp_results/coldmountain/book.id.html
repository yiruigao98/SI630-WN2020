with its protagonist, Inman, lying in a Virginia hospital recovering
from war wounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) is shattered by the violence he (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) has witnessed
while fighting in the Confederate army and wants to go home to reunite
with Ada, the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) loves. Inman talks to a blind man and realizes
that losing something you already have is worse than not getting
what you want. One day in town, Inman writes to inform Ada that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) is returning home. That night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) leaves the hospital through
a window and sets out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) journey back to North Carolina. The story of Inman's adventures intertwines with Ada's
story. Ada is left alone to manage Black Cove Farm following her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
father's death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) is bereft and has no idea where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) belongs
or how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) should earn a living. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) visits the Swangers, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>)
neighbors, Ada looks into a well to foretell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) future. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) sees
a man walking through the woods on a journey but does not know what
this vision means. The next day, Sally Swanger sends a local girl
named Ruby to help out on the farm. Ruby and Ada become friends
and establish a comfortable domestic routine. Meanwhile, Inman's journey westward is fraught with danger and
violence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) is pursued across the Cape Fear River, escaping with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) life thanks to the skill of a girl paddling a dugout canoe. Inman
intervenes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) finds a dissolute preacher, Solomon Veasey, attempting
to murder his (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) -LRB-the preacher's-RRB- pregnant lover. The preacher is exiled
from his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) community, and Inman is forced to -continue part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>)
journey with Veasey. Inman has to intervene again when Veasey causes
trouble in a store and at an inn. While Veasey spends the night
with a prostitute called Big Tildy, the peddler Odell tells Inman
a sad story about landowners' cruelty towards slaves. The next day, Inman and Veasey help a man remove a dead
bull from his (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) stream. This man, Junior, invites them to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home
to spend the night, and several strange things happen. Inman is
drugged and forced to marry Junior's wife, who the author suggests
may be a cannibal. Junior then hands Inman and Veasey over to the
Home Guard, the military force that has been searching for Inman.
Inman is forced to walk eastward, retracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) steps. The guards
decide to shoot the men and bury them in a shallow grave. Although
Inman escapes with a slight head wound, Veasey dies. Ada's story resumes. The novel follows her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) adjustment
to a life of labor in harmony with nature. Ada's friendship with
Ruby blossoms as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) begins to identify with the natural world.
The female protagonist lays down roots at the farm and recalls memories
of Inman and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) father. Occasionally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) finds herself touched
by events surrounding the war. A group of pilgrims forced into exile
by Federal soldiers seeks shelter for a day at the farm. Ada recalls
Blount, a soldier she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) met at a party in Charleston who later died
in battle. Finally, when Ada and Ruby visit the town of Cold Mountain, they
hear a story told by a prisoner jailed for desertion. The captive tells
of the sadistic Teague's band of the Home Guard. On their walk home,
the two women observe some herons, and Ruby explains that a heron
fathered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>). Ada tells the intricate story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) parents' relationship
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) mother's tragic death in childbirth. Ruby's father, Stobrod,
appears later, caught in a trap the women have laid to catch a corn
thief. He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) explains that he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) is living in a mountain cave with a community
of outliers who object to the war. Stobrod plays his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) fiddle to prove
that he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) is a changed man, but Ruby remains skeptical. Inman's story continues. Having been dragged from the
shallow grave by wild hogs, Inman meets a kind slave who feeds and
clothes him (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) and draws a map of what lies ahead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) returns to Junior's house
and kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>). Inman then continues on his (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) journey, full of despair,
a <div class="bookquote">``traveling shade.''  (<font color='red'><b>Inman</b></font>)</div>Inman meets an old woman who offers him (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) shelter
at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) camp in the mountains. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) rests and regains his (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) strength
while the woman nurses his (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) wounds and talks about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life. Inman
learns that the woman ran away from a loveless marriage and raises
goats for company and sustenance. Inman identifies with the goat-woman,
but concludes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) could not live such an isolated life. Inman continues to wander and meets a man called <div class="bookquote">``Potts,''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>who directs him (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) to a cabin belonging to Sara, a kind young woman whose
husband died in battle. Sara feeds Inman, mends his (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) clothes and
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) story. Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) bravery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is close to despair. The
next day, Inman kills three Federal soldiers, called <div class="bookquote">``Federals''
 (<font color='red'><b>Federal soldiers</b></font>)</div>in the novel,  after these men threaten Sara and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) baby and steal
the family hog, the only form of sustenance that the family has. At home, Ada and Ruby start harvesting apples as autumn
nears. Stobrod reappears with a slow-witted banjo player named Pangle. Ruby's
father asks for shelter at the farm and for food provisions, explaining
that the men intend to leave the outliers' cave because it is getting
too dangerous. To Ruby's annoyance, Ada agrees to help Stobrod.
The men go off into the mountains with a boy from Georgia to find
their own camp. Teague's Home Guard appears looking for the mountain
cave and shoots Stobrod and Pangle. The Georgia boy, who survived
because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hid in a thicket, runs to the farm and tells the women
what happened. Ada and Ruby leave to bury the bodies and camp out
in the mountains. The next day, they bury Pangle but discover that
Stobrod is still alive. Ruby removes the bullet from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) father
and takes him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to an abandoned Cherokee village. Meanwhile, Inman reaches Black Cove Farm and finds himself
in sight of Cold Mountain. The Georgia boy tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) that the women have
left to bury Ruby's father. Inman climbs the mountain and finds
Pangle's grave but loses Ada's tracks in the snow. The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>)
hears a gunshot and finds Ada hunting turkeys. The lovers spend four
days together at the Cherokee village, discussing their feelings, past
experiences, and plans for the future. They decide that Inman will
walk north and surrender to the Federals, since the war will be over
soon. On the fifth day, Stobrod is strong enough to travel. Ada and
Ruby leave for the farm and the men follow. On the journey back to Black Cove, the Home Guard ambushes Inman
and Stobrod. Inman kills all the men except for Birch, Teague's
second-in-command. Birch seems powerless and scared, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Birch</b></font>) shoots
Inman before the Inman can attack him (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>). Ada hears the shots, finds
Stobrod, and races back to locate Inman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) holds him (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) lap
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Inman</b></font>) dies. In a brief epilogue set ten years later, Ada, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) nine
year-old daughter -LRB-presumably by Inman-RRB-, and Ruby's family gather
in the evening. Ruby has married the boy from Georgia, called Reid,
and has had three sons with him (<font color='blue'><b>Reid</b></font>). The family sits down to eat. When
the meal is over, Stobrod plays his (<font color='blue'><b>Reid</b></font>) fiddle and Ada reads to the
children.
