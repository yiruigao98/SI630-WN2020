As a young boy, Stephen's Catholic faith and Irish nationality heavily influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) attends a strict religious boarding school called Clongowes Wood College. At first, Stephen is lonely and homesick at the school, but as time passes he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) place among the other boys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) enjoys his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) visits home, even though family tensions run high after the death of the Irish political leader Charles Stewart Parnell. This sensitive subject becomes the topic of a furious, politically charged argument over the family's Christmas dinner. Stephen's father, Simon, is inept with money, and the family sinks deeper and deeper into debt. After a summer spent in the company of his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) Uncle Charles, Stephen learns that the family cannot afford to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) back to Clongowes, and that they will instead move to Dublin. Stephen starts attending a prestigious day school called Belvedere, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) grows to excel as a writer and as an actor in the student theater. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) first sexual experience, with a young Dublin prostitute, unleashes a storm of guilt and shame in Stephen, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) tries to reconcile his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) physical desires with the stern Catholic morality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) surroundings. For a while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) ignores his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) religious upbringing, throwing himself with debauched abandon into a variety of sins--masturbation, gluttony, and more visits to prostitutes, among others. Then, on a three-day religious retreat, Stephen hears a trio of fiery sermons about sin, judgment, and hell. Deeply shaken, the young man resolves to rededicate himself to a life of Christian piety. Stephen begins attending Mass every day, becoming a model of Catholic piety, abstinence, and self-denial. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) religious devotion is so pronounced that the director of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) school asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) to consider entering the priesthood. After briefly considering the offer, Stephen realizes that the austerity of the priestly life is utterly incompatible with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) love for sensual beauty. That day, Stephen learns from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) sister that the family will be moving, once again for financial reasons. Anxiously awaiting news about his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) acceptance to the university, Stephen goes for a walk on the beach, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) observes a young girl wading in the tide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) is struck by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beauty, and realizes, in a moment of epiphany, that the love and desire of beauty should not be a source of shame. Stephen resolves to live his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) life to the fullest, and vows not to be constrained by the boundaries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) family, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) nation, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) religion. Stephen moves on to the university, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) develops a number of strong friendships, and is especially close with a young man named Cranly. In a series of conversations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) companions, Stephen works to formulate his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) theories about art. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) is dependent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) friends as listeners, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) is also determined to create an independent existence, liberated from the expectations of friends and family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) becomes more and more determined to free himself from all limiting pressures, and eventually decides to leave Ireland to escape them. Like his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) namesake, the mythical Daedalus, Stephen hopes to build himself wings on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) can fly above all obstacles and achieve a life as an artist.
