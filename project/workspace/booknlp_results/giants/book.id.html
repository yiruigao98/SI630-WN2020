Per's family becomes lost when they separate from the other wagons, but they eventually reache their destination. They establish a small settlement along Spring Creek, and everyone starts building sod-houses. A man of action, Per thrives in the work of building a home for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family on the prairie. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreams of the day when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be wealthy and own a lot of land. However, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sensitive wife, Beret, does not adapt very well to life on the desolate prairie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) begins to feel homesick for Norway. The settlers meet many threats on the prairie, but they persist, striving to build a new life. Per encounters a band of Indians, but they prove to be friendly. Next, the settlement's cows disappear, but Per manages to find them. Per meets his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) greatest challenge when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discovers stakes that earlier settlers placed in the land to claim it--but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) removes them. When the Irish settlers return to reclaim their holdings, they can find no trace of their markers. Though Per has saved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbors' land, Beret discovers to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horror that Per has committed the crime of removing another man's landmarks. Beret feels uncivilized living in the wilderness-- she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants to return to Norway. Whenever Per leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to go to town for supplies, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels lonely. Per attempts so brighten things up, surprising everyone by whitewashing the interior of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beret</b></font>) sod house. However, nothing can cheer Beret up as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gradually sinks into depression. As Beret approaches childbirth, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) becomes increasingly difficult. Per hopes that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will return to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) normal self when she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) baby. As winter falls, however, Beret grows more and more desolate. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begins to think about her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) past in Norway and about all of the sins she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has committed. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also remembers how she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first fell in love with Per. Beret regrets defying her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) parents' wishes by moving to America. On Christmas Day, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begins to go into labor, and Per fears that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will not survive. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) survives and gives birth to a son, whom Per names Peder Victorious. Per makes Hans Olsa baptize the baby. The winter proves lonesome for many of the settlers, who amuse themselves with social gatherings. Henry Solum organizes a school for the children. The settlers begin to run out of supplies, so the men of the settlement decide to make a trip to town. Per almost dies when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is caught in a storm, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) reaches safety when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) finds a house. Later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) discovers a way of making money by trading furs with the Indians. On another occasion, the immigrants decide to adopt American names. Only Beret feels that these names are sacrilegious steps away from their Norwegian fathers. More and more caravans pass through the territory. One day, a strange Norwegian couple arrives with a tragic story. The wife, Kari, is insane with grief because her (<font color='blue'><b>Kari</b></font>) son died and had to be buried in the prairie. While Beret grows more and more unhappy, Per thrives as summer passes and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) crops prosper. Per continues to be optimistic despite all the hardships they face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dreams of one day providing a better life for family. However, one day the settlers see their crops destroyed by a plague of locusts. Per's crops are saved, but his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife is missing. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) finds her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hiding in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) emigrant chest, insane with fear. For the first time, Per is helpless because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cannot make his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife better. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is horrified to see his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) beloved Beret deranged. Several years pass. As new settlers arrive, the community grows. Beret eventually becomes obsessively religious after she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) falls under the influence of a traveling minister, who baptizes Peder Victorious and then stays on in the community. Beret begins to regain her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) senses with the help of the minister and Per. Per and Beret's relationship remains distant, however. The winter of 1880--1881 proves to be especially harsh. Hans Olsa, the friend and neighbor of the Hansas, becomes severely ill. Beret feels concerned about Hans's spiritual well being, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) insists that Per fetch the minister to be with the dying man. Per and Beret have a fierce argument. Reluctant because he (<font color='blue'><b>Beret</b></font>) knows the trip is impossible in the severe weather, Per at last agrees. On the journey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beret</b></font>) is caught in a fierce blizzard and dies alone on the prairie.
