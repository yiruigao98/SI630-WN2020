in the late 1800s in Grand Isle, a summer
holiday resort popular with the wealthy inhabitants of nearby New
Orleans. Edna Pontellier is vacationing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) husband, Léonce,
and their two sons at the cottages of Madame Lebrun, which house
affluent Creoles from the French Quarter. Léonce is kind and loving
but preoccupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebrun</b></font>) work. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lebrun</b></font>) frequent business-related absences
mar his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebrun</b></font>) domestic life with Edna. Consequently, Edna spends most
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) friend Adèle Ratignolle, a married Creole who
epitomizes womanly elegance and charm. Through her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) relationship
with Adèle, Edna learns a great deal about freedom of expression. Because
Creole women were expected and assumed to be chaste, they could
behave in a forthright and unreserved manner. Exposure to such openness
liberates Edna from her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) previously prudish behavior and repressed
emotions and desires. Edna's relationship with Adèle begins Edna's process of
<div class="bookquote">``awakening''  (<font color='red'><b>Edna</b></font>)</div>and self-discovery, which constitutes the focus of the
book. The process accelerates as Edna comes to know Robert Lebrun,
the elder, single son of Madame Lebrun. Robert is known among the Grand
Isle vacationers as a man who chooses one woman each year--often
a married woman--to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) then plays <div class="bookquote">``attendant''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>all summer long.
This summer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) devotes himself to Edna, and the two spend their
days together lounging and talking by the shore. Adèle Ratignolle
often accompanies them. At first, the relationship between Robert and Edna is
innocent. They mostly bathe in the sea or engage in idle talk. As
the summer progresses, however, Edna and Robert grow closer, and
Robert's affections and attention inspire in Edna several internal
revelations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) feels more alive than ever before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) starts
to paint again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) did in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) youth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) also learns to swim
and becomes aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) independence and sexuality. Edna and Robert
never openly discuss their love for one another, but the time they
spend alone together kindles memories in Edna of the dreams and
desires of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) youth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) becomes inexplicably depressed at night
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) husband and profoundly joyful during her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) moments of freedom, whether
alone or with Robert. Recognizing how intense the relationship between
him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) and Edna has become, Robert honorably removes himself from Grand
Isle to avoid consummating his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) forbidden love. Edna returns to New
Orleans a changed woman. Back in New Orleans, Edna actively pursues her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) painting
and ignores all of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) social responsibilities. Worried about the
changing attitude and increasing disobedience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife, Léonce
seeks the guidance of the family physician, Doctor Mandelet. A wise
and enlightened man, Doctor Mandelet suspects that Edna's transformation
is the result of an affair, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hides his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) suspicions from Léonce.
Instead, Doctor Mandelet suggests that Léonce let Edna's defiance
run its course, since attempts to control her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) would only fuel her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>)
rebellion. Léonce heeds the doctor's advice, allowing Edna to remain
home alone while he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is away on business. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) husband gone and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) children away as well, Edna wholly rejects her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) former lifestyle.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) moves into a home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) own and declares herself independent--the
possession of no one. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) love for Robert still intense, Edna pursues
an affair with the town seducer, Alcée Arobin, who is able to satisfy
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) sexual needs. Never emotionally attached to Arobin, Edna maintains
control throughout their affair, satisfying her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) animalistic urges
but retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) freedom from male domination. At this point, the self-sufficient and unconventional
old pianist Mademoiselle Reisz adopts Edna as a sort of protégé,
warning Edna of the sacrifices required of an artist. Edna is moved
by Mademoiselle Reisz's piano playing and visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) often. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>)
is also eager to read the letters from abroad that Robert sends
the woman. A woman who devotes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life entirely to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) art, Mademoiselle
serves as an inspiration and model to Edna, who continues her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) process
of awakening and independence. Mademoiselle Reisz is the only person
who knows of Robert and Edna's secret love for one another and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>)
encourages Edna to admit to, and act upon, her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) feelings. Unable to stay away, Robert returns to New Orleans, finally expressing
openly his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) feelings for Edna. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) admits his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) love but reminds her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>)
that they cannot possibly be together, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) is the wife of
another man. Edna explains to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) newly established independence,
denying the rights of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) husband over her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) and explaining how she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>)
and Robert can live together happily, ignoring everything extraneous
to their relationship. But despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) love for Edna, Robert feels
unable to enter into the adulterous affair. When Adèle undergoes a difficult and dangerous childbirth, Edna
leaves Robert's arms to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) pleads with him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to wait
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) return. From the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) spends with Edna, Adèle senses
that Edna is becoming increasingly distant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) understands
that Edna's relationship with Robert has intensified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) reminds
Edna to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) children and advocates the socially acceptable
lifestyle Edna abandoned so long ago. Doctor Mandelet, while walking
Edna home from Adèle's, urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) to come see him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is
worried about the outcome of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) passionate but confused actions.
Already reeling under the weight of Adèle's admonition, Edna begins
to perceive herself as having acted selfishly. Edna returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) house to find Robert gone,
a note of farewell left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) place. Robert's inability to escape
the ties of society now prompts Edna's most devastating awakening.
Haunted by thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) children and realizing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) would
have eventually found even Robert unable to fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) desires
and dreams, Edna feels an overwhelming sense of solitude. Alone
in a world in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) has found no feeling of belonging, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) can find
only one answer to the inescapable and heartbreaking limitations
of society. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) returns to Grand Isle, the site of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) first moments
of emotional, sexual, and intellectual awareness, and, in a final
escape, gives herself to the sea. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) swims through the soft,
embracing water, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) thinks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) freedom from her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) husband and
children, as well as Robert's failure to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>), Doctor
Mandelet's words of wisdom, and Mademoiselle Reisz's courage. The
text leaves open the question of whether the suicide constitutes
a cowardly surrender or a liberating triumph.
