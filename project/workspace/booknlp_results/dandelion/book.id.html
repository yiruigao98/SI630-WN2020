The summer starts with Douglas coming to the realization that he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) is alive, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) rejoices in the beauty of everything around him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>). The dandelion wine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) makes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) ten year old brother Tom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) grandfather represents that beauty. At the end of June, July, and August, they press one small bottle for each day of the summer. Douglas is ready to enjoy the magical life of summer, but something is missing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) needs new sneakers. Douglas does not need new sneakers because he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) wants to look good or because last years pair is out of style. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) needs new sneakers because the Royal Crown Cream-Sponge Para Litefoot Tennis Shoes have the magic that he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) needs to run like the wind and bound through the world. Douglas tells Mr. Sanderson, the shoe salesman, the importance of the sneakers to him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) passion is so great that the old man is transported briefly back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own childhood, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to run like gazelles and antelopes. The man is so thrilled by Douglas's speech that he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) a list of errands to run in exchange for the new shoes. Douglas is now ready to run through the town and its ravine, the gateway to the wilderness, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) pals Charlie Woodman and John Huff. Douglas decides that this summer he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) will record the events that occur in two different ways: he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) will write down all of the rituals that occur every summer, and write down his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) reflections on those rituals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) has already discovered that adults and children are two different races, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) lets Tom in on his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) plan to record the summer. The summer is full of events. Leo Auffmann, the town jeweler, decides to invent a Happiness Machine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) fails, but learns from his (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) failure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) family is the only Happiness Machine he (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) will ever need. Douglas is saddened that Leo could not succeed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) endeavor. Grandpa Spaulding points out the beauty of mowing the lawn to Bill Forrester, the newspaperman who is a boarder at Douglas's grandparents' house -LRB-next door to his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) house-RRB-. Along with their mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, Douglas and Tom help beat the dust and dirt out of the huge rugs from the house. Tom discovers that old people were never children, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) relays this to Douglas. Douglas is amazed by this but soon finds that old people have tremendous value. Charlie takes John and Douglas to meet Colonel Freeleigh, a very old man whom they call a Time Machine because his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) stories transport them back to an earlier time. Douglas realizes that old people may not have been children, but they have a past. Things also begin to change for Douglas. The Green Machine, the electric car driven by Miss Fern and Miss Roberta that all of the children would sometimes ride in, is put away in their garage, never to be driven again. The town trolley, driven by Mr. Tridden, runs for the final time. Buses will replace the trolley. John Huff, Douglas's best friend, informs him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) is moving away, to Milwaukee. Douglas is crushed by John's departure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) deals with the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) friend by getting very angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) for leaving. Mrs. Elmira Brown accuses Clara Goodwater of using magic to win the election every year at the Honeysuckle Ladies Lodge, and attempts to use a magic spell of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) own. This episode ends in comic disaster, and Tom relays it all to Douglas, who is enthralled with the idea of magic. Then Colonel Freeleigh passes away, and Douglas feels a great loss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) realizes that all of the colonel's stories and memories have passed away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>), and as August starts Douglas begins to get down about the summer. However, his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) grandfather is able to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) spirits with a bit of dandelion wine. Soon the image of death begins to haunt Douglas even more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) observes the brief but sweet romance between Bill Forrester and ninety-five-year-old Helen Loomis. Although their ages are poorly matched, they spend hours talking together every day for weeks, and it seems that their minds are perfect for each other. This ends when Miss Loomis dies, and Douglas is left wondering why there are no happy endings. His (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) brother Tom tries to explain that the romance was happy because it was all they could ever have, but Douglas is not satisfied. The Lonely One, an evil prowler who lurks in the night and strangles women, has the town in a state of fright. Lavinia Nebbs and Francine stumble upon the dead body of Elizabeth Ramsell on their way to the movies. Douglas sees the body and runs off. Later that night Miss Nebbs stabs and kills the Lonely One in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) house. While Tom convinces Charlie that the man killed could not have been the Lonely One because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not look like the Lonely One they imagined, Douglas is shocked by how close he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) was to death. Next his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) great-grandma dies, and although she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) tells Douglas that death is not a bad thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) begins to draw a fateful conclusion. Douglas realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) must die. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) convinces his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) brother to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) in a crazy escapade to save the wax Tarot Witch from the penny arcade where she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) tells people's fortunes. Douglas thinks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) is really Mme. Tarot, imprisoned in wax, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) frees her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) will help him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) live forever. Douglas knows that no witch can save him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) from death, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) coming to terms with the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) must die sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) into a terrible fever. No one can help Douglas except Mr. Jonas, the junkman, who gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) two bottles of pure winter air, to be tasted when the summer heat is too great. Mr. Jonas's gift breaks the fever. The summer had become too much for Douglas, but the air helps him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) see that change is a part of life and restores the magic to the summer. Douglas is able to come to terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) passes on the gift that Mr. Jonas gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) grandmother when she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) loses her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) spontaneous talent for cooking. The summer ends with Douglas once again thrilled with the magic of life.
