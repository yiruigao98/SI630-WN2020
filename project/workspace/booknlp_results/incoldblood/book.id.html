After a long drive, they pull up to the Clutter home with a shotgun and knife in hand. That morning, the bodies are discovered by Susan Kidwell and another of Nancy's friends.

Before they are caught, Dick and Perry steal a car, return to Kansas City, pass more hot checks, and take up residence in Miami.
