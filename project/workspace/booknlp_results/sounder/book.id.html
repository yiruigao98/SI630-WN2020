The father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dog, Sounder, go hunting each night, but the hunting is poor. The family subsists on biscuits and gravy until one morning they wake up to the smell of boiling ham. They eat it, but a while later a sheriff and two of his (<font color='blue'><b>sheriff</b></font>) deputies burst into the cabin and arrest the father, saying that they have proof he (<font color='blue'><b>sheriff</b></font>) stole the ham. Sounder runs after them, and one of the deputies shoots him (<font color='blue'><b>sheriff</b></font>). The boy goes looking for Sounder but cannot find him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) anywhere. When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) traces their steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) finds blood on the ground along with Sounder's ear. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) puts the ear under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pillow and wishes for Sounder's return. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother thinks Sounder has gone off to die on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own, but for several weeks the boy goes in search of the dog each day. In father's absence, the family survives on the money mother makes by shelling walnuts. The boy undertakes the added responsibility of helping to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) siblings, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is stricken by the intense loneliness in the cabin. Around Christmastime, the boy's mother makes a four-layer cake for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to bring to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father in jail. On the way there, the boy is nervous about being stopped and made fun of by the townspeople. When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arrives at the jail, the jail guard treats him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) rudely, making him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) wait to enter for a number of hours. Finally, the boy is let into the jail, and the guard breaks the cake into pieces. The boy gives it to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father anyway and tells his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father that Sounder might not be dead. The conversation between the boy and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father is strained and awkward, and at the end of it his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father tells him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) not to come back to the jail anymore. The next morning the boy wakes up to the sound of faint whining and goes outside to find Sounder standing there. The dog can only use three of its legs and only has one ear and one eye. The boy and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother tend to the dog, gradually getting used to the way Sounder looks. Soon they receive word that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father was convicted and sentenced to hard labor, traveling county to county. The boy resolves to search for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, and, for a period of months, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) journeys around the county looking for convicts working. One day the boy spots a group of convicts working, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) leans up against a fence to watch them, looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father. The guard watching the group whacks the boy on the fingers with a piece of iron and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to leave. The boy runs to a school where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tries to wash the blood of off his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) finds an old book in a trashcan and carries it with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). While he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is at the cistern, school lets out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eventually meets an old teacher who takes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in, dresses his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wounds, and asks what has happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). The boy tells the teacher about Sounder and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, and the teacher extends an offer for the boy to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and learn to read. The boy's mother tells him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to go, and the boy stays with the teacher during the fall and winter, working in the fields during the summer. One fall the boy is at home helping with chores when they see his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father walking back toward them. Half of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's body is damaged from a dynamite blast, but the man has made it home. The man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dog are reunited and leave one night to go hunting. Sounder later comes back without his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master, and, when the boy goes looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) finds him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dead. Soon after, Sounder climbs under the porch and dies as well. Despite their deaths, there is a sense of peace and resolution over the family--especially over the boy, who has achieved the single thing he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) most wanted in the world, which is achieving his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) literacy.
