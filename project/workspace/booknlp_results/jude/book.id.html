He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) is inspired by the ambitions of the town schoolmaster, Richard Phillotson, who left for Christminster when Jude was a child. However, Jude falls in love with a young woman named Arabella, is tricked into marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and cannot leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) home village. When their marriage goes sour and Arabella moves to Australia, Jude resolves to go to Christminster at last. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) finds that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) attempts to enroll at the university are met with little enthusiasm. Jude meets his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cousin Sue Bridehead and tries not to fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arranges for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to work with Phillotson in order to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) in Christminster, but is disappointed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) discovers that the two are engaged to be married. Once they marry, Jude is not surprised to find that Sue is not happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) can no longer tolerate the relationship and leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) husband to live with Jude. Both Jude and Sue get divorced, but Sue does not want to remarry. Arabella reveals to Jude that they have a son in Australia, and Jude asks to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in. Sue and Jude serve as parents to the little boy and have two children of their own. Jude falls ill, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) recovers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) decides to return to Christminster with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) family. They have trouble finding lodging because they are not married, and Jude stays in an inn separate from Sue and the children. At night Sue takes Jude's son out to look for a room, and the little boy decides that they would be better off without so many children. In the morning, Sue goes to Jude's room and eats breakfast with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). They return to the lodging house to find that Jude's son has hanged the other two children and himself. Feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) has been punished by God for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) relationship with Jude, Sue goes back to live with Phillotson, and Jude is tricked into living with Arabella again. Jude dies soon after.
