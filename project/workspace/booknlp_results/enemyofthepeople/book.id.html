Dr. Stockmann has just discovered that the baths' drainage system is seriously contaminated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stockmann</b></font>) alerts several members of the community, including Hovstad and Aslaksen, and receives generous support and thanks for making his (<font color='blue'><b>Stockmann</b></font>) discovery in time to save the town. The next morning, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stockmann</b></font>) brother, who is also the town's mayor, tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Stockmann</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stockmann</b></font>) must retract his (<font color='blue'><b>Stockmann</b></font>) statements, for the necessary repairs would be too expensive; additionally, the mayor is not convinced by Dr. Stockmann's findings. The brothers have a fierce argument, but Dr. Stockmann hopes that at least Hovstad's newspaper will support him (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>). However, the mayor convinces Hovstad and Aslaksen to oppose Dr. Stockmann. The doctor holds a town meeting to give a lecture on the baths, but Aslaksen and the mayor try to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) from speaking. Dr. Stockmann then begins a long tirade in which he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) condemns the foundations of the town and the tyranny of the majority. The audience finds his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) speech incredibly offensive, and the next morning the doctor's home is vandalized. He (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) daughter are fired. The mayor insinuates that the doctor's actions were merely a scheme to inherit more of Morten Kiil's money, and Kiil himself soon arrives to suggest just such a plan to Dr. Stockmann. However, the doctor refuses all such suggestions and decides to defy authority and remain in town. His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) family is supportive, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) says that the strongest man is the man who stands alone.
