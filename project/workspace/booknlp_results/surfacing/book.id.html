her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) missing father. She (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) brings her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) boyfriend, Joe, and a married couple, Anna and
David. On the way to a village near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's island, the narrator visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father's friend Paul. Paul can provide no new information on how to locate the
narrator's father. A guide named Evans takes the narrator and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) companions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father's island, where the narrator searches for clues regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's
disappearance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) becomes convinced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father has gone mad and is still
alive. The narrator works in spurts on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) freelance job illustrating a book of fairy
tales, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) worries prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) from accomplishing any real work. David proposes
staying on the island for a week. The narrator agrees, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) secretly fears her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
crazed father's reemergence. During their stay, David launches constant insults at
Anna, couching them as jokes. Anna confesses to the narrator that David is a
womanizer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) complains that David constantly demands that Anna wear makeup. The
four go on a blueberry-picking expedition. They canoe to a nearby island, where Joe
unexpectedly proposes to the narrator. The narrator refuses Joe, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) last husband and child. Back on the island, Paul arrives with an American named Malmstrom. Malmstrom
claims to be from a Detroit wildlife agency. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) offers to purchase the island, but
the narrator refuses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pulls Paul aside and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father is still
alive. Paul seems skeptical. After the visitors leave, David offhandedly accuses
Malmstrom of being a C.I.A. operative who is organizing an American invasion of
Canada. The narrator looks through her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's records and consequently believes
that he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) is likely dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) had been researching Indian wall paintings
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) had marked several sites on a map. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) decides to visit a site. The narrator convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) friends to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) on a camping trip to see
the wall paintings. On their way to the campsite, they see a decomposing blue heron
that has been hanged from a tree. David insists on filming the dead heron for a
movie he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) is making called Random Samples. The heron's death haunts
the narrator. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sees evidence of two campers entering the area beforehand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
quickly assumes that they are Americans and to blame for the crime. Meanwhile, the
four companions set up camp. Anna tells the narrator she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) has forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) makeup
and David will punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). The narrator goes fishing with David and Joe. They
encounter the Americans, and the narrator notices an American flag on their boat.
The narrator brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) companions to a site from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's map, but there are no
wall paintings. Frustrated and confused, they return to camp. On the way, they again
encounter the American campers. The narrator is surprised to discover that the
campers are actually Canadian; what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had thought was an American flag is actually
a sticker. However, the narrator claims the campers are still Americans because
their slaughter of the heron is a distinctly American action. The four return to the cabin. The narrator locates another site on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father's map but realizes that the government has raised the water level in this
part of the lake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will have to dive to see the paintings. Outside, the narrator
observes David tormenting Anna by insisting she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) clothes for
Random Samples. Anna eventually relents but then feels
humiliated. The narrator asks David why he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) tortures Anna, and David claims he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) does
so because Anna cheats on him (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>). The narrator canoes to a site from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's map.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dives repeatedly in search of the paintings. On a particularly deep dive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
sees a disturbing object and screams and swims for the surface. Joe has followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
onto the lake and demands to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)'s doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ignores Joe and realizes
that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw was a dead child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) believes it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) aborted baby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
changes her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) story from leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband and child to having an affair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
art professor and being forced to abort their baby. The narrator's vision throws her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) into a psychosis. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) believes that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father had found sacred Indian sites and resolves to thank the gods for granting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``the power.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Joe tries to speak to the narrator, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remains impenetrable. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)
tries to rape her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) alone once she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) warns him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will get
pregnant. Later, David tries to seduce the narrator, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that Joe and Anna
are having sex. The narrator nevertheless resists David's advances. A police boat
comes to the island, and David tells the narrator that the police have found her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father's body. Deep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) madness, the narrator refuses to believe David. That
night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seduces Joe so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) can get pregnant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feels that a new child will
replace her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lost baby. Joe falsely believes that the narrator has forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) for
cheating on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). On their last day on the island, the narrator abandons her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
destroys David's film and escapes in a canoe. The narrator's companions search in
vain for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), eventually leaving the island. Alone on the island, the narrator falls
deeper into madness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) destroys the art from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) job and nearly everything inside
the cabin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) becomes an animal, running around naked, eating unwashed plants, and
living in a burrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) imagines raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) baby outdoors and never teaching it
language. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) also has visions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) parents. Eventually, hunger and exhaustion
bring the narrator to sanity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looks at herself in the mirror and sees just a
natural woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) resolves not to feel powerless anymore. Paul arrives at the
island with Joe. The narrator realizes she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) loves Joe and resolves to reunite with
him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pauses in the cabin, looking out at Joe, waiting.
