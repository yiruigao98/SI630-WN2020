There are two small windows with drawn curtains, a door, and two ashbins covered by an old sheet. Hamm sits on an armchair with wheels, covered by an old sheet. Clov stares at Hamm, motionless. Clov staggers off-stage and returns with a stepladder and draws open the curtains for both windows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) removes the sheet from the ashbins and raises the lid of both and looks within. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) removes Hamm's sheet. Hamm, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) dressing-gown, a whistle hanging around his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) neck, and a handkerchief over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) face, appears to be asleep. Clov says, <div class="bookquote">``It's finished.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clov</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'ll go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) kitchen and wait for Hamm to whistle him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) leaves, then comes back, takes the ladders and carries it out. Hamm awakens and removes the handkerchief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) wears dark glasses. Hamm folds away his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) handkerchief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) questions whether anyone suffers as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) does. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) says <div class="bookquote">``it's time it ended,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``hesitate-LSB-s-RSB-''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) whistles and Clov enters. Hamm insults him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) and orders Clov to prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) for bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) asks what time it is, and Clov replies <div class="bookquote">``Same as usual.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clov</b></font>)</div>Hamm asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) has looked out the window, and Clov gives his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) report: <div class="bookquote">``Zero.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clov</b></font>)</div>Hamm commands him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) ready, but Clov doesn't move. Hamm threatens to hold back food from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>), and Clov goes for Hamm's sheet. Hamm stops him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) and asks why Clov stays with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>); Clov asks why Hamm keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>). For Hamm, there's no one else; for Clov, nowhere else. Hamm accuses Clov of leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)--Clov concedes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'s trying to do so--and that Clov doesn't love him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) asks why Clov doesn't kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>); Clov replies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) doesn't know the combination of the larder. From one of the ashbins, Nagg emerges in a nightcap. Nagg cries for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) pap, but since there's none left, Hamm whistles for Clov to get a biscuit. Nagg complains, and Hamm directs Clov to close the lid on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>). Clov says there's no more nature, and Hamm refutes this, arguing that their bodies and minds change. After some more debate, Hamm asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) does in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) kitchen. Clov says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) looks at the wall and sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) light dying. Nagg emerges from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) bin, biscuit in mouth, and listens. Hamm tells Clov to leave, which Clov says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'s <div class="bookquote">``trying''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to do and then does. Nagg knocks on the other bin, and Nell emerges. Nagg asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Nell</b></font>) to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>); they try but cannot reach, and Nell asks why they go through the <div class="bookquote">``farce''  (<font color='red'><b>Nell</b></font>)</div>every day. Their sight -LRB-and Nell's hearing-RRB- is failing. Hamm tells them to quiet down, and thinks about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) would dream of if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) could sleep. Nell rebukes Nagg for laughing at Hamm's misery. Nagg tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Nell</b></font>) a story about a tailor that has often made her (<font color='blue'><b>Nell</b></font>) laugh, especially the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) told it to the day after they'd gotten engaged: a tailor keeps botching and delaying a customer's orders for trousers until the customer explodes and points out that God created the world in six days, while the tailor has taken three months for the trousers. The tailor tells him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) to compare the world with his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) beautiful trousers. Hamm calls for silence. Nagg disappears, and Hamm whistles for Clov and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) to throw the bins into the sea. Clov checks Nell's pulse and says she (<font color='blue'><b>Nell</b></font>) has none. They discuss Hamm's painkiller medicine and Hamm's deceased former doctor. Hamm asks Clov to move him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) around on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) chair and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) can't see for himself, to hug the walls. Hamm directs Clov to return him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) spot in the exact center. Hamm tells Clov to check outside with the telescope. Clov's report is <div class="bookquote">``Zero.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clov</b></font>)</div>Clov asks why they go through the farce everyday, and Hamm answers that it is routine. Hamm wonders if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) and Clov are beginning to <div class="bookquote">``mean something'' (<font color='red'><b>Clov</b></font>)</div>; Clov scoffs at this notion. Clov scratches a flea on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) body. Hamm is astounded that there are still fleas, and begs Clov to kill it, as <div class="bookquote">``humanity might start from there all over again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clov</b></font>)</div>Clov gets some insecticide and sprinkles it inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) pants. Hamm proposes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) and Clov leave for the South. Clov declines, and Hamm says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'ll do it alone and tells Clov to build a raft. Clov says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'ll start, but Hamm stops him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) and asks if it's time for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) painkiller--it's not--and inquires about Clov's ailing body. Hamm asks why Clov doesn't <div class="bookquote">``finish''  (<font color='red'><b>Clov</b></font>)</div>them, but Clov says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) couldn't do it, and will leave. Hamm asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) remembers when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) came here, but Clov says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) was too small. Hamm asks if Clov remembers his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) father--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) doesn't--and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) was a father to Clov. Before Clov can leave, Hamm asks Clov if his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) dog is ready. Clov returns with a three-legged toy dog, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) gives to Hamm. Hamm tells Clov to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) gaff, and Clov wonders out loud why he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) never refuses his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) orders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) gets it for Hamm, who unsuccessfully tries to move his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) chair around with it. Hamm recollects a madman painter-engraver friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) who thought the end of the world had come, seeing ashes instead of nature. Hamm asks how he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'ll know if Clov has left. Clov decides he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'ll set an alarm clock, and if it doesn't ring, it means he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'s dead. Hamm says it's time for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) story, but Clov doesn't want to hear it. Hamm tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) to wake his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) father, and Clov looks into the ashbin of the sleeping Nagg. Clov reports that Nagg doesn't want to hear Hamm's story, and wants a sugarplum if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) must listen. Hamm agrees, and Clov leaves. Hamm asks Nagg why he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) produced him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>), and Nagg says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) didn't know that it would be Hamm. Hamm tells a story about how a beggarly man came crawling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) on Christmas Eve. The man revealed he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) had left behind a small boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) distant home, alone, and wanted food for the boy. Hamm says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) took the man into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) service, and was asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) would take the child, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) were still alive. Clov comes in and reports that there's a rat in the kitchen, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'s exterminated half of it. Hamm says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'ll finish it later, but now they'll pray to God in silence. They are all disappointed by the lack of a godly response, and Hamm believes God doesn't exist. Nagg remembers how Hamm would call him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) was scared as a child, and not his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) didn't listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) says, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) hopes the day will come again when Hamm will depend on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) knocks on Nell's lid, but with no response he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) retreats into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) bin and closes the lid. Hamm gropes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) dog. Clov hands it to Hamm, who soon after throws it away. Clov cleans up the room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) loves order, but Hamm makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) stop. Before Clov can leave, Hamm tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) to stay and listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) story; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) repeats the last bit, and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'s too tired to finish it, or to make up another story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) tells Clov to see if Nell is dead; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) looks into the bin and says it looks that way. Nagg hasn't died, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'s crying. Hamm asks Clov to push his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) chair under the window, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) wants to feel the light on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) feels sunshine, but Clov says it isn't really the sun. Clov pushes Hamm back to the center. Hamm twice calls for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) father, and tells Clov to see if Nagg heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>). Clov investigates and says Nagg isn't crying anymore, but sucking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) biscuit. Hamm asks Clov to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) on the forehead, or hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) hand, but Clov refuses. Hamm asks for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) dog, and then rejects the idea, and Clov leaves, vowing that either he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'ll kill the rat or it'll die. Alone, Hamm takes out his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) handkerchief and spreads it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) considers finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) story and starting another, or throwing himself on the floor, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) isn't able to push himself off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) ruminates on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) eventual death, and then whistles. Clov enters with the alarm clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) reports that the rat got away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>). Clov says it's time for Hamm's painkiller, which relieves him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) until Clov reveals there's none left. Hamm tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) to look at the earth. Clov reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) that after Mother Pegg asked Hamm for oil for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) lamp, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) refused her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) died of darkness. Hamm feebly says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) didn't have enough, but Clov refutes this. Clov wonders why he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) obeys Hamm, and Hamm answers that perhaps it's compassion. Clov finds the telescope. Hamm asks to be put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) coffin, but Clov says there is none left. Clov takes the telescope, goes up the stepladder, and sees a small boy out the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'ll investigate with the gaff -LRB-a hook-like tool-RRB-, presumably to kill off the <div class="bookquote">``potential procreator,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but Hamm says the boy will either die outside or come inside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) tells Clov that they've come to the end and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) doesn't need him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) anymore, and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) the gaff. Before Clov leaves, Hamm asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) to say something <div class="bookquote">``from your heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Clov repeats a few things <div class="bookquote">``They said to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clov</b></font>)</div>and reflects on the pain of life. Hamm stops him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) leaves and thanks him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) services. Clov thanks him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>), and Hamm says that they are obliged to each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) to cover him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) with the sheet, but Clov has already left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) tries to move the chair with the gaff. Clov enters, outfitted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) journey. Hamm doesn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>)'s there, and throws away the useless gaff. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) resumes telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) story about the man and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) child, repeating how the man wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) child with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>). Hamm recalls it was the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) was waiting for. Hamm twice calls out <div class="bookquote">``Father''  (<font color='red'><b>Hamm</b></font>)</div>and, not hearing anything, says, <div class="bookquote">``We're coming.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hamm</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) discards his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) dog and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) whistle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) calls out for Clov, but hears nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) takes out his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) handkerchief, unfolds it, and says <div class="bookquote">``You...remain.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) covers his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) face with the handkerchief and sits motionless.
