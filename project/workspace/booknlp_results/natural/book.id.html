He (<font color='blue'><b>Hobbs</b></font>) is on the train with the Cubs' scout, Sam Simpson. While on the train, Roy meets a woman named Harriet Bird, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) immediately develops a crush. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) also meets a sports journalist, Max Mercy, who is on the train with a famous baseball hitter, the Whammer. The train stops at a carnival, and Roy and the Whammer both show off their skills at games. Sam bets that Roy can strike out the Whammer, and Roy does. In the process, however, Roy accidentally hurts Sam, who dies later that day from the injury. When they reach Chicago, Harriet invites Roy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) room. After Roy tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) will be <div class="bookquote">``the greatest in the game,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) shoots him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>). Fifteen years later, Pop Fisher, the manager of the New York Knights, discovers he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) has a new <div class="bookquote">``rookie''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) team--a thirty-four-year-old man named Roy Hobbs, whom the team's owner, the stingy Judge Banner, has signed for a paltry $3,000. The Knights are doing very poorly; even their playing field is dried up from a long drought. Pop is skeptical of Roy. When Roy refuses to join the hypnotist sessions to which Pop subjects the team, Pop benches Roy for three weeks. In the meantime, Roy falls for Pop's niece, Memo Paris, but she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) is already the girlfriend of the team's star player, Bump Baily. Roy also meets Max Mercy, the sports journalist, again, but Mercy does not recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>). Finally, Pop sends Roy into a game one day to pinch-hit. Roy smashes the cover off the ball on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) first at-bat, and at the same time a downpour begins that lasts for three days. Soon, the field is green again and Roy is hitting regularly, wowing everyone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) amazing talent. Bump Baily takes offense at Roy's rise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) tries so hard to outdo Roy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) accidentally cracks his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) skull against the wall. Bump later dies from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) injuries; ultimately, Roy tries to move in on Memo. She (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) is cold and indifferent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) cannot stop thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>). When the Knights begin to rise in the standings due to Roy's amazing performance, Roy asks the Judge for a raise, but the Judge refuses. Roy runs into Max Mercy, who takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) out to a club owned by Gus Sands, the <div class="bookquote">``Supreme Bookie'' (<font color='red'><b>Gus/Gus Sands</b></font>)</div>--a millionaire tycoon of the betting circuit. Gus and Memo are sitting together when Roy and Max arrive. Gus wins some significant money from Roy, and Roy pays him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) back in the form of parlor tricks. A few weeks later, the fans hold <div class="bookquote">``Roy's Day,''  (<font color='red'><b>the fans</b></font>)</div>in which they shower him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) with cheers and gifts after hearing how poorly the Judge has been treating him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>). Roy even gets a car and takes Memo on a date. The date goes poorly, however, and Roy ends up crashing the car into a ditch. Neither of them are injured, but it is clear that Memo is not very interested in Roy. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) cannot stop obsessing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>). Shortly thereafter, Roy enters a slump, unable to get a single hit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) tries everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) can to end the slump, from superstitious tricks to meeting a fortuneteller. Pop tells Roy to stop using his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) bat, Wonderboy, and to try a different one, but Roy refuses. Just before a game in Chicago, a fan begs Roy to hit a home run; the fan told his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) son, who is fighting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) life in the hospital, that Roy said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) would. Pop lets Roy bat, and Roy immediately goes through two strikes. Then Roy notices a woman standing up in the crowd for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>). The woman gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) a kind of strength, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) nails a home run on the next hit. Roy decides to meet the woman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name is Iris Lemon. The two go on a date, and Iris seems to understand Roy very well. Unfortunately, Roy does not seem to understand Iris or what she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) is trying to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>). They go swimming and then make love, but Roy is shocked to discover that Iris, at age thirty-three, is already a grandmother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) soon tries to forget about her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>), focusing once more on Memo, who has ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) for weeks. Suddenly, as Roy is hitting well again, Memo begins to pay attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>), making him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) hunger for her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) even more. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) also hungers for vast amounts of food, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) begins to eat and eat. Memo holds a great banquet for all the players before an important three-game series, promising Roy sex after the banquet. But when Roy goes to her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) gets an enormous stomachache and winds up in the hospital. Meanwhile, the Knights lose their next three games, tying the Pirates for first place. Memo visits Roy at the hospital. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) asks her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) cannot do so unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) is sufficiently rich and can <div class="bookquote">``take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Shortly thereafter, Judge Banner visits Roy and offers him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) $35,000 to throw the next game, which will decide who wins the pennant. Roy reluctantly agrees, and the next day at the game, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) does not play his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) best. However, Roy slowly begins to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) mind. At one at-bat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) is viciously booed by a dwarf named Otto P. Zipp. Roy tries to foul off several pitches toward the dwarf; one finally hits the dwarf, but caroms off the dwarf's skull and hits a woman that had stood up in the stands--Iris Lemon. Iris tells Roy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) is pregnant with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) child, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) must win the game for both the child and the two of them. Roy agrees and goes back to the plate ready to crack one. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) does so, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) bat, Wonderboy, splits in half. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) next at-bat, Roy is once again ready to conquer, though not with Wonderboy. The opposing team's pitcher is so terrified of Roy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) faints dead away. The other team sends out a young phenom pitcher instead. Roy suddenly finds himself in the place of the Whammer, striking out against a young, fantastic pitcher. Distraught after the game, Roy visits the Judge and beats him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) up, along with Gus Sands. Roy throws the Judge's money at him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) and calls Memo a whore. Memo tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>whore</b></font>) has hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``murdered Bump.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Roy leaves and sees a newspaper: Max Mercy has discovered Roy's sellout. A boy asks Roy, <div class="bookquote">``Say it ain't so, Roy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roy/Roy Hobbs</b></font>)</div>Roy can only weep in response.
