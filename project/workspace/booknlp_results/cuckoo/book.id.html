narrator of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, has
been a patient in an Oregon psychiatric hospital for ten years.
His (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) paranoia is evident from the first lines of the book, and he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
suffers from hallucinations and delusions. Bromden's worldview is
dominated by his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) fear of what he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) calls the Combine, a huge conglomeration
that controls society and forces people into conformity. Bromden
pretends to be deaf and dumb and tries to go unnoticed, even though
he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) is six feet seven inches tall. The mental patients, all male, are divided into Acutes,
who can be cured, and Chronics, who cannot be cured. They are ruled
by Nurse Ratched, a former army nurse who runs the ward with harsh, mechanical
precision. During daily Group Meetings, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) encourages the Acutes
to attack each other in their most vulnerable places, shaming them
into submission. If a patient rebels, he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) is sent to receive electroshock
treatments and sometimes a lobotomy, even though both practices
have fallen out of favor with the medical community. When Randle McMurphy arrives as a transfer from the Pendleton
Work Farm, Bromden senses that something is different about him (<font color='blue'><b>Randle</b></font>).
McMurphy swaggers into the ward and introduces himself as a gambling
man with a zest for women and cards. After McMurphy experiences
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first Group Meeting, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tells the patients that Nurse Ratched
is a ball-cutter. The other patients tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that there is no defying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>), because in their eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) is an all-powerful force. McMurphy
makes a bet that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can make Ratched lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) temper within a week. At first, the confrontations between Ratched and McMurphy provide
entertainment for the other patients. McMurphy's insubordination,
however, soon stimulates the rest of them into rebellion. The success
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bet hinges on a failed vote to change the television schedule
to show the World Series, which is on during the time allotted for
cleaning chores. McMurphy stages a protest by sitting in front of
the blank television instead of doing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work, and one by one the
other patients join him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Nurse Ratched loses control and screams
at them. Bromden observes that an outsider would think all of them
were crazy, including the nurse. In Part II, McMurphy, flush with victory, taunts Nurse
Ratched and the staff with abandon. Everyone expects him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) to get
sent to the Disturbed ward, but Nurse Ratched keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) in the regular
ward, thinking the patients will soon see that he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) is just as cowardly
as everyone else. McMurphy eventually learns that involuntarily
committed patients are stuck in the hospital until the staff decides
they are cured. When McMurphy realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) is at Nurse Ratched's mercy,
he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) begins to submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) authority. By this time, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>)
has unintentionally become the leader for the other patients, and they
are confused when he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) stops standing up for them. Cheswick, dismayed
when McMurphy fails to join him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) in a stand against Nurse Ratched,
drowns in the pool in a possible suicide. Cheswick's death signals to McMurphy that he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) has unwittingly taken
on the responsibility of rehabilitating the other patients. He (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) also
witnesses the harsh reality of electroshock therapy and becomes
genuinely frightened by the power wielded by the staff. The weight
of his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) obligation to the other patients and his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) fear for his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) own
life begins to wear down his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) strength and his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) sanity. Nevertheless,
in Part III, McMurphy arranges a fishing trip for himself and ten
other patients. He (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) shows them how to defuse the hostility of the outside
world and enables them to feel powerful and masculine as they catch
large fish without his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) help. He (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) also arranges for Billy Bibbit to
lose his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) virginity later in the novel, by making a date between Billy
and Candy Starr, a prostitute from Portland. Back on the ward in Part IV, McMurphy reignites the rebellion by
getting into a fistfight with the aides to defend George Sorenson. Bromden
joins in, and they are both sent to the Disturbed ward for electroshock
therapy. McMurphy acts as if the shock treatments do not affect
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heroic reputation grows. Nurse Ratched brings him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) back
to the ward so the other patients can see his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) weakened state. The
patients urge McMurphy to escape, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has arranged Billy's date
for that night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) refuses to let Billy down. McMurphy bribes
Mr. Turkle, the night aide, to sneak Candy into the hospital, and
they have a party on the ward. Billy has sex with Candy while McMurphy
and the other patients smoke marijuana and drink. Harding tries
to get McMurphy to escape with Candy and Sandy to Mexico, but McMurphy
is too wasted and falls asleep. The aides discover the mess the next morning, setting
off a series of violent events. When Nurse Ratched finds Billy with
Candy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) threatens to tell Billy's mother. Billy becomes hysterical
and commits suicide by cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) throat. McMurphy attacks Ratched,
ripping open the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) dress and attempting to strangle her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>).
In retaliation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) has him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) lobotomized, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) returns to the ward
as a vegetable. However, Ratched has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) tyrannical power over the
ward. The patients transfer to other wards or check themselves out
of the hospital. Bromden suffocates McMurphy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) bed, enabling
him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) to die with some dignity rather than live as a symbol of Ratched's
power. Bromden, having recovered the immense strength that he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) had
believed lost during his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) time in the mental ward, escapes from the
hospital by breaking through a window.
