the royal family of York and the royal family of Lancaster, England
enjoys a period of peace under King Edward IV and the victorious Yorks.
But Edward's younger brother, Richard, resents Edward's power and
the happiness of those around him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). Malicious, power-hungry, and
bitter about his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) physical deformity, Richard begins to aspire secretly
to the throne--and decides to kill anyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has to in order to become
king. Using his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) intelligence and his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) skills of deception and
political manipulation, Richard begins his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) campaign for the throne.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) manipulates a noblewoman, Lady Anne, into marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)--even though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) own older
brother, Clarence, executed, and shifts the burden of guilt onto
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sick older brother King Edward in order to accelerate Edward's
illness and death. After King Edward dies, Richard becomes lord
protector of England--the figure in charge until the elder of Edward's
two sons grows up. Next Richard kills the court noblemen who are loyal to
the princes, most notably Lord Hastings, the lord chamberlain of England.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) then has the boys' relatives on their mother's side--the powerful
kinsmen of Edward's wife, Queen Elizabeth--arrested and executed.
With Elizabeth and the princes now unprotected, Richard has his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
political allies, particularly his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) right-hand man, Lord Buckingham,
campaign to have Richard crowned king. Richard then imprisons the
young princes in the Tower and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) bloodiest move yet, sends
hired murderers to kill both children. By this time, Richard's reign of terror has caused the
common people of England to fear and loathe him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has alienated nearly
all the noblemen of the court--even the power-hungry Buckingham.
When rumors begin to circulate about a challenger to the throne
who is gathering forces in France, noblemen defect in droves to
join his (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) forces. The challenger is the earl of Richmond, a descendant
of a secondary arm of the Lancaster family, and England is ready
to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>). Richard, in the meantime, tries to consolidate
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) wife, Queen Anne, murdered, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) can
marry young Elizabeth, the daughter of the former Queen Elizabeth
and the dead King Edward. Though young Elizabeth is his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) niece, the
alliance would secure his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) claim to the throne. Nevertheless, Richard has
begun to lose control of events, and Queen Elizabeth manages to
forestall him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). Meanwhile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) secretly promises to marry young Elizabeth
to Richmond. Richmond finally invades England. The night before the
battle that will decide everything, Richard has a terrible dream
in which the ghosts of all the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has murdered appear and
curse him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) will die the next day. In the battle
on the following morning, Richard is killed, and Richmond is crowned
King Henry VII. Promising a new era of peace for England, the new
king is betrothed to young Elizabeth in order to unite the warring
houses of Lancaster and York.
