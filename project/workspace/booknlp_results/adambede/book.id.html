a small village in England, in 1799. She
stays with her (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Poyser, although she (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>)
plans to return soon to Snowfield, where she (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) normally lives. Seth
Bede, a local carpenter, loves her (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) and is learning to live with
her (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) rejection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) marriage proposal. Seth's brother, Adam Bede,
also lives in Hayslope and works as the foreman at the carpentry
shop where he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) brother work. Adam loves a seventeen-year-old
village beauty named Hetty Sorrel. Hetty, who is Mr. Poyser's niece,
lives with the Poysers and helps with the chores. Thias Bede, the father of Seth and Adam, drowns in the
river near their house after a drinking binge. Their mother, Lisbeth,
is distraught. Dinah goes to comfort Lisbeth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is able to
soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) where no one else can. Lisbeth wishes that Dinah could
be her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) daughter-in-law. The local landlord, Squire Donnithorne, rules the parish
with an iron fist. His (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grandson and heir, Captain Donnithorne, who
is a member of the regimental army, has broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) arm and is living with
the Squire. The villagers all respect and adore Captain Donnithorne,
who considers himself a gallant man. Captain Donnithorne flirts
secretively with Hetty after first meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) at the Poysers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) will next be visiting the Squire's residence and
arranges to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) alone in the woods when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) passes through. When Captain Donnithorne meets up with Hetty in the woods, they
are alone for the first time and both are bashful. Captain Donnithorne
teases Hetty about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) many suitors, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
arms around her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) then immediately panics at the inappropriateness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) advances and runs off. Later Captain Donnithorne meditates
on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has done and decides he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) needs to see Hetty to clear up
what happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) meets her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) way back through the woods, and
they kiss. This encounter begins a summer-long affair, which only
ends when Captain Donnithorne leaves to rejoin his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) regiment. Hetty
believes that Captain Donnithorne will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) into
the great socialite she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dreams of being. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) does not exactly
love him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) loves the wealth and privilege he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) represents. Captain Donnithorne throws a coming-of-age party for himself to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) invites all the members in the parish. Everyone comes and
has a wonderful time with a feast, dancing, and games. Adam discovers
that Hetty is wearing a locket that Captain Donnithorne gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) becomes suspicious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) might have a secret lover but concludes
that it would not be possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to conceal such a thing from
the Poysers. On the last night Captain Donnithorne is in town, Adam
catches him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) kissing Hetty in the woods. Adam and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) have a fight,
which Adam wins. Captain Donnithorne lies to Adam that the affair
was no more than a little flirtation. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) response, Adam tells
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must write a letter to Hetty letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) know that the affair
is over. Captain Donnithorne does so, and Adam delivers the letter.
Hetty is crushed, but after some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) resolves to marry Adam
as a way out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) current life. Adam proposes, and Hetty accepts.
By the time Captain Donnithorne leaves, Hetty is pregnant, although
neither of them knows it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) resolves to go out to find Captain
Donnithorne because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cannot bear to have those who know her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) find out
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) believes that Captain Donnithorne will help
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) feels he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) can never erase her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shame. Hetty sets out to locate Captain Donnithorne. At the end
of an arduous journey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) learns that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has gone to Ireland. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
heads in the direction of home, more or less intending to visit
Dinah, who she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) believes will help her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) without judging her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). Along
the way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) gives birth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) child. Distraught, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) takes the
child into the woods and buries it under a tree. Hetty goes away,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cannot escape the sound of the child's cry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) returns
to where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) left the baby. A farm laborer and the Stoniton constable
discover her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and the constable takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) into custody for the murder
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) child. Adam is distraught when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) cannot find Hetty and concludes that
Captain Donnithorne must have lured her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) away from their upcoming
marriage. Before traveling to Ireland to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) first goes
to Mr. Irwine to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) plan. Mr. Irwine tells Adam that
Hetty is in jail for murder. Adam goes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) trial, even though the
situation troubles him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Dinah arrives and is able to reach Hetty through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) depression and convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) must repent to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
soul. Hetty is convicted and sentenced to die. At the last possible moment, Captain Donnithorne arrives
with a stay of execution. Hetty is transported, meaning that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
is sent away from England for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) crimes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) dies just before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
is set to return to Hayslope. Captain Donnithorne goes away for
a few years because of the shame he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has brought on the Poysers and
Adam. Adam realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is in love with Dinah. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) proposes,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) rejects him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) comes to realize that it is God's
will that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) marry Adam. They are married, and they have two children.
Seth lives with them and does not marry. Captain Donnithorne ultimately
returns to Hayslope, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and Adam meet one last time at the conclusion
of the novel. They are able to stay friends despite all that has
come between them.
