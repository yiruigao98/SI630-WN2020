when Charles Bovary is a young boy, unable to fit in at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) new
school and ridiculed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) new classmates. As a child, and later
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grows into a young man, Charles is mediocre and dull. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
fails his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) first medical exam and only barely manages to become a
second-rate country doctor. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother marries him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) off to a widow
who dies soon afterward, leaving Charles much less money than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
expected. Charles soon falls in love with Emma, the daughter of
a patient, and the two decide to marry. After an elaborate wedding,
they set up house in Tostes, where Charles has his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) practice. But
marriage doesn't live up to Emma's romantic expectations. Ever since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lived in a convent as a young girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has dreamed of love
and marriage as a solution to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) problems. After she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attends
an extravagant ball at the home of a wealthy nobleman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) begins
to dream constantly of a more sophisticated life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) grows bored
and depressed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) compares her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fantasies to the humdrum reality of
village life, and eventually her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listlessness makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ill. When Emma
becomes pregnant, Charles decides to move to a different town in
hopes of reviving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) health. In the new town of Yonville, the Bovarys meet Homais,
the town pharmacist, a pompous windbag who loves to hear himself
speak. Emma also meets Leon, a law clerk, who, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), is bored
with rural life and loves to escape through romantic novels. When
Emma gives birth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) daughter Berthe, motherhood disappoints
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had desired a son--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) continues to be despondent. Romantic
feelings blossom between Emma and Leon. However, when Emma realizes
that Leon loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feels guilty and throws herself into the
role of a dutiful wife. Leon grows tired of waiting and, believing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) can never possess Emma, departs to study law in Paris. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
departure makes Emma miserable. Soon, at an agricultural fair, a wealthy neighbor named
Rodolphe, who is attracted by Emma's beauty, declares his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) love to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) seduces her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and they begin having a passionate affair.
Emma is often indiscreet, and the townspeople all gossip about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
Charles, however, suspects nothing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) adoration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stupidity combine to blind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) indiscretions. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) professional
reputation, meanwhile, suffers a severe blow when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and Homais
attempt an experimental surgical technique to treat a club-footed
man named Hippolyte and end up having to call in another doctor
to amputate the leg. Disgusted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband's incompetence, Emma
throws herself even more passionately into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affair with Rodolphe.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) borrows money to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gifts and suggests that they run off
together and take little Berthe with them. Soon enough, though,
the jaded and worldly Rodolphe has grown bored of Emma's demanding
affections. Refusing to elope with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Heartbroken,
Emma grows desperately ill and nearly dies. By the time Emma recovers, Charles is in financial trouble
from having to borrow money to pay off Emma's debts and to pay for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) treatment. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) decides to take Emma to the opera in the
nearby city of Rouen. There, they encounter Leon. This meeting rekindles the
old romantic flame between Emma and Leon, and this time the two
embark on a love affair. As Emma continues sneaking off to Rouen
to meet Leon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) also grows deeper and deeper in debt to the moneylender
Lheureux, who lends her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more and more money at exaggerated interest
rates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) grows increasingly careless in conducting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affair
with Leon. As a result, on several occasions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) acquaintances
nearly discover her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) infidelity. Over time, Emma grows bored with Leon. Not knowing how
to abandon him (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) instead becomes increasingly demanding. Meanwhile,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) debts mount daily. Eventually, Lheureux orders the seizure of
Emma's property to compensate for the debt she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has accumulated.
Terrified of Charles finding out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) frantically tries to raise
the money that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) needs, appealing to Leon and to all the town's
businessmen. Eventually, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even attempts to prostitute herself
by offering to get back together with Rodolphe if he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) will give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the
money she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) needs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) refuses, and, driven to despair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) commits suicide
by eating arsenic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dies in horrible agony. For a while, Charles idealizes the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife.
Eventually, though, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) finds her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) letters from Rodolphe and Leon,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) is forced to confront the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) dies alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) garden,
and Berthe is sent off to work in a cotton mill.
