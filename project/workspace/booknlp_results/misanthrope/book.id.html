Alceste identifies hypocrisy as one of mankind's worst flaws. Despite Philinte's objections, Alceste insists that truth and honesty, no matter how painful, are essential to true integrity. Philinte contends that honesty must be balanced with manners, arguing that flattery might justly take the place of offensiveness. He (<font color='blue'><b>aristocrat</b></font>) believes that human nature should be allowed its faults. Over the course of the conversation, we learn that Alceste is presently involved in a lawsuit. During the conversation between Alceste and Philinte, Oronte, a marquis of the Court enters, proposing that he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) and Alceste commit to being friends. Alceste makes no such commitment, suggesting that they get to know each other first. Shortly thereafter, Oronte asks Alceste to critique a sonnet he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) has written. Alceste reluctantly agrees. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) despises the poem, and scolds Philinte for flattering Oronte. When Oronte asks Alceste's opinion, Alceste suggests that Oronte give up his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) aspirations as a poet. Insulted, Oronte leaves. Alceste confronts his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) love interest Célimène -LRB-whose house is the setting for the play-RRB- about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alceste</b></font>) recent behavior, which he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) considers inappropriate. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) criticizes her (<font color='blue'><b>Alceste</b></font>) for entertaining too many suitors; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alceste</b></font>) insists that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alceste</b></font>) flirtation is harmless and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alceste</b></font>) true affections lie with him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>). Célimène's manservant, Basque, announces the arrivals of Acaste and Clitandre, two marquises hoping to court Célimène. In protest, Alceste announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) will leave, but he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) does not. All of Célimène's suitors, excluding Alceste, gather with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alceste</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alceste</b></font>) female cousin, Éliante, to hear Célimène's gossip about the people of the Court. Célimène criticizes harshly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alceste</b></font>) suitors are highly entertained. Alceste interjects during Célimène's discussions to object to the hypocrisy at hand. Everyone dismisses his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) comments. Éliante delivers her (<font color='blue'><b>Alceste</b></font>) ideas about men in love, mentioning that Alceste's disposition is abnormal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alceste</b></font>) contends that smitten men typically compliment those with whom they are in love. An Officer of the Marshals of France arrives to inform Alceste that a lawsuit has been filed against him (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) by Oronte, who seeks retribution for Alceste's comments about his (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) poem. Alceste leaves to deal with the matter. Acaste and Clitandre find a moment alone to discuss their affections for Célimène. Acaste strokes his (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) own ego, bragging about his (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) youth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) wealth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) appeal to women. His (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) cheerfulness dissolves, however, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) admits that Célimène does not care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>). Clitandre and Acaste decide that, should one of them fall out of favor with Célimène for good, he (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) will step aside and support the other's courtship. Arsinoé, a cantankerous older woman, arrives to tell Célimène that the people of the court have been talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``flirtatiousness.''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>Arsinoé claims to have taken Célimène's side in the affair, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suggests that Célimène change her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) behavior promptly to avoid further conflict. Célimène comments on Arsinoé's flaws, implying that Arsinoé's pretentiousness is also a topic of conversation. Arsinoé takes offense when Célimène states that the older woman's flaws might just be the result of age. The dispute ends when Alceste arrives, at which point Célimène leaves. Arsinoé praises Alceste's integrity and offers to use her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) influence to acquire him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a position at Court. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) scoffs at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) offer. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) then tells Alceste that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a letter proving Célimène's deception of him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Alceste leaves with Arsinoé to see the evidence for himself. Philinte and Éliante discuss Alceste's extraordinarily foul behavior before the Marshals of France. Philinte can hardly believe Alceste's unwillingness to compromise, while Éliante praises Alceste's commitment to his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own value system. When their conversation turns to Alceste's relationship with Célimène, Éliante states that Célimène is confused and does not know whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loves. Éliante admits that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would accept Alceste's advances if he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were to abandon Célimène at any point. Philinte then admits his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attraction to Éliante, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be honored to be hers. As Philinte and Éliante finish their conversation, Alceste enters, infuriated and seeking revenge against Célimène for deceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by professing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attraction to another suitor. Alceste proposes that he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Éliante strike up a relationship in order to make Célimène jealous. Éliante cautions Alceste not to be hasty in his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) judgment. Philinte and Éliante exit as Célimène enters. Alceste berates Célimène for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) infidelity. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reacts calmly, calling him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``foolish''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to believe what he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wishes about the letter. Desperate, Alceste commands Célimène to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that the letter was actually written to a woman. Célimène refuses this request, and Alceste rages about his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uncontrollable love for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Alceste's servant, Du Bois, enters, telling his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) master to leave immediately, as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) court battle and now runs the risk of arrest. Alceste leaves to find out more about the situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) finds Philinte, who counsels him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to challenge the verdict issued against him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). Alceste refuses, stating that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wants the verdict to stand as an example of human corruption. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) will isolate himself from society forever. Before leaving, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) plans to test Célimène's love by asking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to retire with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). Shortly thereafter, Alceste and Oronte confront Célimène, both demanding that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) choose between them. Célimène refuses to do so, stating that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plans to let Éliante make the decision for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). When Éliante enters, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refuses to do Célimène's bidding. Then, Acaste and Clitandre enter with a letter written by Célimène that contains insulting remarks about each of the suitors. Arsinoé and Philinte return. The men read the letter aloud, each of them declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wish to end whatever courtship he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had with Célimène. Eventually, Alceste is the only suitor remaining. For once, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) is willing to forgive Célimène, but he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must first agree to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) in solitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is shocked by his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) proposal, explaining to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is too young to make such a drastic decision. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) agrees to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), but not to leave with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). Furious, Alceste renounces his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) love for Célimène. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leaves, and Alceste turns to Éliante, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that it would be unjust for him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) devotion. Éliante professes agreement, announcing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) decision to devote herself to Philinte. Alceste exits, and Philinte and Éliante follow to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to rethink his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) decision to retire into isolation.
