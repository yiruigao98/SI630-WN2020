which the author, Harriet Jacobs, states her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reasons for writing an autobiography.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) story is painful, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would rather have kept it private, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feels that
making it public may help the antislavery movement. A preface by abolitionist Lydia
Maria Child makes a similar case for the book and states that the events it records
are true. Jacobs uses the pseudonym Linda Brent to narrate her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) first-person account.
Born into slavery, Linda spends her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) early years in a happy home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) mother and
father, who are relatively well-off slaves. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) mother dies, six-year-old Linda
is sent to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) mother's mistress, who treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) well and teaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) to
read. After a few years, this mistress dies and bequeaths Linda to a relative. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>)
new masters are cruel and neglectful, and Dr. Flint, the father, soon begins
pressuring Linda to have a sexual relationship with him (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>). Linda struggles against
Flint's overtures for several years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) pressures and threatens her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) defies
and outwits him (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>). Knowing that Flint will eventually get his (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) way, Linda consents to a
love affair with a white neighbor, Mr. Sands, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) is ashamed of this
illicit relationship but finds it preferable to being raped by the loathsome Dr.
Flint. With Mr. Sands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) has two children, Benny and Ellen. Linda argues that a
powerless slave girl cannot be held to the same standards of morality as a free
woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) also has practical reasons for agreeing to the affair: she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) hopes that
when Flint finds out about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) will sell her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) to Sands in disgust. Instead, the
vengeful Flint sends Linda to his (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) plantation to be broken in as a field hand. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) discovers that Benny and Ellen are to receive similar treatment,
Linda hatches a desperate plan. Escaping to the North with two small children would
be impossible. Unwilling to submit to Dr. Flint's abuse, but equally unwilling to
abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) family, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) hides in the attic crawl space in the house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>)
grandmother, Aunt Martha. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) hopes that Dr. Flint, under the false impression that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) has gone North, will sell her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) children rather than risk having them disappear as
well. Linda is overjoyed when Dr. Flint sells Benny and Ellen to a slave trader who
is secretly representing Mr. Sands. Mr. Sands promises to free the children one day
and sends them to live with Aunt Martha. But Linda's triumph comes at a high price.
The longer she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) stays in her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) tiny garret, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) can neither sit nor stand, the
more physically debilitated she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) becomes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) only pleasure is to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) children
through a tiny peephole, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) cannot risk letting them know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) is. Mr.
Sands marries and becomes a congressman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sands</b></font>) brings Ellen to Washington, D.C., to
look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Sands</b></font>) newborn daughter, and Linda realizes that Mr. Sands may never free
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) children. Worried that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sands</b></font>) will eventually sell them to slave traders, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>)
determines that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) must somehow flee with them to the North. However, Dr. Flint
continues to hunt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>), and escape remains too risky. After seven years in the attic, Linda finally escapes to the North by boat.
Benny remains with Aunt Martha, and Linda is reunited with Ellen, who is now nine
years old and living in Brooklyn, New York. Linda is dismayed to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>)
daughter is still held in virtual slavery by Mr. Sands's cousin, Mrs. Hobbs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>)
fears that Mrs. Hobbs will take Ellen back to the South, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) beyond Linda's
reach forever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) finds work as a nursemaid for a New York City family, the Bruces,
who treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) very kindly. Dr. Flint continues to pursue Linda, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) flees to
Boston. There, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) is reunited with Benny. Dr. Flint now claims that the sale of
Benny and Ellen was illegitimate, and Linda is terrified that he (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) will re-enslave all
of them. After a few years, Mrs. Bruce dies, and Linda spends some time living with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) children in Boston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) spends a year in England caring for Mr. Bruce's
daughter, and for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) enjoys freedom from racial
prejudice. When Linda returns to Boston, Ellen goes to boarding school and Benny
moves to California with Linda's brother William. Mr. Bruce remarries, and Linda
takes a position caring for their new baby. Dr. Flint dies, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) daughter, Emily,
writes to Linda to claim ownership of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>). The Fugitive Slave Act is passed by
Congress, making Linda extremely vulnerable to kidnapping and re-enslavement. Emily Flint and her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) husband, Mr. Dodge, arrive in New York to capture Linda.
Linda goes into hiding, and the new Mrs. Bruce offers to purchase her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) freedom. Linda
refuses, unwilling to be bought and sold yet again, and makes plans to follow Benny
to California. Mrs. Bruce buys Linda anyway. Linda is devastated at being sold and
furious with Emily Flint and the whole slave system. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) remains
grateful to Mrs. Bruce, who is still her (<font color='blue'><b>Bruce</b></font>) employer when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bruce</b></font>) writes the book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bruce</b></font>)
notes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bruce</b></font>) still has not yet realized her (<font color='blue'><b>Bruce</b></font>) dream of making a home for herself and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bruce</b></font>) children to share. The book closes with two testimonials to its accuracy, one
from Amy Post, a white abolitionist, and the other from George W. Lowther, a black
antislavery writer.
