Troilus is assisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) pursuit of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) by Pandarus, Cressida's uncle. Meanwhile, in the Greek camp, the Greek general, Agamemnon, wonders why his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) commanders seem so downcast and pessimistic. The wise and crafty Ulysses informs him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) that the army's troubles spring from a lack of respect for authority, brought about by the behavior of Achilles, the greatest Greek warrior, who refuses to fight and instead spends his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) time sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) tent with his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) comrade -LRB-and lover-RRB- Patroclus, mocking his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) superiors. Shortly thereafter, a challenge to single combat arrives from Prince Hector, the greatest Trojan warrior, and Ulysses decides to have Ajax, a headstrong fool, fight Hector instead of Achilles, in the hopes that this snub will wound Achilles's pride and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) back into the war. In Troy, the sons of King Priam debate whether it is worthwhile to continue the war--or whether they should return Helen to the Greeks and end the struggle. Hector argues for peace, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) is won over by the impassioned Troilus, who wants to continue the struggle. In the Greek camp, Thersites, Ajax's foul-mouthed slave, abuses everyone who crosses his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) path. His (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master, meanwhile, has been honored by the commanders over the sulking Achilles, and is to fight Hector the next day. That night, Pandarus brings Troilus and Cressida together, and after they pledge to be forever true to one another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) leads them to a bedchamber to consummate their love. Meanwhile, Cressida's father, the treacherous Trojan priest Calchas, asks the Greek commanders to exchange a Trojan prisoner for his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) daughter, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) may be reunited with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). The commanders agree, and the next morning--to Troilus and Cressida's dismay--the trade is made, and a Greek lord named Diomedes leads Cressida away from Troy. That afternoon, Ajax and Hector fight to a draw, and after Hector and Achilles exchange insults, Hector and Troilus feast with the Greeks under a flag of truce. As the camp goes to bed, Ulysses leads Troilus to the tent of Calchas, where the Trojan prince watches from hiding as Cressida agrees to become Diomedes's lover. The next day, in spite of unhappy premonitions from his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) wife, sister, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) father, Hector takes the field, and a furious and heartbroken Troilus accompanies him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>). The Trojans drive the Greeks back, but Patroclus is killed, which brings a vengeful Achilles back into the war, finally. Achilles is unable to defeat Hector in single combat, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) later catches him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) unarmed and, together with a gang of Greek warriors, slaughters him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>). Achilles then drags Hector's body around the walls of Troy, and the play ends with the Trojan warriors retreating to the city to mourn their fallen hero.
