Tremain is the gifted apprentice of Ephraim Lapham, a silversmith
in Revolutionary-era Boston. The pious and elderly Mr. Lapham is
more interested in preparing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapham</b></font>) own soul for death than in running
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapham</b></font>) silver shop, so Johnny is the chief breadwinner of the family.
Dove and Dusty, Lapham's other apprentices, are expected to bow
to Johnny's authority, and Mrs. Lapham is determined to have Johnny marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapham</b></font>) daughter Cilla. Johnny's enormous talent and his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) special status
in the Lapham household go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapham</b></font>) head, and Johnny often bullies the
lazy, insolent Dove, as well as Dusty and the four Lapham daughters.
Although Mr. Lapham tries to contain Johnny's arrogance, Johnny
is unwilling to rein in his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) quick temper or impulsive acts. The Lapham's fortune and Johnny's fame as a silversmith
appear to take a turn for the better when the wealthy merchant John
Hancock puts in an order for an elaborate silver basin. Mr. Lapham
hesitates to take on such a difficult project, but the rash Johnny
accepts the job on behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) master. That night, Johnny reveals
his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) family secret to Cilla. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is related to Jonathan Lyte, a wealthy
Boston merchant. Johnny's mother revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) ancestry to him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) before
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) a silver cup engraved with the Lyte's coat
of arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) instructed him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) to steer clear of the Lytes unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>)
had no other recourse. Johnny struggles to design the silver basin's
handles, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is dissatisfied with the result. After consulting
Paul Revere, Johnny creates a mold for a perfect set of handles.
While he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is casting the wax model in silver, Dove deliberately hands
him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) a cracked crucible. Dove's intention is only to humble Johnny
by playing a practical joke on him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) prank results in a terrible
accident that disfigures Johnny's hand. No longer able to work as
a silversmith's apprentice, Johnny loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) status in the Lapham
household. After the burn heals, Mrs. Lapham begins to complain
of Johnny's idleness and the expense of feeding him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapham</b></font>) begins negotiating
a business partnership with Mr. Tweedie, a silversmith from Baltimore,
and forbids Johnny from marrying Cilla. Mr. Lapham urges Johnny
to find a new trade, but promises to house him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) finds a
new master. During his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapham</b></font>) fruitless search, Johnny drops into
Mr. Lorne's print shop, where a Whig newspaper, the Boston
Observer, is published. Mr. Lorne's enigmatic nephew and
apprentice Rab immediately intrigues Johnny. Johnny confides the
story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) accident to Rab, and the boy promises Johnny a job delivering
newspapers if he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) fails to find any skilled labor. Depressed and desperately trying to find a new
craft, Johnny finally decides to approach Jonathan Lyte. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) produces
his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) silver cup as proof of their kinship, but Lyte accuses Johnny
of stealing the valuable heirloom and has the boy arrested. Johnny
appeals to Rab for assistance, and Rab not only finds a lawyer to
defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) for free but also arranges to have Cilla testify in his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>)
favor. After Johnny is cleared of the charges, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) tries to sell
the cup to Lyte, but Lyte steals it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>). Only then does Johnny
approach Lorne to ask for the delivery job. While delivering newspapers, Johnny becomes well acquainted with
the key members in Boston politics and is transformed from an apathetic
political bystander into an ardent Whig. The Lornes treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) kindly,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) were a member of their family. Johnny participates in the
Boston Tea Party, and becomes a confidant, small-time Whig spy,
and errand boy for all the Whigs of Boston. During this period of
Whig scheming, in the months leading up the Revolutionary War, Johnny
slowly changes from a selfish, arrogant child into a selfless, idealistic
man. Rab's quiet influence teaches Johnny to control his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) temper,
and the colonial situation provides Johnny with something larger
than himself to care about. Johnny also matures through his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) growing
recognition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) feelings for Cilla, who has gone to work as a
servant in the Lyte home. On the eve of war between the colonists and Britain,
the Tory Lytes plan to flee to England. Immediately before their
departure, Lavinia Lyte approaches Johnny to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) has
investigated his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) claims of kinship and found them to be legitimate.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) insists that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) father had sincerely believed that Johnny was
lying when he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>), but admits that both father and daughter
recognize that Johnny has a right to some of the Lyte property. Rab is mortally wounded when war breaks out
in the battle of Lexington. Johnny is deeply shaken by Rab's death,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) vows to continue the struggle for the human rights for which
Rab sacrificed his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) life. Doctor Warren, an esteemed rebel leader,
examines Johnny's hand while Rab's lifeless body lies upstairs.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) discovers that the thumb is fused to the palm by nothing but
scar tissue, and that Johnny's handicap can be easily remedied with
minor surgery. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) cannot promise that Johnny will ever
be a silversmith again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) assures Johnny that he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) will
soon be able to fire the musket that Rab bequeathed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) before
dying.
