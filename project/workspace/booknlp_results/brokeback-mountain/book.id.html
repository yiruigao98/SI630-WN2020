Ennis, a middle-aged ranch hand, wakes before five in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) trailer. The ranch's owner has sold the place, and Ennis must move out this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) is unsure of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) will do, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) will go, or what his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) next job will be, but for now the uncertainty is assuaged by the pleasure of a dream he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) has just had about a man named Jack Twist. The story leaps backward in time, to the spring of 1963, when Ennis and Jack first meet at the trailer office of Wyoming's Farm and Ranch Employment. The narration shifts into past tense, signaling the beginning of the narrative of which we have just glimpsed the ending. Jack and Ennis are teenagers, born and bred in opposite corners of Wyoming on poor ranches. Both are well acquainted with a life of hard work and rough living, and both are high school dropouts. Ennis lost both parents when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) was young and grew up in the care of two older siblings. At age fourteen he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) received a hardship grant for a truck to drive to school, but the truck soon broke down and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) went to work on a ranch. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) is engaged to Alma Beers. Jack and Ennis sign on to become sheep herder and camp tender, respectively, for a foreman, Joe Aguirre, whose livestock spend the summer on Brokeback Mountain. Jack has done this once before, but Ennis is new to the job. Aguirre instructs the herder to sleep with the sheep in a pup tent, armed but without a fire, to prevent coyotes from killing the animals. Jack and Ennis drink and talk in a bar, then head up the mountain and get to work. After Jack complains about the four-hour commute to get to the herd, the men switch roles: Ennis heads up the mountain while Jack prepares meals in the camp. When they are together, they talk, drink whiskey, and become friends. The men move the sheep to graze in a farther field, increasing the distance between pasture and base camp. One cold night, after much talking and drinking, Ennis decides to remain in base camp rather than trek back to the herd. It's freezing and Jack tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sleeping roll inside the warm tent. In the tent, Jack reaches for Ennis's hand and pulls it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) groin, only to be roughly turned and entered from behind by Ennis--the first time Ennis has been with a man. The sex happens many times after that, but they deny their homosexuality. During a surprise visit to the campsite, Joe Aguirre sees the men together through his (<font color='blue'><b>Aguirre</b></font>) binoculars. In August, the sheep get mixed up with a Chilean herd, and Ennis and the Chilean herder struggle to separate them. In late August, Aguirre calls the men and sheep down from the mountain and frowns as he (<font color='blue'><b>Aguirre</b></font>) pays Jack and Ennis, knowing that some of the sheep aren't his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>). The two men say goodbye, each evasive about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) plans for the next summer. Jack has a bruised jaw--Ennis had punched him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) the day before. They part ways as though they don't care. Once Jack is out of sight, Ennis has to pull over because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) is sick with grief. Ennis marries Alma and has two girls, getting work as a wrangler and on a highway crew to support his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) family. Alma wants to live in town, but Ennis likes the impermanence of their remote apartment. Four years pass. Jack sends Ennis a postcard saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) is coming to town, and Ennis replies with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) address. When Jack arrives, Ennis runs to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>). Alma steps outside and sees them kissing in front of their apartment, then quickly goes back inside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alma</b></font>) comes out again when the men have separated, and Ennis introduces Jack to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alma</b></font>). The men tell each other about the children they have. Jack has married a Texan girl, Lureen. The men go to a motel, where they have sex all night. The next day, they reminisce about their time on Brokeback and talk about their feelings. Ennis says he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) hasn't slept with other men, and Jack lies and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hasn't either. Jack tells Ennis he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) thinks Aguirre knew what happened on the mountain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) tells Ennis he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) was surprised by the punch on the last day. Ennis says his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) brother used to punch him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) finally punched his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) brother one day, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) by surprise. Jack suggests they set up a ranch together. But Ennis tells Jack about the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) father took him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>), as a child, to see the mutilated body of a gay rancher. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) says they just have to endure this separation. A rift grows between Alma and Ennis, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alma</b></font>) divorces him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) when their daughters are nine and seven. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alma</b></font>) remarries. At a Thanksgiving dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alma</b></font>) confronts Ennis about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) affair with Jack, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) storms out. The two men continue to see each other occasionally, but they never return to Brokeback. They tell each other about their affairs with women. During one trip, Ennis tells Jack he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) won't be able to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) until November, although they'd planned to meet in August. While Jack has his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife's money and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) inherited business to fall back on, Ennis lives paycheck to paycheck and can't miss work. Jack admits he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) travels to Mexico for sex because Ennis can't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) enough of a life. They argue, but nothing is resolved. Jack remembers a time on Brokeback when Ennis simply embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) and stood with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) by the fire. Months later, a postcard Ennis has mailed to Jack is returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>), stamped <div class="bookquote">``DECEASED.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Ennis calls Lureen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says that Jack had an accident: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was changing a tire when it blew up, sending the rim into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face. Ennis thinks it was no accident and that men killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) with the tire iron. Lureen says Jack wanted to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ashes interred in a place called Brokeback Mountain, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) didn't know where it was, so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) buried half the ashes and gave the rest to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) parents. Ennis decides to visit Jack's family in Lightning Flat, Wyoming. Ennis is met by Jack's mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) disapproving father in their tiny, depressing ranch house. Mr. Twist says Jack had long spoken of coming home to Lightning Flat with Ennis to help run the ranch, but had recently begun talking of bringing home another man, a Texan, instead. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) mother invites Ennis to see Jack's room. In the closet Ennis discovers an old shirt of Jack's, stained with Ennis's blood, layered over a shirt of Ennis's, from their Brokeback days. Jack's father says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son's ashes in the family plot. Ennis buys a postcard of Brokeback and tacks it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) trailer wall; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ennis</b></font>) hangs the two shirts beneath it on a nail. Around this time, Jack begins to appear in Ennis's dreams.
