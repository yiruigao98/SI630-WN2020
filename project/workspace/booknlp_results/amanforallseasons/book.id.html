objects to King Henry VIII's plan to divorce and remarry in order
to father a male heir. But More, ever the diplomat, keeps quiet
about his (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) feelings in the hopes that Henry will not bother him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) about
the matter. At a meeting with Cardinal Wolsey, Lord Chancellor of
England, More reviews the letter to Rome that requests the pope's
approval of Henry's divorce. More points out that the pope provided
a dispensation, or exemption, in order for Henry to get married
in the first place, since Catherine, the woman Henry married, was
the widow of Henry's brother. More doubts that the pope will agree
to overturn his (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) first dispensation. Wolsey accuses More of being
too moralistic and recommends that he (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) be more practical. After conversing with Wolsey, More runs into Thomas Cromwell,
the king's confidante. Cromwell, recently promoted to the position
of cardinal's secretary, insincerely tells More he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) is one of More's
greatest admirers. More also meets Signor Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador
to England. Chapuys takes More's noncommittal response to questions
about his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) meeting with Wolsey to mean that More agrees that the
divorce should not go through. Chapuys stresses Christian morals
and Catholic dogma and seems most concerned that Henry does not
insult Henry's wife, Catherine, who is also the king of Spain's
aunt. Chapuys thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has found an ally in More. Back at More's home, More's daughter, Margaret, has received
a visit from Roper, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) Lutheran boyfriend, despite the late hour. Roper
asks More for Margaret's hand, but More refuses to allow a Lutheran,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roper</b></font>) eyes a heretic, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roper</b></font>) family. Meanwhile, Wolsey dies, leaving the position of Lord
Chancellor vacant. The king was displeased with Wolsey's failure
to secure a papal dispensation to annul his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) marriage to Catherine,
and Wolsey died in disgrace. More is appointed as Wolsey's replacement. Cromwell meets with Richard Rich, a low-level functionary whom
More helped establish and to whom More gave a silver cup he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) was
given as a bribe. -LRB-More did not realize that the cup was a bribe
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) received it.-RRB- Cromwell tempts Rich with an opportunity for
advancement, and the spineless Rich seems all too eager to accept
the job in exchange for information he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) has about More. Rich and
Chapuys, who has just entered, ask Cromwell what his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) current position
is, and Cromwell announces simply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) does whatever the king
wants done. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mentions that the king has planned a boat ride down
the Thames to visit More. Meanwhile, More's manservant, Matthew
-LRB-played by the Common Man-RRB-, has entered the room, and Cromwell,
Rich, and Chapuys are eager to bribe him (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) for information. Matthew
tells them only the most well known facts about his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) master, but
the trio pays him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) off anyway. Back at More's home in London's Chelsea district, the
king is set to arrive, but More is nowhere to be found. After fretting
over his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) absence, the family eventually finds him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) busy at vespers
-LRB-evening prayers-RRB-. When the king arrives, all are on their best
behavior, and More comes off as the most flattering of all. However,
More does tell the king that More cannot agree to the divorce, reminding
him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) that the king promised not to bother More about it. The king
storms off, telling More he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) will leave him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) alone provided More does
not speak out against the divorce. Alice, More's
wife, is angry at his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) behavior and thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) husband should do
as Henry wants. Rich arrives to tell More that Cromwell and Chapuys
are collecting information about him (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) asks for employment, but
More turns him (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) away. At a local pub called the Loyal Subject, Cromwell meets
Rich to conspire against More. Rich is reluctant and guilt-ridden,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) ultimately agrees to tell Cromwell about the bribe that More received
and passed on to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>). In exchange, Cromwell offers Rich a job. Parliament passes the Act of Supremacy, which establishes
the Church in England and appoints King Henry as its head. More decides
that if the English bishops decide to go along with the act, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will
resign as Lord Chancellor. Both Chapuys and Roper call it a remarkable
<div class="bookquote">``gesture,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roper</b></font>)</div>but More, dead set against the act, thinks of it as a
practical necessity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roper</b></font>) refuses to explain himself to anyone but
the king. Even his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife and daughter cannot know his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) reasons, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) does not want to put them in the position of having to testify
against him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) later. Cromwell meets with the Duke of Norfolk and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) plan to bring More up on bribery charges. Norfolk proves
that More gave the cup to Rich as soon as More realized it was a
bribe, and Cromwell is forced to come up with some other way to
entrap More. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) tells Norfolk, however, that the king expects him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
to participate in the persecution of More. A now impoverished More refuses to receive a letter of
appreciation from the king of Spain, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) turns down the bishops'
sincere offer of charity. Cromwell calls More to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) office and
attempts to malign More by accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of sympathizing with the
Holy Maid of Kent, who was executed for treason. Cromwell also accuses
him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of having written a book attributed to King Henry. More deconstructs
both these charges, but when Cromwell reads a letter from King Henry
calling More a villain, More is genuinely shaken. Meeting Norfolk
outside, More insists that if he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wishes to remain in the king's
favor, Norfolk should cease to be his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) friend, since by this point
it is dangerous to know a man like More. Parliament passes another
act, this time requiring subjects to swear an oath to King Henry's
supremacy in England over the Church and to the validity of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
divorce and remarriage. The next time we see More, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is in jail
for having refused to take the oath. Cromwell, Norfolk, and the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Thomas Cranmer, interrogate More in prison, but they cannot trick
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) into signing the oath or divulging his (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) opinions on the king's
behavior. As long as More refuses to talk or sign the oath, Cromwell
can keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) locked up but cannot have him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) executed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) removes
More's books but lets his (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) family visit, hoping that they will be
able to reason with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>). Though More's daughter, Margaret, tries
to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has done all he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can, More refuses to relent.
Alice finally sympathizes fully with More's predicament, and, displaying
their full love toward each other, they reconcile just before the
jailer -LRB-the Common Man-RRB- insists that the visit is over. Cromwell gives Rich the office of attorney general for
Wales in exchange for Rich's false testimony at More's trial. Though
More never opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) mouth, Rich claims he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) heard More deny the
king's authority over the Church. More is sentenced to death but
not before he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) can express his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) disapproval of the Supremacy Act and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) disappointment with a government that would kill a man for keeping
quiet. More goes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) death with dignity and composure, and the
play ends with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) beheading.
