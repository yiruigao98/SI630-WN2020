Francie Nolan is eleven years old, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) brother are collecting junk to exchange for pennies. The first child of Katie and Johnny Nolan, Francie loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) neighborhood. This particular Saturday is typical. Francie runs many errands for her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) mother, makes a daily trip to the library, and spends a relaxing afternoon watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) neighbors from the fire escape. Although the Nolans live in a humble apartment in a run down section of town, they fill their home with warmth and love. Johnny Nolan, a young Irish man, sings and waits tables for some extra money, but most of the financial support falls to Katie, who works as a janitor in the building in exchange for rent. The beginning of Book II flashes back to a summer in 1900 when Katie and Johnny first met. Katie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) friend Hildy O'Dair worked in a factory, and Hildy dated a young boy named Johnny Nolan. When Katie first danced with Johnny, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) mind to endure any hardship, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) could only spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) life with Johnny. They fell in love and got married within six months. Katie came from a family of strong Austrian women; Johnny was one of many weak and talented men in his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) family. The young Johnny and Katie support themselves by working as janitors in a public school, but their lives become more stressful when Katie becomes pregnant. A year after Francie is born, Katie gives birth to a boy, Neeley, who will be her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) favorite. The stress of living in poverty and having children causes Johnny to become weaker and undependable, while Katie's fighting instinct kicks in. Johnny's drinking problem gets worse and the Nolans move after a binge on his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) twenty-first birthday brings shame to their family. They love their new apartment on Lorimer Street, and stay until Katie's sister, Sissy, makes some mistakes that shame the family. The house on Grand Street is the third and last of the Nolans's homes in Brooklyn. Neeley and Francie start school the same year. Francie has anticipated school with great delight, but finds the neighborhood school cruel and mean. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) love for learning is juxtaposed with the cruelties of the teachers and other children. One day, Francie happens upon a beautiful school that she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) could attend. Johnny figures out a way for Francie to transfer to this kinder school, where rich children are not favored over poor children like Francie. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) never makes many friends, school becomes a more positive place for Francie. Growing up, Francie and Neeley enjoy all the holidays throughout the year. At this point in the book, the flashback ends, and we return to the point at which the book begins. Through many experiences, Francie loses the innocence that marks her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) character when the book begins. One of these experiences is the tree-throwing ritual. One Christmas, Francie and Neeley participate in an old Brooklyn tree-catching tradition. They remain standing while the biggest tree in the lot is thrown straight at them. Although they are thrilled with the thought of a Christmas tree, the reader understands the cruelty of this ritual, especially when Katie begins to worry that her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) children do not even know the hardship they live in. Another loss of innocence occurs with Francie's run-in with a sex offender. Katie is prepared with a gun, and shoots the criminal, and Francie emerges relatively unscathed. Still, this is Francie's first experience with sex of any kind; around this time, Francie also starts her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) period, and becomes more aware of the social taboos surrounding women's sexuality. Francie becomes more aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) father's problems with alcohol. As Francie grows up, Johnny comes home drunk more and more often. Little by little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) becomes more worthless as a breadwinner, and ultimately, his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) dismissal from the Union puts him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) over the edge. Also, Katie is pregnant again, which the narrator suggests, makes Johnny all the weaker. Johnny dies Christmas Day, five months before his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) daughter, Annie Laurie, is born. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) father's death is an important event for Francie's character development. Up till this point, Francie has gone along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) family's Catholic traditions. Now, Francie stops believing in God. She (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) also respected her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) teachers a great deal, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) English marks especially were important to her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>). Now, Francie begins to write <div class="bookquote">``sordid''  (<font color='red'><b>Francie</b></font>)</div>compositions in response to her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) father's death. Although the teacher disapproves, Francie refuses comply with her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) order to burn her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) ugly compositions, and instead burns the flowery compositions that had nothing to do with Francie's life experiences. Burning all of the pretty, flowery compositions is a symbolic loss of innocence for Francie. At the same time, the reader sees that Francie is becoming more aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) identity, more aware of the kind of writer and person she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) wants to be. Although Francie's attitudes toward school and religion may be seen as rebellious, she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) has not lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) sensitive, caring nature. Francie takes care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) mother in the few days before her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) delivery, and although she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) and Katie fight, Francie values her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) more, knowing the pain and suffering of losing a parent. At the same time, Katie can never replace Johnny for Francie. Sissy accompanies Francie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) school graduation, where Francie finds red roses sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) from Johnny, who gave Sissy the money for them two years before. At this moment, Francie grieves for all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) has lost--Johnny, and the innocence that disappeared when he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) died. Francie and Neeley have to go to work the summer after eighth grade graduation, as Katie cannot support them all. Francie starts working in a factory and then gets a job in a clippings bureau, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) reads papers from all over the country, and learns about the world. One day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) and Neeley proudly present their first week's pay to Katie. Although Francie has a good job, she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) desperately wants to go to high school. Unfortunately, Katie allows Neeley to go back to school instead of Francie, since they can only afford to send one. The Nolans have more money now with Francie's job, and live more comfortably than they used to. Although Francie never does go to high school, she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) manages to enroll in college summer classes. America enters World War I, and the world is changing. Technological advances allow Sissy to give birth to a live baby in a hospital. Francie's first bout with romantic love mirrors the political and economic changes in the world. One day Francie meets a young soldier, Lee Rynor who she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) falls in love with in 48 hours. Lee goes home and marries his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) fianc√©e before going to war, leaving Francie with a broken heart. Eventually, Francie finds that she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) enjoys the company of Ben Blake a successful boy she (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) met at summer school. The climax of the novel comes whenSergeant McShane asks Katie to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) is a good man who will make it possible for Laurie to grow up without hardship, and Francie and Neeley to go to college. The Nolans move out of their apartment the day before the wedding while Francie gets ready to leave for college at University of Michigan. And the Tree of Heaven in her (<font color='blue'><b>Francie</b></font>) yard keeps on growing.
