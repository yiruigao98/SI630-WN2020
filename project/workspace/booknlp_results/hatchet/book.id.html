His (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) parents' recent divorce weighs heavily on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>), as does <div class="bookquote">``The Secret''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) mother is having an affair. The pilot gives him (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) a very brief flying lesson in which Brian has control of the plane for a few minutes. The pilot seems to be experiencing increasing pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) shoulder, arm, and stomach. At first Brian does not think it is very serious, but as the pilot begins jerking in his (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) seat it becomes clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) is having a heart attack. The attack stops and the pilot is dead; Brian is forced to take over the controls. After a harrowing descent, the plane crashes into a lake in the Canadian woods, where Brian is stranded. Brian has little to eat and is injured from the crash, but believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) will soon be rescued. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) finds some strange berries to eat, which make him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) extremely sick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) then finds a raspberry patch, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) spots a bear. Brian constructs a shelter and in the middle of the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) hears a noise. A porcupine has entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) shelter and Brian throws the hatchet in its direction. It shoots its quills into Brian's leg, causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) severe pain. Brian attempts to build a fire with no matches and eventually succeeds when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) learns how to strike his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) hatchet against a stone to ignite sparks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) finds turtle eggs and eagerly eats them. One day a plane flies overhead but does not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) and continues on its way, leaving Brian devastated and hopeless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) attempts to commit suicide by cutting himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) hatchet, but survives the attempt and emerges from the experience determined to embrace life and to take an active role in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) own fate. Brian soon catches his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) first fish and enjoys a big feast. That night, however, a skunk enters the shelter and when Brian yells at the skunk, it sprays him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>), temporarily blinding him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) and covering him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) with a horrible stench. Brian perfects his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) tools and catches a foolbird, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) first meat. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) is cleaning the bird in the water, a moose attacks Brian, injuring his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) ribs and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) shoulder. Another unfortunate incident soon follows when a tornado sweeps over the woods and destroys Brian's shelter. The day after the tornado, Brian discovers that the chaotic storm has riled up the water in the lake, and the tail of the plane had emerged from the lake, reminding Brian of the dead pilot and compelling him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) to say a few words for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>). Lying in bed one night, it occurs to Brian that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) could seek out the survival pack in the body of the plane, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) determines to build a raft to do so. After many incidents of trial-and-error, Brian retrieves the survival pack from the plane. At one point he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) drops the hatchet to the lake's bottom, but retrieves it with a long dive. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) way back up to the surface, Brian sees the dead pilot's head underwater, partially eaten by fish. Brian gets sick in the water but manages to make it back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) shelter to get some sleep. The next morning Brian opens the survival pack, which contains countless useful items, some of which Brian rejects in favor of the self-sufficient methods he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) has developed during his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) time in the woods. However, there is freeze-dried food that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) decides to cook immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) also finds something labeled <div class="bookquote">``Emergency Transmitter.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) fiddles with it but it appears not to function. As Brian is preparing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) much-anticipated meal, a plane lands on the lake to rescue a dumbfounded Brian sitting down to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) freeze-dried meal.
