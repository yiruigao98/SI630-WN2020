This early education is supplemented when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) goes off to college and eventually becomes a medical student at the University of Winnemac, where he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) meets his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) life-time mentor, Max Gottlieb, a German professor committed to laboratory science and research. While in medical school, Martin dates a girl named Madeleine Fox, a snobbish, educated doctoral student of literature and becomes engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Madeleine</b></font>), only to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Madeleine</b></font>) later for Leora Tozer, a down-to-earth nurse in training, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) will love and live with until the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Madeleine</b></font>) life. Also, while at Winnemac, under the wing of Gottlieb, Martin develops a deep-rooted love for the laboratory and lashes out against <div class="bookquote">``commercialism''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>and the faults of the practicing physician versus the ideals of true science and research. Nevertheless, Martin, after graduating from Winnemac, must abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``true science''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>because he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has married Leora and now has a wife to support. Martin and Leora move to Leora's hometown of Wheatsylvania where Martin becomes a country doctor about whom the townspeople gossip. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is at times successful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) never gains the trust of the community as a whole and loses a patient, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) early days. Leora also has a miscarriage during their time in Wheatsylvania. Feeling as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has failed in Wheatsylvania, Martina and Leora move to Nautilus, a city in the Midwest. In Nautilus, Martin becomes a public health physician, working under Dr. Pickerbaugh, who is more of a salesman than a doctor and who writes verses about hygiene and cleanliness. After being unhappy in Nautilus, Martin is called to the Rouncefield Clinic in Chicago to work with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) medical school colleague, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had always been in competition, Angus Duer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Angus</b></font>) work as a pathologist in the Rouncefield Clinic, however, also proves disheartening given that the Clinic is a playground for doctors who care more for money than anything else. It is at this point that Martin comes to the attention of Max Gottlieb once again. Gottlieb, who is working at the prestigious McGurk Research Institute in New York -LRB-modeled after the Rockefeller Institute in New York-RRB-, invites Martin to join the research team. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is glad to finally have his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) chance at laboratory science, the <div class="bookquote">``true science''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had had to abandon. Martin is happy there until he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) begins to be rushed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) study and work. The heads of the Institute begin to pry into his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) research in order to apply pressure on Martin to publish and <div class="bookquote">``sell''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) work. While at the institute, however, Martin comes across a huge triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) research, the isolation of a bacteriophage that seems to kill pneumonia and plague. Although there is some initial disappointment at finding out that much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) research had already been done and published by another scientist, Martin decides to further his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) research and is successful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) continuations. Martin is later sent to test his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) discovery in the Caribbean island of St. Hubert, which is infested with plague. Martin agrees to conduct his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) experimental research on the quarantined island of St. Hubert. Leora accompanies him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). On the island of St. Hubert, Martin is meant to conduct further research on the phage in order to understand it better, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does, in fact, seem to cure the people of the plague. However, the research conducted on the island is not altogether precise because Martin had given up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) work for a time, after the tragedy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wife's -LRB-Leora-RRB- death due to the plague. Martin goes through a period of mourning in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) abandons his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) research, a period which he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) will later be upset by and consider a failure on his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) behalf. It is also on the island that Martin meets Joyce Lanyon, an immensely wealthy woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) marries when he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) returns to New York, after Leora's death. Martin, however, cannot grow fully accustomed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) new wife's rich ways and finds himself, once again, unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), therefore, abandons her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) child with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in order to retreat into the woods with Terry Wickett, his (<font color='blue'><b>Terry</b></font>) friend and colleague from the McGurk Institute. The book ends with Martin and Terry's plan to build a laboratory in Terry's home in the woods so that they may be left to do the important research they so love and need without the commercial pressure imposed by department heads and the presidents of institutes.
