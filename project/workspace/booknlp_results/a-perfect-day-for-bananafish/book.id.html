The hotel is full for a sales convention, so she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) must wait a long time. She (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) fixes her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) clothing, paints her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) nails, and reads a magazine. When the call does go through, Muriel reassures her (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) anxious mother about her (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) safety. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) mother is concerned about the erratic, reckless behavior of Seymour, Muriel's husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) hints at a car accident that Seymour and Muriel were involved in and suggests that Seymour deliberately crashed Muriel's father's car into a tree. She (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) reminds Muriel of the strange and rude things Seymour has said to members of Muriel's family. Seymour has recently returned from the war, and Muriel's mother believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) was discharged from the military hospital prematurely. Muriel is not as concerned as her (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) is preoccupied by the fashion at the resort and the evening's events. In the evenings, there are formal dinners and cocktail parties, at which Seymour often sits apart, playing the piano. The resort is full of society people, although Muriel feels that the quality of these people has diminished since the war. She (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) mother that Seymour is on the beach by himself. On the beach, three-year-old Sybil Carpenter lets her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) mother put sunscreen on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) body. Mrs. Carpenter then sends Sybil away so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carpenter</b></font>) can go have cocktails. Sybil wanders far from the part of the beach where the hotel guests are situated. Eventually, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) finds Seymour, who knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) likes her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) blue bathing suit, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) suit is yellow. Sybil accuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) of letting another little girl, Sharon Lipschutz, sit on the bench with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lipschutz</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lipschutz</b></font>) played the piano. Seymour assures Sybil that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) favorite. Sybil tells Seymour he (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) should push Sharon off the piano bench next time. As they get ready to go into the ocean, Seymour tells Sybil they should look for bananafish. They then discuss the tigers in one of Sybil's children's books, Black Sambo, as well as Sybil's fondness for olives and wax. Sybil asks Seymour whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) likes Sharon Lipschutz, and Seymour tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) does, especially the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) is nice to small dogs and always kind. In the water, Seymour puts Sybil onto the raft and says it's a perfect day for bananafish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) explains that these are normal-looking fish that swim into banana holes and greedily eat all the bananas inside. As a result, the bananafish become so fat that they cannot leave their holes and die. Doubtful of the fish at first, Sybil tells Seymour that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) sees a bananafish with six bananas in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) mouth. Seymour kisses the arch of Sybil's foot. Sybil protests, and when they get out of the water, Sybil runs back to the hotel. Seymour, alone again, collects his (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) things and returns to the resort. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) accuses a woman in the elevator of looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) feet. When the woman denies it, Seymour becomes irate, calling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``God-damned sneak.''  (<font color='red'><b>Seymour</b></font>)</div>The woman leaves the elevator. Seymour proceeds to his (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) room, where Muriel is napping. Sitting on the other bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) watches her (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) takes a gun from his (<font color='blue'><b>Seymour</b></font>) luggage and shoots himself in the head.
