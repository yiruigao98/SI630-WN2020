Jeanette's mother is a fundamentalist Christian and dominants Jeanette's life. Jeanette's father is almost never present. Up until the age of seven Jeanette's mother had educated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) at home, mostly by teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) to read the Bible. Jeanette's mother adopted Jeanette because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) wanted to acquire a child in a sexless manner whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) could train to be a servant to God. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) mother has instilled in Jeanette the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) is unique and will eventually become a missionary to the world. Jeanette does not know anyone aside from the other members of the church until at the age of the seven her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) mother is ordered to send Jeanette to school. Jeanette also lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) hearing at the age of seven. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) condition was misdiagnosed for a long time since her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) mother and the congregation believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) was in a state of rapture. After another church member, Miss Jewsbury discovered that Jeanette simply has a physical ailment, and Jeanette is treated at the hospital. Following her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) operation, Jeanette spends a lot of time with another church member Elsie who teaches Jeanette about poetry and other worldly phenomena like Wagner. At school, Jeanette is always an outcast because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) evangelical beliefs. The teachers shun her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) essays that deal with missionary work. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) art projects that quote biblical text are equally disdained. Ultimately, one teacher, Mrs. Vole, informs Jeanette that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) is obsessed by God and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) has been scaring the other students with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) talk of Hell. Mrs. Vole sends a letter to Jeanette's mother about this issue, but Jeanette's mother reacts with elation rather than anger. Eventually, Jeanette stops making projects that refer to biblical themes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) still finds that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) remains an outcast. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) ages, Jeanette realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) sometimes disagrees with the teachings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) congregation. Jeanette particularly disagrees with one sermon about the nature of perfection. Although Jeanette begins to see some difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) ideas and those of the church, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) still is closely aligned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) mother who is a motivating member of their Society for the Lost. As Jeanette grows older she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) starts to think about romance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) worries about whether or not men are beasts and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) listens intently to other women's complains and opinions about their husbands. One day Jeanette and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) mother go downtown and Jeanette sees a compelling girl named Melanie working at a fish stall. Jeanette tries to talk to Melanie, but Melanie cannot talk on that day. Soon after Jeanette is offered a job washing dishes in a nearby ice cream shop and spends her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) Saturdays working and looking at Melanie. Eventually, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) and Melanie become friends. Jeanette brings Melanie to their church and on the first visit Melanie agrees to be saved by Jesus Christ. After this, Jeanette frequently visits Melanie's house for Bible study. As the two spend more time together, they start having a love affair. Jeanette eventually tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) mother about how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) loves and needs Melanie because Jeanette feels so happy. The following Sunday at church the pastor publicly confronts them about their fallen state. Melanie repents immediately, but Jeanette argues and flees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) takes refuge at the house of Miss Jewsbury, who is herself a lesbian, and that evening Miss Jewsbury and Jeanette sleep together. The following day the elders of the church attempt to exorcise the demons from Jeanette by laying hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) for fourteen hours. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) still will not repent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) mother locks her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) in the parlor for thirty- six hours with no food. After this hungry spell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) pretends to repent, but maintains her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) has not done anything wrong by loving both Melanie and God. Melanie disappears and Jeanette becomes deeply involved in the church again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) role in the church has grown and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) now preaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) own sermons and teaches Sunday school. Soon Jeanette begins a new affair with Katy, a recent convert. When they are caught one weekend, Jeanette takes all the blame saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) had been with Melanie. The church then decides that Jeanette has been given too much responsibility so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) now almost thinks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) is a man. They insist that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) give up teaching and preaching. Instead, Jeanette quits the church. Jeanette's mother forces her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) to leave their home since her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) evilness will bring illness to them all. With no home, friends, or money, Jeanette takes up various jobs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) works in a funeral parlor, as an ice cream truck driver, and eventually at a mental hospital. On occasion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) runs into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) mother or members of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) congregation who treat Jeanette coldly and say she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) is possessed by demons. Eventually she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) moves to the city. After an unspecified time, Jeanette does return home one winter to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) mother still faithfully believes, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) Society for the Lost has been shaken by corruption. Jeanette's mother does not discuss Jeanette's lifestyle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) behavior indicates that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) has softened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) beliefs. Jeanette's mother still listens to the missionary reports on the radio system with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanette</b></font>) usual fervor.
