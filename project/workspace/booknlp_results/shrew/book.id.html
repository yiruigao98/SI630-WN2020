poor tinker named Christopher Sly becomes the target of a prank
by a local lord. Finding Sly drunk out of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) wits in front of an
alehouse, the lord has his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) men take Sly to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) manor, dress him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) finery, and treat him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) as a lord. When Sly recovers, the men
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is a lord and that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) only believes himself to
be a tinker because he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) has been insane for the past several years.
Waking in the lord's bed, Sly at first refuses to accept the men's
story, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hears of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>a pageboy dressed in women's
clothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) readily agrees that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is the lord they purport him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
to be. Sly wants to be left alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) wife, but the servants
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) that a troupe of actors has arrived to present a play for
him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). The play that Sly watches makes up the main story of The
Taming of the Shrew. In the Italian city of Padua, a rich young man named
Lucentio arrives with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) servants, Tranio and Biondello, to attend
the local university. Lucentio is excited to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) studies,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) priorities change when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees Bianca, a beautiful, mild
young woman with whom Lucentio instantly falls in love. There are
two problems: first, Bianca already has two suitors, Gremio and
Hortensio; second, Bianca's father, a wealthy old man named Baptista
Minola, has declared that no one may court Bianca until first her (<font color='blue'><b>Bianca</b></font>)
older sister, the vicious, ill-tempered Katherine, is married. Lucentio
decides to overcome this problem by disguising himself as Bianca's
Latin tutor to gain an excuse to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bianca</b></font>) company. Hortensio disguises
himself as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bianca</b></font>) music teacher for the same reason. While Lucentio
pretends to be Bianca's tutor, Tranio dresses up as Lucentio and
begins to confer with Baptista about the possibility of marrying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Baptista</b></font>) daughter. The Katherine problem is solved for Bianca's suitors
when Hortensio's friend Petruchio, a brash young man from Verona, arrives
in Padua to find a wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intends to marry a rich woman, and
does not care what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is like as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
agrees to marry Katherine sight unseen. The next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes to Baptista's
house to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>), and they have a tremendous duel of words. As
Katherine insults Petruchio repeatedly, Petruchio tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) agrees or not. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tells Baptista,
falsely, that Katherine has consented to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on Sunday. Hearing
this claim, Katherine is strangely silent, and the wedding is set. On Sunday, Petruchio is late to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own wedding, leaving Katherine
to fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) will become an old maid. When Petruchio arrives, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is dressed in a ridiculous outfit and rides on a broken-down horse.
After the wedding, Petruchio forces Katherine to leave for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country
house before the feast, telling all in earshot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) is now his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
property and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleases. Once they reach
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country house, Petruchio continues the process of <div class="bookquote">``taming''  (<font color='red'><b>Petruchio</b></font>)</div>Katherine
by keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) from eating or sleeping for several days--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pretends
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) so much he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inferior
food or to sleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poorly made bed. In Padua, Lucentio wins Bianca's heart by wooing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bianca</b></font>)
with a Latin translation that declares his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love. Hortensio makes
the same attempt with a music lesson, but Bianca loves Lucentio,
and Hortensio resolves to marry a wealthy widow. Tranio secures
Baptista's approval for Lucentio to marry Bianca by proposing a
huge sum of money to lavish on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bianca</b></font>). Baptista agrees but says that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptista</b></font>) must have this sum confirmed by Lucentio's father before the
marriage can take place. Tranio and Lucentio, still in their respective
disguises, feel there is nothing left to do but find an old man
to play the role of Lucentio's father. Tranio enlists the help of
an old pedant, or schoolmaster, but as the pedant speaks to Baptista,
Lucentio and Bianca decide to circumvent the complex situation by
eloping. Katherine and Petruchio soon return to Padua to visit
Baptista. On the way, Petruchio forces Katherine to say that the
sun is the moon and that an old man is really a beautiful young
maiden. Since Katherine's willfulness is dissipating, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) agrees
that all is as her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) husband says. On the road, the couple meets
Lucentio's father, Vincentio, who is on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way to Padua to see
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son. In Padua, Vincentio is shocked to find Tranio masquerading
as Lucentio. At last, Bianca and Lucentio arrive to spread the news
of their marriage. Both Vincentio and Baptista finally agree to
the marriage. At the banquet following Hortensio's wedding to the widow,
the other characters are shocked to see that Katherine seems to
have been <div class="bookquote">``tamed'' (<font color='red'><b>Katherine</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) obeys everything that Petruchio says and gives
a long speech advocating the loyalty of wives to their husbands.
When the three new husbands stage a contest to see which of their
wives will obey first when summoned, everyone expects Lucentio to
win. Bianca, however, sends a message back refusing to obey, while Katherine
comes immediately. The others acknowledge that Petruchio has won
an astonishing victory, and the happy Katherine and Petruchio leave
the banquet to go to bed.
