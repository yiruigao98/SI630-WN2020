With a sensitive, observant style, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) records her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) adolescent woes: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) worries about what her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) crush Roger thinks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) loathes her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) weight gain; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fears her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) budding sexuality; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is uncomfortable at school; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has difficulty relating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) parents. Alice's father, a college professor, accepts a teaching position at a different college and the family will move at the start of the new year, which cheers Alice up. The move is difficult. While the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) family adjusts to the new town, Alice feels like an outcast at school. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) meets Beth, a Jewish neighbor, and the two become fast friends. Beth leaves for summer camp and Alice goes to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grandparents. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is bored, but reunites with an old friend, Jill, who invites Alice to a party. At the party, Alice unwittingly drops LSD and experiences a fantastic drug trip. Though curious, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) vows not to do drugs again. Alice happily experiments with more drugs and loses her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) virginity while on acid. Roger and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) parents show up unexpectedly to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grandfather, who has had a small heart attack. Alice is enthralled with Roger but feels guilty about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) drug use and loss of virginity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) doesn't know to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) can talk about drugs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is worried that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) may be pregnant. Alice goes home and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) family accepts her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) warmly. Unable to sleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) receives powerful tranquilizers from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) doctor. Beth returns from camp, but Alice finds that Beth has changed. In a boutique, Alice meets Chris, a hip girl. Alice's parents worry about Alice's <div class="bookquote">``hippie''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>appearance. Alice and Chris are both dissatisfied with the establishment and their own families. Alice gets a job working with Chris, and the two become best friends. At school, they use drugs and are popular. Chris's friend Richie, a college boy, turns Alice on to marijuana. To make more money for drugs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and Chris sell drugs and do whatever they can to help Richie and Ted -LRB-Chris's boyfriend and Richie's roommate-RRB-. Alice and Chris discover Richie and Ted having sex with each other and flee to San Francisco. Alice turns Richie in to the police and vows to stay clean with Chris. They move into a cramped apartment. Chris secures a job in a boutique with a glamorous older woman, Sheila, and Alice gets one with a custom jeweler. Sheila invites the girls to a party at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) house. At Sheila's swanky party, the girls use drugs again. They continue to party with Sheila until one night, when trying heroin, Alice realizes that Sheila and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) boyfriend have been raping and brutalizing them. The girls kick their drug lifestyle. They find a new apartment in Berkeley and open a jewelry shop there, which turns into a hangout for the neighborhood kids. Alice misses her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) returns home for Christmas, and the holiday spirit and family camaraderie revive her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) begins school and resists drug advances from old friends, though some are aggressive. Chris smokes marijuana with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and Alice goes back on drugs. The police raid Chris's house while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and Alice use drugs. The girls are put on probation, and Alice will be sent to a psychiatrist. Alice continues to do drugs without her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) family's knowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hitchhikes to Denver -LRB-recording her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) diary entries on scraps of paper without dates-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) travels to Oregon with other drug users but soon loses them. A janitor directs her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to a mission similar to the Salvation Army. Alice is cleaned up and meets a young sufferer of lifelong sexual abuse, Doris, who lets her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stay at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) apartment. They get sick from malnourishment and hitchhike to Southern California, where Alice takes more drugs, even prostituting herself for them. Alice talks with a priest about teen runaways, and he (<font color='blue'><b>teen</b></font>) calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) parents. They want her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to come home. In the city, Alice meets several other runaways and talks to them about why they left home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) imagines she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) may go into child guidance or psychology some day to help out others, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) vows to quit drugs. Alice comes home and is excited to renew her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) family. Alice loses consciousness and drifts off into a reverie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thinks is either a flashback -LRB-caused by LSD residue in the spinal cavity-RRB- or a schizophrenic episode. Otherwise, Alice is happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) family and with herself, except for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) social isolation: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) can't hang out with drug users, and <div class="bookquote">``straight''  (<font color='red'><b>drug users</b></font>)</div>kids don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) around. Alice's grandfather dies in a coma from a stroke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) agonizes over the thought of worms and maggots eating his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) dead body underground. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) relationship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father matures. Someone plants a joint in Alice's purse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) leaves school to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) office. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) consoles her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and gets her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) permission to study at the university library. Alice meets a freshman at the university library, Joel; his (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) father is dead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) mother is a factory worker, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) works as a janitor to pay for school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) and Alice get to know each other better, as does her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fantasizes about marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>). Pressure to use drugs at school intensifies, as the kids harass Alice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) family. Alice's grandmother dies. After the funeral, Joel has a long talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) about death that makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feel better, and they kiss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) opens up to Joel about some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) past, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) is kind and supportive. Alice writes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) undated diary from a hospital. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is unsure how she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has ended up here and can only think of the worms she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thinks are eating her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) alive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has chewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fingers to the bone, and clawed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face and body. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father says that someone dosed with LSD the chocolate-covered peanuts Alice was eating while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was baby-sitting. Alice finds out she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is being sent to an insane asylum. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that when her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) case was brought before a juvenile court and that Jan and another girl testified that Alice had still been on drugs and was selling them. Alice registers at the State Mental Hospital. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is frightened by the ugly building and by the inmates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) meets a little thirteen-year-old girl, Babbie, a former prostitute and drug user with a history of sexual abuse. Life in the asylum drains Alice. A visit from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) parents brings a warm letter from Joel. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) father reports that Jan has retracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) statement, and they're trying to get the other girl to do the same to free Alice. Alice returns home and is happy to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) family. The family takes a vacation together, and when they return, Alice is invited swimming by Fawn, a <div class="bookquote">``straight''  (<font color='red'><b>Fawn</b></font>)</div>kid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has a fun time with Fawn's friends and hopes that they haven't heard stories about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Joel makes a surprise visit and gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a friendship ring, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) vows to wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) whole life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is worried about starting school again but feels stronger with the support of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) new friends and Joel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) comments that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) no longer needs a diary, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now has people in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) can communicate. In the epilogue, we are told that Alice died three weeks later of an overdose--whether it was premeditated or accidental remains unclear--and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was one of thousands of drug deaths that year.
