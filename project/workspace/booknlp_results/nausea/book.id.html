He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) is not sure what exactly is wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>), often doubting if there is any need to keep a diary at all. Nevertheless, a few days later, he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) is so overcome with what he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) calls the Nausea, that he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) begins to furiously list every insignificant fact, detail, feeling, and impression occurring both inside himself and the outside world. He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) holds a stone, looks at a glass of beer, and tries to touch a soggy piece of paper in the street--each time sensing a worrisome and overwhelming presence. For the past ten years, Roquentin has been researching the Marquis de Rollebon, a French aristocrat who lived during the French Revolution. Rollebon was originally from Bouville so Roquentin moved there to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) research and write a book about him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). But his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) feelings of Nausea soon extend to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) research. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) looks in a mirror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is not sure if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own face or Rollebon's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) soon loses interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) work, realizing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) can never understand Rollebon as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) were still alive. Roquentin feels constrained by the past, choosing instead to live in the present. Roquentin begins to understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) feelings of Nausea have something to do with the question of existence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had been using Rollebon and the past in general to justify his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own existence. Roquentin defiantly asserts his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own existence, claiming that everyone else he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) sees is afraid to acknowledge that they exist. Focusing on the existence of objects and people, Roquentin discovers that <div class="bookquote">``existence precedes essence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roquentin</b></font>)</div>Looking at the root of a chestnut tree, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) realizes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) perception of the root's essence, or its physical characteristics, in fact hides the truth of the object's existence. The comforting facade of tastes, colors, smells, weight, and appearance are thus the creation of the observer. Looking through the essence of objects, Roquentin is confronted with the bare existence of things, and thus the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) Nausea. Roquentin visits his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) ex-lover Anny in Paris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had hoped that they would get back together, but is disappointed to find that they do not communicate very well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) vainly attempts to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) feelings of Nausea to Anny, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) does not understand. They part, knowing that they will never see each other again. Back in Bouville, Roquentin resolves to free himself from the past by embracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) existence in the present. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) tries to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) views to the Self-Taught Man, a lonely cafe acquaintance, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) cannot persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) that human love is just an essence, and that there is no purpose to existence, only <div class="bookquote">``nothingness.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) despair and abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) research, Roquentin chooses to move to Paris and write a novel.
