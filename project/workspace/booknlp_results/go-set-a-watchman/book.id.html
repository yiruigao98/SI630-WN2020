Jean Louise's father, Atticus Finch, is a prominent lawyer in town. Over the past few years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) has been suffering from arthritis, so his (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) sister, Alexandra Finch, now lives with him (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>). Jean Louise's older brother, Jem, died of a sudden heart condition a few years ago when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was only in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) early twenties. Jean Louise reconnects with Henry <div class="bookquote">``Hank''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>Clinton, who works in Atticus's law office. Henry was Jem's childhood best friend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and Jean Louise have been a couple for several years, but Jean Louise won't commit to marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Henry and Jean Louise visit Jean Louise's ancestral home, where they go swimming late at night. Jean Louise has flashbacks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) childhood with Jem and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) childhood friend, Dill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) fondly remembers re-enacting scenes from both fiction and reality with them. On the way back to town, a car full of black people passes them, going extremely fast, and Henry says that the black people have enough money to buy cars, but they don't have licenses and insurance. The next morning, Henry and Jean Louise's trip has made the rounds of the town gossip, which scandalizes Alexandra, but Jean Louise and Atticus are mildly amused. The whole family goes to church, where the music director tries to conduct a hymn in a different rhythm, but the townspeople sing it exactly the way they've always been singing it. After church, Atticus and Henry leave for a political meeting. Jean Louise finds a racist pamphlet titled <div class="bookquote">``The Black Plague''  (<font color='red'><b>Jean Louise</b></font>)</div>among Atticus's papers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) is horrified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) follows Atticus and Henry to their meeting, which turns out to be a gathering of the Maycomb County Citizen's Council, an organization promoting segregation and white supremacy. Nearly all the men in town are there, except Uncle Jack. The meeting is in the courthouse, and Jean Louise watches it from the same place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) and Jem sat as children to watch their father defend a black man who was on trial for rape. Then, Jean Louise was proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) father for standing up for what was right. Now, Jean Louise is disgusted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) father can be part of something so racist. Jean Louise leaves and walks around town, feeling sickened and betrayed, and has flashbacks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) youth, in which Atticus had always been her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) rock-solid moral compass. Jean Louise also remembers Calpurnia, the black woman who had served as the Finches' cook and a surrogate mother figure. The next morning, the family learns that Calpurnia's grandson had killed a pedestrian while speeding in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) car. Atticus takes the case, but only to stop the NAACP from coming to town and getting involved. Jean Louise visits Calpurnia, but Calpurnia treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) politely and coldly, without a hint of affection. Jean Louise has lunch with Uncle Jack and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) how Atticus could allow himself to be involved with a racist organization. Uncle Jack tries to explain that Atticus himself isn't necessarily a racist, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Atticus</b></font>) has to maintain appearances to the townspeople, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Atticus</b></font>) has to understand what they're up to -LRB-think <div class="bookquote">``Know thy enemy'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-RRB-. Uncle Jack is trying to plant the seed for Jean Louise to come to a conclusion, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) doesn't quite grasp what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s trying to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) understand. Jean Louise has a flashback to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) adolescence, recalling the time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) and Henry went together to a dance. This was the first time that Jean Louise really began to feel like she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) was becoming a woman, not just a child or Jem's little sister. The next day, the school principal found Jean Louise's false bosoms, which had fallen during the night. Henry comes up with a scheme to save the day, and it later turns out that Atticus had had the idea but had planted the seed of it in Henry's mind. Jean Louise has coffee with Henry and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) can never marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) yells at Henry for being a hypocrite, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) realizes that Atticus is standing right there. Jean Louise and Atticus go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Atticus</b></font>) office, and they begin to argue about Brown v. Board of Education and the NAACP. Jean Louise is in favor of states' rights, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) doesn't entirely agree with the Supreme Court, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) argues that they had to do what was right morally, even if it might not have been the right decision politically. Atticus's positions seem to go against everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Atticus</b></font>) had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) lashes out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Atticus</b></font>). Jean Louise goes home in a blinding rage to pack her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) things and leave. Uncle Jack comes over and slaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>). The slap shocks Jean Louise thoroughly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) snaps out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) rage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) explains that Atticus is not an idol, but rather, is thoroughly human, and that Jean Louise has to rely on herself to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) own moral anchor. Jean Louise is chastened and decides to remain in Maycomb. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) won't marry Henry. Jean Louise returns to the office to apologize to Atticus, but Atticus says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Atticus</b></font>) is proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>).
