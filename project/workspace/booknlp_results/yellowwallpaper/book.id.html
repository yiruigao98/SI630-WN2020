grounds her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) husband has taken for their summer vacation. She (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) describes it in
romantic terms as an aristocratic estate or even a haunted house and wonders how
they were able to afford it, and why the house had been empty for so long. Her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)
feeling that there is <div class="bookquote">``something queer''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>about the situation leads her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) into a
discussion of her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) illness--she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) is suffering from <div class="bookquote">``nervous depression'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and of her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)
marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) complains that her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) husband John, who is also her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) doctor, belittles
both her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) illness and her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) thoughts and concerns in general. She (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) contrasts his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
practical, rationalistic manner with her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) own imaginative, sensitive ways. Her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)
treatment requires that she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) do almost nothing active, and she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) is especially
forbidden from working and writing. She (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) feels that activity, freedom, and
interesting work would help her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) condition and reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) has begun her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) secret
journal in order to <div class="bookquote">``relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>In an attempt to do so, the narrator begins
describing the house. Her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) description is mostly positive, but disturbing elements
such as the <div class="bookquote">``rings and things''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>in the bedroom walls, and the bars on the windows,
keep showing up. She (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) is particularly disturbed by the yellow wallpaper in the
bedroom, with its strange, formless pattern, and describes it as <div class="bookquote">``revolting.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Soon,
however, her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) thoughts are interrupted by John's approach, and she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) is forced to stop
writing. As the first few weeks of the summer pass, the narrator becomes good at hiding
her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) journal, and thus hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) true thoughts from John. She (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) continues to long for
more stimulating company and activity, and she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) complains again about John's
patronizing, controlling ways--although she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) immediately returns to the wallpaper,
which begins to seem not only ugly, but oddly menacing. She (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) mentions that John is
worried about her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) becoming fixated on it, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has even refused to repaper
the room so as not to give in to her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) neurotic worries. The narrator's imagination,
however, has been aroused. She (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) mentions that she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) enjoys picturing people on the
walkways around the house and that John always discourages such fantasies. She (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) also
thinks back to her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) childhood, when she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) was able to work herself into a terror by
imagining things in the dark. As she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) describes the bedroom, which she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) says must have
been a nursery for young children, she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) points out that the paper is torn off the
wall in spots, there are scratches and gouges in the floor, and the furniture is
heavy and fixed in place. Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) begins to see a strange sub-pattern behind the
main design of the wallpaper, her (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) writing is interrupted again, this time by John's
sister, Jennie, who is acting as housekeeper and nurse for the narrator. As the Fourth of July passes, the narrator reports that her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) family has just
visited, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) more tired than ever. John threatens to send her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) to Weir
Mitchell, the real-life physician under whose care Gilman had a nervous breakdown.
The narrator is alone most of the time and says that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) has become almost fond of
the wallpaper and that attempting to figure out its pattern has become her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) primary
entertainment. As her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) obsession grows, the sub-pattern of the wallpaper becomes
clearer. It begins to resemble a woman <div class="bookquote">``stooping down and creeping''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>behind the main
pattern, which looks like the bars of a cage. Whenever the narrator tries to discuss
leaving the house, John makes light of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) concerns, effectively silencing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Each
time he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) does so, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) disgusted fascination with the paper grows. Soon the wallpaper dominates the narrator's imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) becomes
possessive and secretive, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) interest in the paper and making sure no one
else examines it so that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can <div class="bookquote">``find it out''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own. At one point, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
startles Jennie, who had been touching the wallpaper and who mentions that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
found yellow stains on their clothes. Mistaking the narrator's fixation for
tranquility, John thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is improving. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleeps less and less and is
convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can smell the paper all over the house, even outside. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
discovers a strange smudge mark on the paper, running all around the room, as if it
had been rubbed by someone crawling against the wall. The sub-pattern now clearly resembles a woman who is trying to get out from
behind the main pattern. The narrator sees her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shaking the bars at night and
creeping around during the day, when the woman is able to escape briefly. The
narrator mentions that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), too, creeps around at times. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suspects that John and
Jennie are aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) obsession, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) resolves to destroy the paper once and
for all, peeling much of it off during the night. The next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) manages to be
alone and goes into something of a frenzy, biting and tearing at the paper in order
to free the trapped woman, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sees struggling from inside the pattern. By the end, the narrator is hopelessly insane, convinced that there are many
creeping women around and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself has come out of the wallpaper--that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
herself is the trapped woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) creeps endlessly around the room, smudging the
wallpaper as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goes. When John breaks into the locked room and sees the full
horror of the situation, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) faints in the doorway, so that the narrator has <div class="bookquote">``to
creep over him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) every time!''
