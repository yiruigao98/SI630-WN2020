Antiochus has kept suitors from marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) by requiring that they answer a riddle correctly or die. Pericles, Prince of Tyre, tries his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hand at the riddle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is successful, but discovers that its answer reveals the incestuous relationship between father and daughter. Pericles doesn't reveal the truth, and Antiochus gives him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) forty days before his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) death sentence. But Pericles is sure Antiochus will want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dead for knowing the truth, so he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) flees back to Tyre. Antiochus sends an assassin after him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). In Tyre, Pericles worries that Antiochus will take some form of revenge, whether a military attack or an underhanded assassination attempt. Filled with melancholy, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) takes the advice of Helicanus, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) councilor, to travel for a while until Antiochus is no longer after him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Pericles first goes to Tarsus, where king Cleon and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife Dionyza bemoan the famine that has beset their nation. Pericles arrives with corn and saves them. But soon a letter from Helicanus calls Pericles back to Tyre, so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sets off. On the way home Pericles is shipwrecked in a storm in Pentapolis. Some fishermen tell him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) about king Simonides's daughter, a lovely girl who will be married to whoever wins a jousting contest the following day. Pericles determines to enter the contest. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is the rustiest armor, Pericles wins the tournament, and dines with Simonides and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) daughter Thaisa, both of whom are very impressed with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). Meanwhile in Tyre, Helicanus reveals that Antiochus and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) daughter have been burnt to death by fire from heaven, so Pericles can return. Other citizens want to crown Helicanus as king, but Helicanus insists they wait to see if Pericles returns. In Pentapolis, Pericles hears of recent events and determines to go back to Tyre. On board a boat with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife and Lychordia, a nurse, they come upon a great storm, during which Thaisa dies in childbirth. The shipmaster insists the body be thrown overboard, or the storm won't stop, and Pericles complies. Thaisa's body is put in a chest, which washes up in Ephesus, where it is brought to the attention of Cerimon, a generous doctor. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) discovers that Thaisa is not dead, and revives her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>). Pericles lands in Tarsus and hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) child, Marina, to Cleon and Dionyza, since he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) thinks it won't survive the journey to Tyre. Then times passes; Pericles is king of Tyre, Thaisa becomes a priestess for Diana, and Marina grows up. But Dionyza is jealous of Marina, who takes all the attention away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) own daughter who is of similar age. Dionyza plots to have Leonine murder Marina, but at the last moment, pirates seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Marina</b></font>), and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marina</b></font>) to Myteline on Lesbos to sell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marina</b></font>) as a prostitute. Sold to a brothel run by Pander and Bawd, Marina refuses to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marina</b></font>) honor, despite the many men who come wanting to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Marina</b></font>) virginity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marina</b></font>) manages to convince the men who come to the brothel that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marina</b></font>) honor is sacred, and they leave seeking virtue in their own lives. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Marina</b></font>) gets work in a reputable house, educating girls. Meanwhile, Pericles goes on a trip to Tarsus to reunite with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) daughter, but Cleon and Dionyza tell him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has died, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) the monument they have ordered built in order to erase their complicity in the matter. Pericles is distraught, and sets to the seas again. Pericles and his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) crew arrive in Myteline, and Lysimachus goes out to meet the ships. Helicanus explains that Pericles has not spoken in three months, and Lysimachus says he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) knows someone in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) city who may be able to make him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) talk. Marina is brought to the ship, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tells Pericles that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own sufferings must match his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) asks her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) birth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) says her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) name is Marina. Startled, Pericles asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Marina</b></font>) to continue, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) surprise finds that everything Marina says matches the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own lost Marina. They are reunited, but Pericles is exhausted, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sleep the goddess Diana tells him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) temple in Ephesus and tell of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) experiences. When he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wakes, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) promises Marina to Lysimachus, and they set off for Ephesus. In Ephesus, Thaisa is a priestess at the temple where Pericles tells his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) story. When she (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) realizes Pericles is her (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) lost husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) faints, and Cerimon explains that she (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) is Thaisa. The whole family is reunited, and overjoyed. Gower returns to offer a conclusion, noting that we have seen evil punished -LRB-Antiochus and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gower</b></font>) daughter have died, and when the people of Tarsus discovered Cleon's evil, they revolted and killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gower</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gower</b></font>) wife in a palace fire-RRB-, but that we have met a variety of good people along the way, such as loyal Helicanus and charitable Cerimon. Pericles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gower</b></font>) family have endured the vagaries of fortune, and through it all remained virtuous, so in the end they were rewarded with the joy of being reunited.
