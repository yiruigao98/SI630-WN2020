Maggie frustrates her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) superficial mother with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) unconventional dark coloring and unnatural activeness and intelligence. Maggie's father often takes Maggie's side, but it is Maggie's older brother Tom upon whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is emotionally dependent. Maggie's greatest happiness is Tom's affection, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) disapproval creates dramatic despair in Maggie, whose view of the world, as all children's, lacks perspective. Though Tom is less studious than Maggie appears to be, Mr. Tulliver decides to pay for Tom to have additional education rather than have him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) take over the mill. This decision provokes a family quarrel between Mr. Tulliver and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) wife's sisters, the Dodsons. Mr. Tulliver is frustrated by the snobbish contrariness of the Dodsons, led by Mrs. Tulliver's sister Mrs. Glegg, and vows to repay money that Mrs. Glegg had lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), thereby weakening her (<font color='blue'><b>Glegg</b></font>) hold on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) has lent almost an equal sum to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband, the Mosses, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) feels affectionately toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>) sister and decides not to ask for money back, which they cannot pay. Mr. Stelling, a clergyman, takes Tom on as a student, and Maggie visits him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at school several times. On one of these visits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) befriends Mr. Stelling's other student--the sensitive, crippled Philip Wakem, son of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's enemy, Lawyer Wakem. Maggie herself is sent to school along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cousin, Lucy, but is called home when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is thirteen when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father finally loses his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) extended lawsuit with Lawyer Wakem over the use of the river Floss. Mr. Tulliver is rendered bankrupt and ill. Tom returns home as well to support the family, as the Dodson's offer little help. The mill itself is up for auction, and Lawyer Wakem, based on an idea inadvertently furnished to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) by Mrs. Tulliver, buys Dorlcote Mill and retains Mr. Tulliver as a manager in an act of humiliating patronage. Even after Mr. Tulliver's recovery, the atmosphere at the Tullivers' is grim. One bright spot is the return of Bob Jakin, a childhood friend of Tom's, into Tom and Maggie's life. Bob, a trader, kindly buys books for Maggie and one of them--Thomas a Kempis's The Imitation of Christ--influences a spiritual awakening in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that leads to many months of pious self-denial. It is only after Maggie reencounters Philip Wakem on one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) walks in the woods that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is persuaded to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) martyrish dullness in favor of the richness of literature and human interaction. Philip and Maggie meet clandestinely for a year, since Maggie's father would be hurt by their friendship as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has sworn to hold Lawyer Wakem as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wakem</b></font>) life-long enemy. Philip finally confesses to Maggie that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and Maggie, at first surprised, says she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) back. Soon thereafter, Tom discovers their meetings, cruelly upbraids Philip, and makes Maggie swear not to see Philip again. On a business venture with Bob Jakin, Tom has amassed enough money to pay off Mr. Tulliver's debts to the family's surprise and relief. On the way home from the official repayment of the debts, Mr. Tulliver meets Lawyer Wakem and attacks him (<font color='blue'><b>Tulliver</b></font>), but then Mr. Tulliver falls ill himself and dies the next day. Several years later, Maggie has been teaching in another village. Now a tall, striking woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) returns to St. Ogg's to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cousin Lucy, who has taken in Mrs. Tulliver. Lucy has a handsome and rich suitor named Stephen Guest, and they are friends with Philip Wakem. Maggie asks Tom for permission to see Philip, which Tom grudgingly gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Maggie and Philip renew their close friendship, and Maggie would consider marriage to Philip, if only his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father approved. Lucy realizes that Tom wishes to purchase back Dorlcote Mill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asks Philip to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father, Lawyer Wakem. Philip speaks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father about selling the mill and about his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) love for Maggie, and Lawyer Wakem is eventually responsive to both propositions. Meanwhile, however, Stephen and Maggie have gradually become helplessly attracted to each other, against both of their expectations and wishes. Maggie plans for their attraction to come to nothing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) will take another teaching post away from St. Ogg's soon. Stephen pursues her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), though, and Philip quickly becomes aware of the situation. Feeling ill and jealous, Philip cancels a boat- ride with Maggie and Lucy, sending Stephen instead. As Lucy has proceeded down river, meaning to leave Philip and Maggie alone, Stephen and Maggie find themselves inadvertently alone together. Stephen rows Maggie past their planned meeting point with Lucy and begs her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). The weather changes and they are far down the river. Maggie complacently boards a larger boat with Philip, which is headed for Mudport. They sleep over night on the boat's deck and when they reach Mudport, Maggie holds firm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) decision to part with Stephen and return to St. Ogg's. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) return to St. Ogg's, Maggie is treated in town as a fallen woman and a social outcast. Tom, now back in Dorlcote Mill, renounces her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and Maggie, accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother, goes to lodge with Bob Jakin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakin</b></font>) wife. Despite public knowledge of Stephen's letter, which acknowledges all the blame upon himself, Maggie is befriended only by the Jakins and the clergyman Dr. Kenn. Lucy, who has been prostrate with grief, becomes well again and secretly visits Maggie to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) forgiveness. Philip, as well, sends a letter of forgiveness and faithfulness. Stephen sends Maggie a letter renewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) pleas for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand in marriage and protesting the pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). Maggie vows to bear the burden of the pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has caused others and must endure herself until death but wonders to herself how long this trial, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life, will be. At this moment, water begins rushing under the Jakin's door from the nearby river Floss, which is flooding. Maggie wakes the Jakins' and takes one of their boats, rowing it down river in a feat of miraculous strength toward Dorlcote Mill. Maggie rescues Tom, who is trapped in the house, and they row down river towards Lucy. Before they can reach Lucy's house, the boat is capsized by debris in the river, and Maggie and Tom drown in each other's arms. Years go by and Philip, and Stephen and Lucy together, visit the grave.
