the narrator joins a company of twenty-nine pilgrims. The pilgrims,
like the narrator, are traveling to the shrine of the martyr Saint
Thomas Becket in Canterbury. The narrator gives a descriptive account
of twenty-seven of these pilgrims, including a Knight, Squire, Yeoman, Prioress,
Monk, Friar, Merchant, Clerk, Man of Law, Franklin, Haberdasher,
Carpenter, Weaver, Dyer, Tapestry-Weaver, Cook, Shipman, Physician,
Wife, Parson, Plowman, Miller, Manciple, Reeve, Summoner, Pardoner,
and Host. -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Reeve</b></font>) does not describe the Second Nun or the Nun's Priest,
although both characters appear later in the book.-RRB- The Host, whose
name, we find out in the Prologue to the Cook's Tale, is Harry Bailey,
suggests that the group ride together and entertain one
another with stories. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) decides that each pilgrim will tell two
stories on the way to Canterbury and two on the way back. Whomever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) judges to be the best storyteller will receive a meal at Bailey's
tavern, courtesy of the other pilgrims. The pilgrims draw lots and
determine that the Knight will tell the first tale. Theseus, duke of Athens, imprisons Arcite and Palamon,
two knights from Thebes -LRB-another city in ancient Greece-RRB-. From their prison,
the knights see and fall in love with Theseus's sister-in-law, Emelye.
Through the intervention of a friend, Arcite is freed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is
banished from Athens. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) returns in disguise and becomes a page in
Emelye's chamber. Palamon escapes from prison, and the two meet
and fight over Emelye. Theseus apprehends them and arranges a tournament
between the two knights and their allies, with Emelye as the prize.
Arcite wins, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) is accidentally thrown from his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) horse and dies.
Palamon then marries Emelye. The Host asks the Monk to tell the next tale, but the
drunken Miller interrupts and insists that his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) tale should be the
next. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) tells the story of an impoverished student named Nicholas,
who persuades his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) landlord's sexy young wife, Alisoun, to spend
the night with him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) convinces his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) landlord, a carpenter named
John, that the second flood is coming, and tricks him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) into spending
the night in a tub hanging from the ceiling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) barn. Absolon,
a young parish clerk who is also in love with Alisoun, appears outside
the window of the room where Nicholas and Alisoun lie together.
When Absolon begs Alisoun for a kiss, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) sticks her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) rear end out
the window in the dark and lets him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) kiss it. Absolon runs and gets
a red-hot poker, returns to the window, and asks for another kiss;
when Nicholas sticks his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) bottom out the window and farts, Absolon
brands him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) on the buttocks. Nicholas's cries for water make the
carpenter think that the flood has come, so the carpenter cuts the
rope connecting his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) tub to the ceiling, falls down, and breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>)
arm. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) also does carpentry, the Reeve takes offense
at the Miller's tale of a stupid carpenter, and counters with his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>)
own tale of a dishonest miller. The Reeve tells the story of two
students, John and Alayn, who go to the mill to watch the miller
grind their corn, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) won't have a chance to steal any. But
the miller unties their horse, and while they chase it, he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) steals
some of the flour he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) has just ground for them. By the time the students
catch the horse, it is dark, so they spend the night in the miller's
house. That night, Alayn seduces the miller's daughter, and John
seduces his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wife. When the miller wakes up and finds out what has
happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) tries to beat the students. His (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) wife, thinking that
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband is actually one of the students, hits the miller over
the head with a staff. The students take back their stolen goods
and leave. The Cook particularly enjoys the Reeve's Tale, and offers
to tell another funny tale. The tale concerns an apprentice named
Perkyn who drinks and dances so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) is called <div class="bookquote">``Perkyn Reveler.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Finally,
Perkyn's master decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would rather his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) apprentice leave
to revel than stay home and corrupt the other servants. Perkyn arranges
to stay with a friend who loves drinking and gambling, and who has
a wife who is a prostitute. The tale breaks off, unfinished, after
fifty-eight lines. The Host reminds his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fellow pilgrims to waste no time,
because lost time cannot be regained. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asks the Man of Law to
tell the next tale. The Man of Law agrees, apologizing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) cannot
tell any suitable tale that Chaucer has not already told--Chaucer
may be unskilled as a poet, says the Man of Law, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) has told
more stories of lovers than Ovid, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) doesn't print tales of
incest as John Gower does -LRB-Gower was a contemporary of Chaucer-RRB-.
In the Prologue to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tale, the Man of Law laments the miseries
of poverty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) then remarks how fortunate merchants are, and says
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) tale is one told to him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) by a merchant. In the tale, the Muslim sultan of Syria converts his (<font color='blue'><b>sultan</b></font>) entire
sultanate -LRB-including himself-RRB- to Christianity in order to persuade
the emperor of Rome to give him (<font color='blue'><b>sultan</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>sultan</b></font>) daughter, Custance, in marriage. The
sultan's mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) attendants remain secretly faithful to Islam.
The mother tells her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wishes to hold a banquet for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and
all the Christians. At the banquet, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) massacres her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son and all the
Christians except for Custance, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sets adrift in a rudderless
ship. After years of floating, Custance runs ashore in Northumberland,
where a constable and his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) wife, Hermengyld, offer her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shelter. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
converts them to Christianity. One night, Satan makes a young knight sneak into Hermengyld's chamber
and murder Hermengyld. He (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) places the bloody knife next to Custance,
who sleeps in the same chamber. When the constable returns home,
accompanied by Alla, the king of Northumberland, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) finds his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) slain
wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) tells Alla the story of how Custance was found, and Alla
begins to pity the girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) decides to look more deeply into the
murder. Just as the knight who murdered Hermengyld is swearing that
Custance is the true murderer, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) is struck down and his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) eyes burst
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) face, proving his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) guilt to Alla and the crowd. The knight
is executed, Alla and many others convert to Christianity, and Custance
and Alla marry. While Alla is away in Scotland, Custance gives birth to
a boy named Mauricius. Alla's mother, Donegild, intercepts a letter
from Custance to Alla and substitutes a counterfeit one that claims
that the child is disfigured and bewitched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alla</b></font>) then intercepts
Alla's reply, which claims that the child should be kept and loved
no matter how malformed. Donegild substitutes a letter saying that Custance
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alla</b></font>) son are banished and should be sent away on the same ship
on which Custance arrived. Alla returns home, finds out what has
happened, and kills Donegild. After many adventures at sea, including an attempted rape, Custance
ends up back in Rome, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alla</b></font>) reunites with Alla, who has made
a pilgrimage there to atone for killing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alla</b></font>) also reunites
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alla</b></font>) father, the emperor. Alla and Custance return to England,
but Alla dies after a year, so Custance returns, once more, to Rome.
Mauricius becomes the next Roman emperor. Following the Man of Law's Tale, the Host asks the Parson
to tell the next tale, but the Parson reproaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) for swearing,
and they fall to bickering. The Wife of Bath gives a lengthy account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) feelings
about marriage. Quoting from the Bible, the Wife argues against
those who believe it is wrong to marry more than once, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) explains
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) dominated and controlled each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) five husbands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>)
married her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) fifth husband, Jankyn, for love instead of money. After
the Wife has rambled on for a while, the Friar butts in to complain
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) is taking too long, and the Summoner retorts that friars
are like flies, always meddling. The Friar promises to tell a tale
about a summoner, and the Summoner promises to tell a tale about
a friar. The Host cries for everyone to quiet down and allow the
Wife to commence her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) tale. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) tale, a young knight of King Arthur's court rapes
a maiden; to atone for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) crime, Arthur's queen sends him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on a
quest to discover what women want most. An ugly old woman promises
the knight that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) the secret if he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) promises to do
whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants for saving his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) agrees, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tells
him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) women want control of their husbands and their own lives. They
go together to Arthur's queen, and the old woman's answer turns
out to be correct. The old woman then tells the knight that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) must
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). When the knight confesses later that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is repulsed by
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appearance, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) a choice: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can either be ugly and
faithful, or beautiful and unfaithful. The knight tells her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to make
the choice herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rewards him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) for giving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) control of
the marriage by rendering herself both beautiful and faithful. The Friar speaks approvingly of the Wife of Bath's Tale,
and offers to lighten things up for the company by telling a funny
story about a lecherous summoner. The Summoner does not object,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>) promises to pay the Friar back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>) own tale. The Friar
tells of an archdeacon who carries out the law without mercy, especially
to lechers. The archdeacon has a summoner who has a network of spies
working for him (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>), to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>) know who has been lecherous. The summoner
extorts money from those he (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>)'s sent to summon, charging them more
money than he (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>) should for penance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>) tries to serve a summons on
a yeoman who is actually a devil in disguise. After comparing notes
on their treachery and extortion, the devil vanishes, but when the
summoner tries to prosecute an old wealthy widow unfairly, the widow
cries out that the summoner should be taken to hell. The devil follows
the woman's instructions and drags the summoner off to hell. The Summoner, furious at the Friar's Tale, asks the company
to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>) tell the next tale. First, he (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>) tells the company that
there is little difference between friars and fiends, and that when
an angel took a friar down to hell to show him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) the torments there,
the friar asked why there were no friars in hell; the angel then
pulled up Satan's tail and 20,000 friars
came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) ass. In the Summoner's Tale, a friar begs for money from a
dying man named Thomas and his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) wife, who have recently lost their
child. The friar shamelessly exploits the couple's misfortunes to
extract money from them, so Thomas tells the friar that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) is sitting
on something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) will bequeath to the friars. The friar reaches
for his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) bequest, and Thomas lets out an enormous fart. The friar
complains to the lord of the manor, whose squire promises to divide
the fart evenly among all the friars. The Host asks the Clerk to cheer up and tell a merry tale,
and the Clerk agrees to tell a tale by the Italian poet Petrarch.
Griselde is a hardworking peasant who marries into the aristocracy.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clerk</b></font>) husband tests her (<font color='blue'><b>Clerk</b></font>) fortitude in several ways, including pretending
to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Clerk</b></font>) children and divorcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clerk</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) punishes her (<font color='blue'><b>Clerk</b></font>)
one final time by forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clerk</b></font>) to prepare for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wedding to a new
wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clerk</b></font>) does all this dutifully, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clerk</b></font>) husband tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Clerk</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clerk</b></font>)
has always been and will always be his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife -LRB-the divorce was a fraud-RRB-,
and they live happily ever after. The Merchant reflects on the great difference between
the patient Griselde of the Clerk's Tale and the horrible shrew
he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) has been married to for the past two months. The Host asks him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
to tell a story of the evils of marriage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) complies. Against
the advice of his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) friends, an old knight named January marries May,
a beautiful young woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is less than impressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) enthusiastic
sexual efforts, and conspires to cheat on him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) squire, Damien. When
blind January takes May into his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) garden to copulate with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants to eat a pear, and he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) helps her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up into the
pear tree, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has sex with Damien. Pluto, the king of the
faeries, restores January's sight, but May, caught in the act, assures
him (<font color='blue'><b>Damien</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Damien</b></font>) must still be blind. The Host prays to God to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
from marrying a wife like the one the Merchant describes. The Host calls upon the Squire to say something about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) favorite subject, love, and the Squire willingly complies. King
Cambyuskan of the Mongol Empire is visited on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) birthday by a
knight bearing gifts from the king of Arabia and India. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) gives
Cambyuskan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) daughter Canacee a magic brass horse, a magic
mirror, a magic ring that gives Canacee the ability to understand
the language of birds, and a sword with the power to cure any wound
it creates. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) rescues a dying female falcon that narrates how
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) consort abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) for the love of another. The Squire's
Tale is either unfinished by Chaucer or is meant to be interrupted
by the Franklin, who interjects that he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) wishes his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) own son were
as eloquent as the Squire. The Host expresses annoyance at the Franklin's
interruption, and orders him (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) to begin the next tale. The Franklin says that his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) tale is a familiar Breton lay,
a folk ballad of ancient Brittany. Dorigen, the heroine, awaits
the return of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) husband, Arveragus, who has gone to England to
win honor in feats of arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) worries that the ship bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
husband home will wreck itself on the coastal rocks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) promises
Aurelius, a young man who falls in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) will
give her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) body to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clears the rocks from the coast. Aurelius
hires a student learned in magic to create the illusion that the
rocks have disappeared. Arveragus returns home and tells his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) wife
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) promise to Aurelius. Aurelius is so impressed
by Arveragus's honorable act that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) generously absolves her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of
the promise, and the magician, in turn, generously absolves Aurelius
of the money he (<font color='blue'><b>magician</b></font>) owes. Appius the judge lusts after Virginia, the beautiful daughter
of Virginius. Appius persuades a churl named Claudius to declare
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) slave, stolen from him (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) by Virginius. Appius declares that
Virginius must hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) daughter to Claudius. Virginius tells
his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) daughter that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) must die rather than suffer dishonor, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) virtuously consents to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's cutting her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) head off. Appius
sentences Virginius to death, but the Roman people, aware of Appius's
hijinks, throw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into prison, where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kills himself. The Host is dismayed by the tragic injustice of the Physician's
Tale, and asks the Pardoner to tell something merry. The other pilgrims contradict
the Host, demanding a moral tale, which the Pardoner agrees to tell
after he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eats and drinks. The Pardoner tells the company how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
cheats people out of their money by preaching that money is the
root of all evil. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tale describes three riotous youths who go
looking for Death, thinking that they can kill him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). An old man tells
them that they will find Death under a tree. Instead, they find
eight bushels of gold, which they plot to sneak into town under cover
of darkness. The youngest goes into town to fetch food and drink,
but brings back poison, hoping to have the gold all to himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
companions kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to enrich their own shares, then drink the poison
and die under the tree. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tale complete, the Pardoner offers to
sell the pilgrims pardons, and singles out the Host to come kiss
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relics. The Host infuriates the Pardoner by accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of
fraud, but the Knight persuades the two to kiss and bury their differences. The Shipman's Tale features a monk who tricks a merchant's
wife into having sex with him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) by borrowing money from the merchant, then
giving it to the wife so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can repay her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own debt to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband,
in exchange for sexual favors. When the monk sees the merchant next,
he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) returned the merchant's money to his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) wife.
The wife realizes she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has been duped, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) boldly tells her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband
to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) debt: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will repay it in bed. The Host praises
the Shipman's story, and asks the Prioress for a tale. The Prioress calls on the Virgin Mary to guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tale.
In an Asian city, a Christian school is located at the edge of a
Jewish ghetto. An angelic seven-year-old boy, a widow's son, attends
the school. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a devout Christian, and loves to sing Alma
Redemptoris -LRB-Gracious Mother of the Redeemer-RRB-. Singing
the song on his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) way through the ghetto, some Jews hire a murderer
to slit his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) throat and throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) into a latrine. The Jews refuse
to tell the widow where her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) son is, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) miraculously begins to
sing Alma Redemptoris, so the Christian people
recover his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) body, and the magistrate orders the murdering Jews to
be drawn apart by wild horses and then hanged. The Host, after teasing Chaucer the narrator about his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)
appearance, asks him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) to tell a tale. Chaucer says that he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) only knows
one tale, then launches into a parody of bad poetry--the Tale of
Sir Thopas. Sir Thopas rides about looking for an elf-queen to marry
until he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) is confronted by a giant. The narrator's doggerel continues
in this vein until the Host can bear no more and interrupts him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>).
Chaucer asks him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) can't tell his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) tale, since it is the best
he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) knows, and the Host explains that his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) rhyme isn't worth a turd.
He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) encourages Chaucer to tell a prose tale. Chaucer's second tale is the long, moral prose story of
Melibee. Melibee's house is raided by his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) foes, who beat his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife,
Prudence, and severely wound his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) daughter, Sophie, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) feet,
hands, ears, nose, and mouth. Prudence advises him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) not to rashly
pursue vengeance on his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) enemies, and he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) follows her (<font color='blue'><b>Prudence</b></font>) advice, putting
his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) foes' punishment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Prudence</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Prudence</b></font>) forgives them for the outrages
done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Prudence</b></font>), in a model of Christian forbearance and forgiveness. The Host wishes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own wife were as patient as Melibee's,
and calls upon the Monk to tell the next tale. First he (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) teases the
Monk, pointing out that the Monk is clearly no poor cloisterer.
The Monk takes it all in stride and tells a series of tragic falls,
in which noble figures are brought low: Lucifer, Adam, Sampson,
Hercules, Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Zenobia, Pedro of Castile,
and down through the ages. After seventeen noble <div class="bookquote">``falls''  (<font color='red'><b>the Monk Knight</b></font>)</div>narrated by the Monk, the
Knight interrupts, and the Host calls upon the Nun's Priest to deliver
something more lively. The Nun's Priest tells of Chanticleer the
Rooster, who is carried off by a flattering fox who tricks him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) into
closing his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) eyes and displaying his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) crowing abilities. Chanticleer
turns the tables on the fox by persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) to open his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) mouth
and brag to the barnyard about his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) feat, upon which Chanticleer
falls out of the fox's mouth and escapes. The Host praises the Nun's
Priest's Tale, adding that if the Nun's Priest were not in holy
orders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Priest</b></font>) would be as sexually potent as Chanticleer. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Nun</b></font>) Prologue, the Second Nun explains that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nun</b></font>) will
tell a saint's life, that of Saint Cecilia, for this saint set an
excellent example through her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecilia</b></font>) good works and wise teachings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cecilia</b></font>)
focuses particularly on the story of Saint Cecilia's martyrdom.
Before Cecilia's new husband, Valerian, can take her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecilia</b></font>) virginity,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecilia</b></font>) sends him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on a pilgrimage to Pope Urban, who converts him (<font color='blue'><b>Urban</b></font>) to
Christianity. An angel visits Valerian, who asks that his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) brother
Tiburce be granted the grace of Christian conversion as well. All
three--Cecilia, Tiburce, and Valerian--are put to death by the Romans. When the Second Nun's Tale is finished, the company is
overtaken by a black-clad Canon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) Yeoman, who have heard of
the pilgrims and their tales and wish to participate. The Yeoman
brags to the company about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeoman</b></font>) and the Canon create
the illusion that they are alchemists, and the Canon departs in
shame at having his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeoman</b></font>) secrets discovered. The Yeoman tells a tale
of how a canon defrauded a priest by creating the illusion of alchemy
using sleight of hand. The Host pokes fun at the Cook, riding at the back of
the company, blind drunk. The Cook is unable to honor the Host's
request that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) tell a tale, and the Manciple criticizes him (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) drunkenness. The Manciple relates the legend of a white crow,
taken from the Roman poet Ovid's Metamorphoses and
one of the tales in The Arabian Nights. In it,
Phoebus's talking white crow informs him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) wife is cheating
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>). Phoebus kills the wife, pulls out the crow's white feathers,
and curses it with blackness. As the company enters a village in the late afternoon,
the Host calls upon the Parson to give them a fable. Refusing to
tell a fictional story because it would go against the rule set
by St. Paul, the Parson delivers a lengthy treatise on the Seven
Deadly Sins, instead. Chaucer appeals to readers to credit Jesus Christ as the
inspiration for anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) book that they like, and to attribute
what they don't like to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) own ignorance and lack of ability. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
retracts and prays for forgiveness for all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) works dealing
with secular and pagan subjects, asking only to be remembered for
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) has written of saints' lives and homilies.
