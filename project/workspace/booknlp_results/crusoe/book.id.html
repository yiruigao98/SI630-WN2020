the town of York in the seventeenth century, the youngest son of
a merchant of German origin. Encouraged by his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) father to study law,
Crusoe expresses his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) wish to go to sea instead. His (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) family is against
Crusoe going out to sea, and his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) father explains that it is better
to seek a modest, secure life for oneself. Initially, Robinson is
committed to obeying his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) father, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) eventually succumbs to temptation
and embarks on a ship bound for London with a friend. When a storm
causes the near deaths of Crusoe and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) friend, the friend is dissuaded
from sea travel, but Crusoe still goes on to set himself up as merchant
on a ship leaving London. This trip is financially successful, and
Crusoe plans another, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) early profits in the care of a
friendly widow. The second voyage does not prove as fortunate: the
ship is seized by Moorish pirates, and Crusoe is enslaved to a potentate
in the North African town of Sallee. While on a fishing expedition,
he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) and a slave boy break free and sail down the African coast. A
kindly Portuguese captain picks them up, buys the slave boy from
Crusoe, and takes Crusoe to Brazil. In Brazil, Crusoe establishes
himself as a plantation owner and soon becomes successful. Eager
for slave labor and its economic advantages, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) embarks on a slave-gathering expedition
to West Africa but ends up shipwrecked off of the coast of Trinidad. Crusoe soon learns he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is the sole survivor of the expedition
and seeks shelter and food for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) returns to the wreck's
remains twelve times to salvage guns, powder, food, and other items. Onshore,
he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) finds goats he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) can graze for meat and builds himself a shelter.
He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) erects a cross that he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) inscribes with the date of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) arrival, September 1, 1659,
and makes a notch every day in order never to lose track of time.
He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) also keeps a journal of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) household activities, noting his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)
attempts to make candles, his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) lucky discovery of sprouting grain,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) construction of a cellar, among other events. In June 1660,
he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) falls ill and hallucinates that an angel visits, warning him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)
to repent. Drinking tobacco-steeped rum, Crusoe experiences a religious
illumination and realizes that God has delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) earlier
sins. After recovering, Crusoe makes a survey of the area and discovers
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is on an island. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) finds a pleasant valley abounding in grapes,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) builds a shady retreat. Crusoe begins to feel more optimistic
about being on the island, describing himself as its <div class="bookquote">``king.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
trains a pet parrot, takes a goat as a pet, and develops skills
in basket weaving, bread making, and pottery. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cuts down an enormous
cedar tree and builds a huge canoe from its trunk, but he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) discovers
that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cannot move it to the sea. After building a smaller boat,
he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) rows around the island but nearly perishes when swept away by
a powerful current. Reaching shore, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hears his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) parrot calling
his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) name and is thankful for being saved once again. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) spends several
years in peace. One day Crusoe is shocked to discover a man's footprint
on the beach. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first assumes the footprint is the devil's, then
decides it must belong to one of the cannibals said to live in the
region. Terrified, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) arms himself and remains on the lookout for
cannibals. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) also builds an underground cellar in which to herd
his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) goats at night and devises a way to cook underground. One evening
he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hears gunshots, and the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is able to see a ship wrecked
on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) coast. It is empty when he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) arrives on the scene to investigate.
Crusoe once again thanks Providence for having been saved. Soon
afterward, Crusoe discovers that the shore has been strewn with
human carnage, apparently the remains of a cannibal feast. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is
alarmed and continues to be vigilant. Later Crusoe catches sight
of thirty cannibals heading for shore with their victims. One of
the victims is killed. Another one, waiting to be slaughtered, suddenly
breaks free and runs toward Crusoe's dwelling. Crusoe protects him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>),
killing one of the pursuers and injuring the other, whom the victim
finally kills. Well-armed, Crusoe defeats most of the cannibals
onshore. The victim vows total submission to Crusoe in gratitude
for his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) liberation. Crusoe names him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) Friday, to commemorate the
day on which his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) life was saved, and takes him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) servant. Finding Friday cheerful and intelligent, Crusoe teaches
him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) some English words and some elementary Christian concepts. Friday,
in turn, explains that the cannibals are divided into distinct nations and
that they only eat their enemies. Friday also informs Crusoe that the
cannibals saved the men from the shipwreck Crusoe witnessed earlier,
and that those men, Spaniards, are living nearby. Friday expresses
a longing to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) people, and Crusoe is upset at the prospect
of losing Friday. Crusoe then entertains the idea of making contact
with the Spaniards, and Friday admits that he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) would rather die than
lose Crusoe. The two build a boat to visit the cannibals' land together.
Before they have a chance to leave, they are surprised by the arrival
of twenty-one cannibals in canoes. The cannibals are holding three
victims, one of whom is in European dress. Friday and Crusoe kill
most of the cannibals and release the European, a Spaniard. Friday
is overjoyed to discover that another of the rescued victims is
his (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) father. The four men return to Crusoe's dwelling for food and
rest. Crusoe prepares to welcome them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) community permanently.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) sends Friday's father and the Spaniard out in a canoe to explore
the nearby land. Eight days later, the sight of an approaching English
ship alarms Friday. Crusoe is suspicious. Friday and Crusoe watch
as eleven men take three captives onshore in a boat. Nine of the
men explore the land, leaving two to guard the captives. Friday
and Crusoe overpower these men and release the captives, one of
whom is the captain of the ship, which has been taken in a mutiny.
Shouting to the remaining mutineers from different points, Friday
and Crusoe confuse and tire the men by making them run from place
to place. Eventually they confront the mutineers, telling them that
all may escape with their lives except the ringleader. The men surrender.
Crusoe and the captain pretend that the island is an imperial territory
and that the governor has spared their lives in order to send them
all to England to face justice. Keeping five men as hostages, Crusoe
sends the other men out to seize the ship. When the ship is brought
in, Crusoe nearly faints. On December 19, 1686,
Crusoe boards the ship to return to England. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) finds his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>)
family is deceased except for two sisters. His (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) widow friend has
kept Crusoe's money safe, and after traveling to Lisbon, Crusoe
learns from the Portuguese captain that his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) plantations in Brazil
have been highly profitable. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) arranges to sell his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) Brazilian lands.
Wary of sea travel, Crusoe attempts to return to England by land
but is threatened by bad weather and wild animals in northern Spain.
Finally arriving back in England, Crusoe receives word that the
sale of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) plantations has been completed and that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) has made
a considerable fortune. After donating a portion to the widow and
his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) sisters, Crusoe is restless and considers returning to Brazil,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is dissuaded by the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would have to become
Catholic. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) marries, and his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wife dies. Crusoe finally departs
for the East Indies as a trader in 1694.
He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) revisits his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) island, finding that the Spaniards are governing
it well and that it has become a prosperous colony.
