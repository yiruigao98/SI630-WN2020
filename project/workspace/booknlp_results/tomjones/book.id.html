with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) unmarried sister Bridget Allworthy, arrives home from a trip to
London to discover a baby boy in is bed. Allworthy undertakes to uncover the
mother and father of this foundling, and finds local woman Jenny Jones and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) tutor, Mr. Partridge, guilty. Allworthy sends Jenny away from the
county, and the poverty-stricken Partridge leaves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Partridge</b></font>) own accord. In spite of
the criticism of the parish, Allworthy decides to bring up the boy. Soon after,
Bridget marries Captain Blifil, a visitor at Allworthy's estate, and gives
birth to a son of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allworthy</b></font>) own, named Blifil. Captain Blifil regards Tom Jones
with jealousy, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) wishes his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) son to inherit all of Allworthy possessions.
While meditating on money matters, Captain Blifil falls dead of an apoplexy. The narrator skips forward twelve years. Blifil and Tom Jones have been
brought up together, but receive vastly different treatment from the other
members of the household. Allworthy is the only person who shows consistent
affection for Tom. The philosopher Square and the reverend Thwackum, the
boys' tutors, despise Tom and adore Blifil, since Tom is wild and Blifil is
pious. Tom frequently steals apples and ducks to support the family of Black
George, one of Allworthy's servants. Tom tells all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) secrets to Blifil,
who then relates these to Thwackum or Allworthy, thereby getting Tom into
trouble. The people of the parish, hearing of Tom's generosity to Black George,
begin to speak kindly of Tom while condemning Blifil for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sneakiness. Tom spends much time with Squire Western--Allworthy's
neighbor--since the Squire is impressed by Tom's sportsmanship. Sophia
Western, Squire Western's daughter, falls deeply in love with Tom. Tom has
already bestowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) affection on Molly Seagrim, the poor but feisty
daughter of Black George. When Molly becomes pregnant, Tom prevents Allworthy
from sending Molly to prison by admitting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has fathered her (<font color='blue'><b>Allworthy</b></font>) child. Tom,
at first oblivious to Sophia's charms and beauty, falls deeply in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>),
and begins to resent his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ties to Molly. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) remains with Molly out of honor.
Tom's commitment to Molly ends when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) discovers that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has been having
affairs, which means Tom is not the father of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) child and frees him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to confess
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feelings to Sophia. Allworthy falls gravely ill and summons his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) family and friends to be near him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) reads out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) will, which states that Blifil will inherit most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) estate,
although Tom is also provided for. Thwackum and Square are upset that they are
each promised only a thousand pounds. Tom experiences great emotion at
Allworthy's illness and barely leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bedside. A lawyer named Dowling
arrives and announces the sudden and unexpected death of Bridget Allworthy.
When the doctor announces that Allworthy will not die, Tom rejoices and gets
drunk on both joy and alcohol. Blifil calls Tom a <div class="bookquote">``bastard''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Jones</b></font>)</div>and Tom retaliates
by hitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Tom, after swearing eternal constancy to Sophia, encounters
Molly by chance and makes love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Mrs. Western, the aunt with whom Sophia spent much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) youth, comes to
stay at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) brother's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and the Squire fight constantly, but they unite
over Mrs. Western's plan to marry Sophia to Blifil. Mrs. Western promises not to
reveal Sophia's love for Tom as long as Sophia submits to receiving Blifil as a
suitor. Blifil thus begins his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) courtship of Sophia, and brags so much about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
progress that Allworthy believes that Sophia must love Blifil. Sophia, however,
strongly opposes the proposal, and Squire Western grows violent with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). Blifil
tells Allworthy that Tom is a rascal who cavorted drunkenly about the house, and
Allworthy banishes Tom from the county. Tom does not want to leave Sophia, but
decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) must follow the honorable path. Tom begins to wander about the countryside. In Bristol, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) happens to meet up
with Partridge, who becomes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) loyal servant. Tom also rescues a Mrs.
Waters from being robbed, and they begin an affair at a local inn. Sophia, who
has run away from Squire Western's estate to avoid marrying Blifil, stops at
this inn and discovers that Tom is having an affair with Mrs. Waters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) leaves
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) muff in Tom's bed so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) has been there. When Tom finds the
muff, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) frantically sets out in pursuit of Sophia. The Irishman Fitzpatrick
arrives at the inn searching for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wife, and Western arrives searching for
Sophia. On the way to London, Sophia rides with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) cousin Harriet, who is also
Fitzpatrick's wife. In London, Sophia stays with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lady relative Lady
Bellaston. Tom and Partridge arrive in London soon after, and they stay in the
house of Mrs. Miller and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) daughters, one of whom is named Nancy. A
young gentleman called Nightingale also inhabits the house, and Tom soon
realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Nancy are in love. Nancy falls pregnant and Tom convinces
Nightingale to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>). Lady Bellaston and Tom begin an affair, although Tom
privately, continues to pursue Sophia. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Sophia are reconciled, Tom
breaks off the relationship with Lady Bellaston by sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) a marriage
proposal that scares her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) away. Yet Lady Bellaston is still determined not to
allow Sophia and Tom's love to flourish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) encourages anoter young man, Lord
Fellamar, to rape Sophia. Soon after, Squire Western, Mrs. Western, Blifil, and Allworthy arrive in
London, and Squire Western locks Sophia in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bedroom. Mr. Fitzpatrick thinks
Tom is his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wife's lover and begins a duel with Tom. In defending himself, Tom
stabs Fitzpatrick with the sword and is thrown into jail. Partridge visits Tom
in jail with the ghastly news that Mrs. Waters is Jenny Jones, Tom's mother.
Mrs. Waters meets with Allworthy and explains that Fitzpatrick is still alive,
and has admitted to initiating the duel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allworthy</b></font>) also tells Allworthy that a lawyer
acting on behalf of an unnamed gentleman tried to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Allworthy</b></font>) to conspire
against Tom. Allworthy realizes that Blifil is this very gentleman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
decides never to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) again. Tom, however, takes pity on Blifil and
provides him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with an annuity. Mrs. Waters also reveals that Tom's mother was Bridget Allworthy. Square sends
Allworthy a letter explaining that Tom's conduct during Allworthy's illness was
honorable and compassionate. Tom is released from jail and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Allworthy are
reunited as nephew and uncle. Mrs. Miller explains to Sophia the reasons for
Tom's marriage proposal to Lady Bellaston, and Sophia is satisfied. Now that Tom
is Allworthy's heir, Squire Western eagerly encourages the marriage between Tom
and Sophia. Sophia chastises Tom for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lack of chastity, but agrees to marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). They live happily on Western's estate with two children, and shower
everyone around them with kindness and generosity.
