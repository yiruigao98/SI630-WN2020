warrior of the Umuofia clan, a lower Nigerian tribe
that is part of a consortium of nine connected villages. He is haunted by
the actions of Unoka, his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) cowardly and spendthrift father, who died
in disrepute, leaving many village debts unsettled. In response,
Okonkwo became a clansman, warrior, farmer, and family provider
extraordinaire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) has a twelve-year-old son named Nwoye whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>)
finds lazy; Okonkwo worries that Nwoye will end up a failure like
Unoka. In a settlement with a neighboring tribe, Umuofia wins
a virgin and a fifteen-year-old boy. Okonkwo takes charge of the
boy, Ikemefuna, and finds an ideal son in him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>). Nwoye likewise forms
a strong attachment to the newcomer. Despite his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) fondness for Ikemefuna
and despite the fact that the boy begins to call him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``father,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Okonkwo
does not let himself show any affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>). During the Week of Peace, Okonkwo accuses his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) youngest
wife, Ojiugo, of negligence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) severely beats her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), breaking the
peace of the sacred week. He (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) makes some sacrifices to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) repentance, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) has shocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) community irreparably. Ikemefuna stays with Okonkwo's family for three years.
Nwoye looks up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) as an older brother and, much to Okonkwo's
pleasure, develops a more masculine attitude. One day, the locusts
come to Umuofia--they will come every year for seven years before
disappearing for another generation. The village excitedly collects
them because they are good to eat when cooked. Ogbuefi Ezeudu, a respected village elder, informs Okonkwo
in private that the Oracle has said that Ikemefuna must be killed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) tells Okonkwo that because Ikemefuna calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``father,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Okonkwo
should not take part in the boy's death. Okonkwo lies to Ikemefuna,
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) that they must return him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) home village. Nwoye
bursts into tears. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) walks with the men of Umuofia, Ikemefuna
thinks about seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) mother. After several hours of
walking, some of Okonkwo's clansmen attack the boy with machetes.
Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo for help. But Okonkwo, who doesn't wish
to look weak in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) fellow tribesmen, cuts the boy down
despite the Oracle's admonishment. When Okonkwo returns
home, Nwoye deduces that his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) friend is dead. Okonkwo sinks into a depression, neither able to sleep
nor eat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) visits his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) friend Obierika and begins to feel revived
a bit. Okonkwo's daughter Ezinma falls ill, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) recovers after Okonkwo
gathers leaves for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) medicine. The death of Ogbuefi Ezeudu is announced to the surrounding villages
by means of the ekwe, a musical instrument. Okonkwo
feels guilty because the last time Ezeudu visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) was to warn
him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) against taking part in Ikemefuna's death. At Ogbuefi Ezeudu's
large and elaborate funeral, the men beat drums and fire their guns.
Tragedy compounds upon itself when Okonkwo's gun explodes and kills Ogbuefi
Ezeudu's sixteen-year-old son. Because killing a clansman is a crime against the earth
goddess, Okonkwo must take his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) family into exile for seven years
in order to atone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) gathers his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) most valuable belongings and takes
his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) family to his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) mother's natal village, Mbanta. The men from Ogbuefi Ezeudu's
quarter burn Okonkwo's buildings and kill his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) animals to cleanse
the village of his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) sin. Okonkwo's kinsmen, especially his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) uncle, Uchendu, receive
him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) warmly. They help him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) build a new compound of huts and lend
him (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) yam seeds to start a farm. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) is bitterly disappointed
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) misfortune, Okonkwo reconciles himself to life in his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) motherland. During the second year of Okonkwo's exile, Obierika brings
several bags of cowries -LRB-shells used as currency-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) has made
by selling Okonkwo's yams. Obierika plans to continue to do so until Okonkwo
returns to the village. Obierika also brings the bad news that Abame,
another village, has been destroyed by the white man. Soon afterward, six missionaries travel to Mbanta. Through
an interpreter named Mr. Kiaga, the missionaries' leader, Mr. Brown, speaks
to the villagers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) tells them that their gods are false and that
worshipping more than one God is idolatrous. But the villagers do
not understand how the Holy Trinity can be accepted as one God.
Although his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) aim is to convert the residents of Umuofia to Christianity,
Mr. Brown does not allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) followers to antagonize the clan. Mr. Brown grows ill and is soon replaced by Reverend James Smith,
an intolerant and strict man. The more zealous converts are relieved
to be free of Mr. Brown's policy of restraint. One such convert,
Enoch, dares to unmask an egwugwu during the annual
ceremony to honor the earth deity, an act equivalent to killing
an ancestral spirit. The next day, the egwugwu burn
Enoch's compound and Reverend Smith's church to the ground. The District Commissioner is upset by the burning of the
church and requests that the leaders of Umuofia meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Commissioner</b></font>). Once
they are gathered, however, the leaders are handcuffed and thrown
in jail, where they suffer insults and physical abuse. After the prisoners are released, the clansmen hold a
meeting, during which five court messengers approach and order the
clansmen to desist. Expecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Commissioner</b></font>) fellow clan members to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Commissioner</b></font>)
in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader with his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) machete. When the crowd
allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>)
clan is not willing to go to war. When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo's compound,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. Obierika and his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) friends
lead the commissioner to the body. Obierika explains that suicide
is a grave sin; thus, according to custom, none of Okonkwo's clansmen
may touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) body. The commissioner, who is writing a book about
Africa, believes that the story of Okonkwo's rebellion and death
will make for an interesting paragraph or two. He (<font color='blue'><b>Okonkwo</b></font>) has already chosen
the book's title: The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes
of the Lower Niger.
