architect, reclines with his three roommates on the terrace of their
thirty-first-floor sublet. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) imagines himself as a grown man recounting
the experience of y2k to his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) grandchildren.
Realizing how unimportant the event was, he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) laughs at his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) own imagined
future. The idea of anyone his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) age actually having kids at all,
let alone grandkids, seems ridiculous to him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>). Nathaniel's middle-aged uncle, Lucien, meanwhile, is in
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) office with his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) assistant, Sharmila, at his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) art gallery on the
other side of the city, and is just about to close up for the evening.
Lucien recalls a conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) had earlier in the day with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>)
client Yoshi Matsumoto, who informed Lucien that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) will soon return
to New York, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) claims is now <div class="bookquote">``back to normal.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This phrase
disturbs Lucien, who recalls why Matsumoto left in the first place
and how Nathaniel came to live in Matsumoto's apartment. Thinking about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) nephew and family in general also prompts Lucien to think about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) late wife, Charlie, who died of cancer. Meanwhile, Nathaniel sips champagne on the balcony of
Matsumoto's apartment along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) three roommates--Madison, Lyle, and
Amity--and Amity's agent, Russell, to toast the end of their three-year
stay in the apartment. They have lived in the apartment since Lucien
helped Nathaniel settle in the city in 2000.
Nathaniel and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) roommates recall witnessing the terrorist attack
on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001,
while eating breakfast on the terrace. The event was traumatic for
all of them, and it took a long time before any of them could relax
on the terrace again. Their toast marks a significant time in their
lives, and Nathaniel realizes that they may all go in separate directions
once Matsumoto returns. Lucien plans to spend the evening as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) usually does,
alone with a glass of wine. The thought of doing so, however, makes
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) feel very old, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) suddenly has the desire to give Sharmila
some advice about life and share some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) wisdom with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sharmila</b></font>). But,
realizing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sharmila</b></font>) wouldn't be interested, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Sharmila</b></font>) home instead. Lucien
then begins daydreaming of Charlie, which reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) of Nathaniel
and Nathaniel's parents, Isaac and Rose, who'd been Charlie's sister.
They had asked Lucien and Charlie to look after their son when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>)'d
first moved to the city, which had irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>), not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>)
disliked Nathaniel but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) felt that Rose and Isaac doted
on the boy too much. Since Charlie's death, Rose and Isaac had ironically become more involved
in Lucien's life, which irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) even more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) realizes that
Rose and Isaac immigrated to America from Eastern Europe, where
they'd faced terrible persecution. At the same time, Lucien is grateful
for Rose and Isaac because they remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) deceased wife.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) misses Charlie very much and spends a great deal of time reminiscing
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) life with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Nathaniel, meanwhile, recalls the time when Aunt Charlie
and Uncle Lucien visited his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) family in the Midwest. The visit, however, was
not exactly pleasant. A rivalry existed between Charlie and Rose,
and Nathaniel believes that the bitterness even lasted up until Charlie's
death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) finds it ironic that New York City, the place that offered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) parents safe haven when they first immigrated to the country,
is now his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) home. Meanwhile, Lucien remembers his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) elementary school teacher, Miss
Mueller. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mueller</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) history teacher, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) reminisces about how
much of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mueller</b></font>) taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) is now considered incorrect. Nathaniel recounts the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) comic book creation,
Passivityman. Although his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) Passivityman comic is popular in the
Midwest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) begins to realize that the comic doesn't hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) interest
as much as it once did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) isn't sure if that's because he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>)'s busier
these days or has less drive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) looks around at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) friends, those
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) used as models for his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) comic book characters, and wonders if
superpowers fade naturally as one gets older. Lucien begins to recount the events of the morning of
September 11, 2001,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) was far from the World Trade Center site that morning
but headed straight to Ground Zero when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) heard the news in an
effort to find Nathaniel. As Nathaniel reconstructs the day in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) simultaneously recalls
a fleeting affair with the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) stayed with for a time after 9/11.
The relationship didn't fulfill him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) in any way. Lucien recounts the aftermath of 9/11 and
the impact it had on the city. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) than realizes that while most
things seem to have gone back to normal, the normality is only a
fa√ßade. Lucien thinks his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucien</b></font>) perspective on things has changed irrevocably
because of the event. Nathaniel, on the other hand, continues drinking with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) housemates, looking into the future. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) realizes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) relationship
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) parents has grown gentler and more mature over the years.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) friends toast their time in Matsumoto's apartment, and Nathaniel
thinks about a dream he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) had involving his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathaniel</b></font>) love interest, Delphine. Across town, Lucien toasts to the open air and thinks,
abstractly, pessimistically, about the future.
