Omaha, Nebraska. The Midwest, during this period, is full of discrimination
and racial violence. Malcolm's family moves to Michigan where they
continue to experience persecution and violence. White people murder
Malcolm's father and force his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) mother into a mental hospital. After
living in a Michigan detention home and completing the eighth grade,
Malcolm moves to Boston, Massachusetts, to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) half-sister,
Ella. In Boston Malcolm quickly becomes involved in urban nightlife.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) passes for being much older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) is, wearing flashy clothes,
gambling, drinking, doing drugs, and dating an older white woman,
Sophia. Malcolm eventually takes a job as a railway porter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) then
moves to New York, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) begins working as a hustler in Harlem.
Malcolm's various jobs there include running numbers, selling drugs,
and steering white people to black brothels. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) also commits armed
robberies. When life in Harlem becomes too dangerous, Malcolm returns
to Boston, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) becomes a house burglar and is eventually arrested.
In prison, Malcolm transforms himself, converting to the branch
of Islam promoted by the Nation of Islam, which has already converted
a number of Malcolm's siblings. Inspired by the faith, Malcolm stops
using drugs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) reads voraciously, prays, studies English and Latin,
and joins the prison debate team. The prison releases Malcolm on parole. Malcolm moves in
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) brother Wilfred and becomes very active in the Detroit
temple of the Nation of Islam. Malcolm receives permission to drop
his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) last name, which a white slave owner gave to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) ancestors.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) adopts the placeholder <div class="bookquote">``X''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) last name, using the letter
to represent the lost name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) African ancestors. Malcolm X soon
meets the Nation of Islam's leader, Elijah Muhammad, and rises quickly from
the rank of temple assistant in Detroit to the Nation's first national
minister. Malcolm X becomes known throughout the United States,
even outside of Muslim circles, as a fiery advocate for black unity
and militancy. The Nation of Islam's leaders resent and fear Malcolm
despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) allegiance to their cause, and they suspend him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) from
the organization. The Nation of Islam's frustration with Malcolm intensifies,
and Malcolm begins receiving death threats. After a divisive argument with
Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm leaves the Nation of Islam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) uses his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)
fame to found his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) own organization, Muslim Mosque, Inc.. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) sees
his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) organization as more politically active than the Nation of Islam.
On a trip to the Middle East and Africa, Malcolm discovers what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) sees as true Islam. This version of Islam contrasts with the
version of Islam he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) has been teaching. By the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) life, Malcolm
X is an international figure, welcomed by foreign leaders and committed
to Islam as a religion that can alleviate the racial problems of
the United States. He (<font color='blue'><b>X</b></font>) is assassinated in 1965.
