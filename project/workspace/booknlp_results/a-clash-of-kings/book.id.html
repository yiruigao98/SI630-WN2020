Joff Lannister, who is still a young boy, has recently become king, but Stannis Baratheon and Renly Baratheon both want the crown for themselves. Robb Stark, meanwhile, has recently taken the title of King of the North. Far to the north of this action, the men of the Night's Watch leave the safety of the Wall to investigate the disappearance of the wilding people, enemies who live in primitive bands and villages in the vast wilderness north of the Wall. Meanwhile, across the narrow sea, Daenerys Targaryen leads her (<font color='blue'><b>Lannister</b></font>) beleaguered band of Dothrakis in search of enough wealth and soldiers to return to Westeros and capture the Iron Throne. Simultaneous developments within these three plots constitute the major action of the novel. Robb Stark, King of the North, tries to secure an alliance with the Greyjoys of the Iron Islands by sending Theon Greyjoy, a ward of the Stark family who has been like a brother to Robb, to negotiate. Theon, however, turns against the Starks, who kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Starks</b></font>) at Winterfell against his (<font color='blue'><b>Starks</b></font>) will, and the Greyjoys not only rebuff Robb's offer but attack the west coast of the North. At Winterfell, young Bran Stark chafes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) is left in charge. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) dreams, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) inhabits the body of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) direwolf, Summer. Jojen and Meera Reed arrive at Winterfell, and the three bond over Jojen and Bran's supernatural powers. Vainglorious Theon then attacks Winterfell, seizing Bran and Rickon as hostages. He (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) pretends to kill Bran and Rickon, which disgusts everyone. Theon lacks men and enters into an alliance with a group led by Ramsay Bolton. This group turns on Theon, takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) captive, and decimates Winterfell. Bran, Hodor, and the Reeds escape Winterfell and head to the Wall, where Jojen will continue Bran's mystical training. Osha takes Rickon south. Stannis Baratheon, older brother of Robert, declares himself the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. With the support of Melisandre, a red priestess, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) attacks his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) brother Renly, who has also declared himself king. Catelyn Stark arrives at Storm's End to broker a truce between Stannis and Renly, but instead she (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) witnesses the death of Renly at the hands of a mysterious shadow. She (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) flees with Brienne of Tarth, a female knight who was part of Renly's guard. Storm's End finally falls after Ser Davos takes Melisandre below the castle at night, where he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) watches her (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) give birth to a shadow assassin much like the one Catelyn saw. Catelyn returns to Riverrun to tend to her (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) dying father, Lord Hoster Tully. Hearing of the supposed deaths of Bran and Rickon, Catelyn goes to the dungeon to question Jaime Lannister, a skilled knight whom Robb Stark captured in battle in the previous novel. Tyrion arrives at King's Landing to act as Hand on behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) father, Lord Tywin Lannister. Against his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) father's wishes, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) has brought his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) prostitute lover, Shae. While Tyrion feels some loyalty to House Lannister, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) mistrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sister, Cersei, and wants to see justice prevail. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fortifies the city, forging alliances with two powerful members of the royal council, Littlefinger and Varys, and banishing, killing, or imprisoning those who have committed crimes, even if said crimes were committed at Cersei's behest. Stannis leads a massive attack against King's Landing and the Lannisters by land and sea in an effort to take the throne by force. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) loses, thanks to Tyrion's cunning and foresight and the surprise arrival of Tywin's army. During this battle, Ser Mandon Moore attempts to assassinate Tyrion, who is saved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) squire, Podrick Payne. Posing as a boy, Arya Stark travels north to the Wall with Yoren, a recruiter for the Night's Watch. A vicious attack kills Yoren, but Arya escapes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) friends Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy Greenhands. In the process, she (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) saves the lives of three criminals, including a man from Braavos named Jaqen H'ghar. Neither Arya nor Gendry knows, but Gendry is actually the bastard son of Robert Baratheon, who was king before Joff Lannister. Arya and her (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) friends are captured and taken to Harrenhal to work as servants. Jaqen arrives at Harrenhal as part of a group called the Brave Companions. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) spots Arya, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) promises to kill any three people Arya names in return for her (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) saving his (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) life and the lives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) friends. Arya has Jaqen kill two people, then forces Jaqen to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) free a group of Northmen who she (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) believes will help her (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) return to Winterfell. Impressed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) cunning, Jaqen gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) a coin and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) can always get help from a Braavosi fighter if she (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) repeats a certain phrase he (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) teaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>). Arya again escapes with Gendry and Hot Pie. Meanwhile, a group of men from the Night's Watch leave the Wall and travel into the mysterious woods to the north. They spend the night at Craster's Keep, where Craster reveals that Mance Rayder is gathering all the wildings. They continue moving north, camping at the Fist of the First Men. Jeor Mormont sends Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand as reconnaissance scouts. The pair discover that the wildings are moving. Jon has a dream in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) becomes Ghost, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) direwolf. Later, the events of the dream come true, implying that Jon, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) half-brother Bran, is a warg -LRB-skinchanger-RRB-. Qhorin commands Jon to pretend to give up the Night's Watch and join the wildlings if they are captured, but to secretly keep gathering information. When the wildlings take Jon and Qhorin, they make the two fight to the death, and deliberately allows Jon to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) to convince the wildlings that Jon truly means to abandon the Watch. In the lands across the narrow sea, Daenerys Targaryen struggles. After the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Dothraki husband, a powerful warlord, her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Dothraki following dwindled. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) roams the Red Waste with a small, loyal band, including her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) handmaids, her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bloodriders, and Ser Jorah Mormont. Her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) three dragons continue to grow. For a time, they camp at an abandoned city, but eventually they continue to Qarth. Although the Qartheen are intrigued by her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) dragons, they will not help Daenerys raise an army to capture her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) rightful throne or fund her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) crossing of the narrow sea. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) is told to seek answers at the House of the Undying Ones, where she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) is beset by disturbing visions. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) dragons burns it down, which angers the Qartheen. Daenerys is saved from an assassination attempt by two strangers, Strong Belwas and Arstan Whitebeard. Acting on behalf of Illyrio Mopatis, they have arrived to take Daenerys back to Pentos. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) agrees.
