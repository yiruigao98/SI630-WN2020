The clones, referred to as students, grow up in special institutions away from the outside world. As young adults, they begin to donate their vital organs. All <div class="bookquote">``donors''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>receive care from designated <div class="bookquote">``carers,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>clones who have not yet begun the donation process. The clones continue to donate organs until they <div class="bookquote">``complete,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which is a euphemism for death after the donation of three or four organs. However, this premise is not immediately apparent to the reader. At the start of the novel, narrator Kathy H. merely introduces herself as a thirty-one-year-old carer. She (<font color='blue'><b>carer</b></font>) has been a carer for nearly twelve years, but will leave her (<font color='blue'><b>carer</b></font>) role in a few months. Kathy explains that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) wants to revisit her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) memories of Tommy and Ruth, two friends who grew up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) at the Hailsham school. Kathy does not explain the donation program, or mention that Hailsham students are clones. Although Kathy's narration is often nonlinear, the novel's three parts roughly align with three stages in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) life. In Part One, Kathy remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) childhood at Hailsham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) describes her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) friendship with Ruth, whose temperamental personality contrasts with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) own quiet demeanor. At Hailsham, Ruth often annoys Kathy by pretending to have special knowledge and privileges. Kathy also describes Tommy, a student known for throwing violent temper tantrums. Tommy is initially an outcast among his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) peers because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) lacks artistic ability, which the Hailsham staff -LRB-part teacher, part parent figures known as <div class="bookquote">``guardians'' (<font color='red'><b>parent</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, and its students value highly. Kathy sympathizes with Tommy, and tries to calm him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) down during one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) tantrums. Tommy later learns to control his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) temper after a guardian named Miss Lucy assures him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) that it is not necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) to be creative. Although the students learn vaguely about the donation program, their guardians shield them from a full understanding of their future. Miss Lucy disagrees with this indirect approach, and often exhibits strange behavior in front of the students as a result, in one instance telling them explicitly about their futures. After Miss Lucy speaks with Tommy about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) artwork, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) and Kathy theorize that creativity may be connected to donations. They speculate about Madame, a woman who visits Hailsham to collect the best student artwork. Madame is rumored to keep this art in a personal gallery. Kathy later encounters Madame in the girls' dormitory, while Kathy dances to the song <div class="bookquote">``Never Let Me Go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kathy</b></font>)</div>The song is Kathy's favorite track on Songs After Dark, a Judy Bridgewater album that is one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) most prized possessions. When the song ends, Kathy sees Madame crying in the doorway. Shortly afterwards, Kathy loses her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) tape. Tommy's temper returns during their last summer at Hailsham. Kathy thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) is upset about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) recent breakup with Ruth, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) has dated for six months. But Tommy is upset about Miss Lucy, who recently told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was wrong to dismiss the importance of creativity. Miss Lucy departs Hailsham abruptly, and Tommy mends his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) relationship with Ruth. In Part Two, Kathy moves with Ruth and Tommy to a transitional housing facility known as the Cottages. They adjust to their new lives, becoming acquainted with the <div class="bookquote">``veteran''  (<font color='red'><b>the veteran students</b></font>)</div>students living there already. Ruth often ignores Tommy and Kathy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) efforts to blend in with the veterans, who are not from Hailsham. Kathy notices that the veterans regard the Hailsham students with awe. One couple, Chrissie and Rodney, are especially interested in Hailsham. They convince Ruth to go with them to Norfolk, where Rodney claims to have seen Ruth's <div class="bookquote">``possible''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruth</b></font>)</div>in an open-plan office -LRB-a <div class="bookquote">``possible''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruth</b></font>)</div>is a human that resembles a specific clone and from whom that clone's DNA may have been copied-RRB-. Kathy is skeptical of Rodney's story, especially since it features Ruth's <div class="bookquote">``dream future''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruth</b></font>)</div>of working in an open-plan office. In the end, Kathy, Tommy, Ruth, Rodney, and Chrissie all drive to Norfolk. In Norfolk, Chrissie and Rodney ask about a rumored exception allowing Hailsham couples in love to defer their donations. Ruth pretends to know something about deferrals, which surprises Kathy and Tommy. The students eventually find the open-plan office. Rodney points to a woman in the window, and they all agree that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) could be Ruth's legitimate possible. They follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) to an art gallery, where they realize that the woman does not actually resemble Ruth. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) disappointment, Ruth says that the students are modeled only on <div class="bookquote">``trash.''  (<font color='red'><b>the students</b></font>)</div>Ruth goes off with Chrissie and Rodney. Meanwhile, Tommy and Kathy find a copy of Kathy's lost tape in a secondhand store. Tommy tells Kathy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) has begun drawing pictures of imaginary animals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) thinks Madame uses the students' artwork to determine if couples applying for deferrals are truly in love. After Norfolk, Ruth stops talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) dream future. Tommy shows his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) drawings to Kathy, who finds them puzzling but captivating. Meanwhile, Kathy's friendship with Ruth grows increasingly tense. Ruth reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) knows Kathy likes Tommy, but says that Tommy will never return Kathy's feelings. Shortly afterwards, Kathy submits her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) application for carer training and departs. Part Three focuses on Kathy's time as carer. While Kathy is good at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) job, the work is both difficult and lonely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) unexpectedly runs into a Hailsham friend named Laura, who is also a carer. They talk about Ruth, who had a bad first donation. They also talk about Hailsham, which has closed. Kathy becomes Ruth's carer, but their relationship is strained and guarded. One day, Ruth expresses a desire to visit a beached fishing boat near Tommy's recovery center. They pick up Tommy on the way to the boat, which they find bleached and crumbling in a marsh. The marsh reminds both Tommy and Ruth of Hailsham. They also discuss Chrissie, who completed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) second donation. On the return trip, Ruth apologizes for keeping Tommy and Kathy apart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) encourages them to pursue a deferral, revealing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) has discovered Madame's home address. In the weeks that follow, Kathy and Ruth reminisce peacefully about Hailsham and the Cottages. Ruth also encourages Kathy to become Tommy's carer. Ruth completes after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) second donation. Tommy gives his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) third donation, and Kathy becomes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) carer. They spend their days reading and talking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) recovery center. Eventually, they also begin to have sex. Hoping to pursue a deferral, they go to visit Madame at the address Ruth provided. Madame invites them inside and listens to their request, after which Miss Emily appears from the next room. Miss Emily says that deferrals do not exist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) explains that Hailsham was part of a progressive movement committed to raising clones more humanely. Madame used to exhibit the students' artwork to show the outside world that clones had souls. Although the movement once had many supporters, changing public opinion eventually forced Hailsham to close. On the drive back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hailsham</b></font>) recovery center, Tommy asks Kathy to pull over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) walks into the woods and begins screaming. Kathy goes to Tommy and holds him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>). Soon after, Tommy gives his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) fourth donation and completes. Kathy drives to a field in Norfolk, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) allows herself to imagine Tommy on the horizon. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) drives away.
