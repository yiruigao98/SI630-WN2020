Lewis says he (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) discovered the bundle of Screwtape's letters somewhere, but will not say how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lewis</b></font>) managed to come across them. Screwtape is a devil, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) warns the reader, and Screwtape's version of events, therefore, should not be taken as the truth. Then the letters begin. In them, Screwtape advises his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) nephew, Wormwood, on how best to tempt a British man, called only <div class="bookquote">``the Patient,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>into sin and, eventually, into Hell. Wormwood is an inexperienced devil, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hasgone to a training college to help prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to tempt humans into sin. Screwtape complains, however, that this college has taught Wormwood nothing because of its incompetent director, Slubgob. By the second letter, readers learn that the Patient has converted to Christianity and has begun going to church. The Patient is most likely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) mid-thirties and he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) lives with and takes care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) aging mother. The Patient's mother is a difficult woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) makes many demands on the Patient's time and energy. In the early letters, Screwtape advises Wormwood to make the Patient think that being Christian is an internal, spiritual thing rather than an external way of being in the world. After the Patient prays, Wormwood should make him (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) fight with his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) mother about insignificant details about the house and chores. Over the course of these early letters, the dynamic between Screwtape and Wormwood begins to take shape. Wormwood keeps himself invisible as he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) follows the Patient around on Earth.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) essentially whispers in the Patient's ear, encouraging the Patient to experience negative emotions and to pursue unhealthy distractions. Unlike Wormwood, Screwtape is an experienced tempter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) has already won souls for Hell. This has earned him (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>), it seems, a mid-management position in Hell's vast <div class="bookquote">``Lowerarchy'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--a devilish corporation that determines how best to organize Hell's temptation strategies on Earth. After World War II begins, the Patient worries about whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) will be drafted. Screwtape advises Wormwood to exploit the Patient's uncertainty, and soon, there is a period of relative inactivity during the war. During this time, Patient makes new, unnamed friends. These friends, however, are not Christians. They are skeptical and worldly. Screwtape advises Wormwood to make the Patient a hypocrite. The Patient should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) is better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) fellow, humble churchgoers because he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) has such smart and sophisticated friends, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) is better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) friends because he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>), unlike them, is a Christian. As a result of the negative influence of these friends on the Patient, Wormwood, very briefly, seems to be doing a good job winning over the Patient's soul. Soon, however, after reading a book and going on a walk by an old mill, the Patient experiences a reawakening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) faith. This reawakening amounts to a second conversion, and, during it, the Enemy--God--forms a barrier of grace around the Patient that appears to Wormwood as a noxious fog. After the Patient's second conversion, Screwtape advises Wormwood to tempt the Patient with sexual pleasures. Screwtape instructs Wormwood to make a list of all the young women in the Patient's neighborhood that would prove to be bad marriages matches for the Patient. But the Patient falls in love withthe Woman. A Christian girl a Christian family, the Woman has a tremendously positive influence on the Patient's life. Screwtape hates the Woman. During this time, Wormwood reports Screwtape to Hell's secret police because Screwtape writes that the Enemy really loves humans. In Hell, this claim is heresy. It contradicts Hell's essential teachingthat the Enemy's love is a lie that the Enemy uses to mask His (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) self-interest. Wormwood continues to make poor progress with the Patient and, during an episode of intense anger, Screwtape transforms into a giant centipede. This is a normal occurrence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) , an outward manifestation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) inner <div class="bookquote">``Life Force.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>is able to clear his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) name with Hell's authorities by explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) was only speaking of the Enemy's love for humans as an analogy for the Enemy's incomprehensible preoccupation with humankind. World War II, meanwhile, grows active again. The Germans begin to drop bombs on the Patient's unnamed hometown. The Patient's unspecified duties place him (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) in harms way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) soon begins to fear for his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) life. Screwtape advises Wormwood to exploit the Patient's cowardice, but not to the extent that the Patient prays for help with it. During one bombing, the Patient acts according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) duty. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) is afraid, however, the Patient feels himself to be a coward. This is bad news for Wormwood, Screwtape says. It keeps the Patient humble. Screwtape warns Wormwood that the Patient's soul is prepared for Heaven, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) advises Wormwood to keep the Patient alive as long as possible. That way, Wormwood can use the Patient's whole life to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) away from the Enemy and into sin. But the Patient dies during a German air raid, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) soul is taken into Heaven. Because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) failure, Wormwood must take the Patient's place.  Wormwood begs Screwtape for mercy, but Screwtape laughs, saying there is no mercy in Hell. Screwtape concludes the final letter by saying how excited he (<font color='blue'><b>Patient</b></font>) is at the prospect of eating Wormwood alive.
