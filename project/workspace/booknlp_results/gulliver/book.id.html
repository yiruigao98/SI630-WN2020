the story of Lemuel Gulliver, a practical-minded Englishman trained
as a surgeon who takes to the seas when his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) business fails. In a
deadpan first-person narrative that rarely shows any signs of self-reflection
or deep emotional response, Gulliver narrates the adventures that
befall him (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) on these travels. Gulliver's adventure in Lilliput begins when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) wakes
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) shipwreck to find himself bound by innumerable tiny threads
and addressed by tiny captors who are in awe of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) but fiercely
protective of their kingdom. They are not afraid to use violence
against Gulliver, though their arrows are little more than pinpricks.
But overall, they are hospitable, risking famine in their land by
feeding Gulliver, who consumes more food than a thousand Lilliputians combined
could. Gulliver is taken into the capital city by a vast wagon the
Lilliputians have specially built. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) is presented to the emperor,
who is entertained by Gulliver, just as Gulliver is flattered by
the attention of royalty. Eventually Gulliver becomes a national resource,
used by the army in its war against the people of Blefuscu, whom
the Lilliputians hate for doctrinal differences concerning the proper
way to crack eggs. But things change when Gulliver is convicted
of treason for putting out a fire in the royal palace with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) urine
and is condemned to be shot in the eyes and starved to death. Gulliver
escapes to Blefuscu, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>)
is able to repair a boat he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) finds and set sail for England. After staying in England with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) wife and family for
two months, Gulliver undertakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) next sea voyage, which takes
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) to a land of giants called Brobdingnag. Here, a field worker discovers
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>). The farmer initially treats him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) as little more than an animal, keeping
him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) for amusement. The farmer eventually sells Gulliver to the queen, who
makes him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) a courtly diversion and is entertained by his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) musical talents.
Social life is easy for Gulliver after his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) discovery by the court,
but not particularly enjoyable. Gulliver is often repulsed by the
physicality of the Brobdingnagians, whose ordinary flaws are many
times magnified by their huge size. Thus, when a couple of courtly
ladies let him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) play on their naked bodies, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) is not attracted to
them but rather disgusted by their enormous skin pores and the sound
of their torrential urination. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) is generally startled by the ignorance
of the people here--even the king knows nothing about politics. More
unsettling findings in Brobdingnag come in the form of various animals
of the realm that endanger his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) life. Even Brobdingnagian insects
leave slimy trails on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) food that make eating difficult. On a
trip to the frontier, accompanying the royal couple, Gulliver leaves
Brobdingnag when his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) cage is plucked up by an eagle and dropped
into the sea. Next, Gulliver sets sail again and, after an attack by
pirates, ends up in Laputa, where a floating island inhabited by
theoreticians and academics oppresses the land below, called Balnibarbi.
The scientific research undertaken in Laputa and in Balnibarbi seems
totally inane and impractical, and its residents too appear wholly
out of touch with reality. Taking a short side trip to Glubbdubdrib, Gulliver
is able to witness the conjuring up of figures from history, such
as Julius Caesar and other military leaders, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) finds much
less impressive than in books. After visiting the Luggnaggians and
the Struldbrugs, the latter of which are senile immortals who prove
that age does not bring wisdom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) is able to sail to Japan and from
there back to England. Finally, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) fourth journey, Gulliver sets out as
captain of a ship, but after the mutiny of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) crew and a long confinement
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) cabin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) arrives in an unknown land. This land is populated
by Houyhnhnms, rational-thinking horses who rule, and by Yahoos, brutish
humanlike creatures who serve the Houyhnhnms. Gulliver sets about
learning their language, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) can speak he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) narrates his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) voyages
to them and explains the constitution of England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) is treated
with great courtesy and kindness by the horses and is enlightened
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) many conversations with them and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) exposure to their
noble culture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) wants to stay with the Houyhnhnms, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) bared
body reveals to the horses that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) is very much like a Yahoo, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) is banished. Gulliver is grief-stricken but agrees to leave.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) fashions a canoe and makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) way to a nearby island, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) is picked up by a Portuguese ship captain who treats him (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) well,
though Gulliver cannot help now seeing the captain--and all humans--as
shamefully Yahoolike. Gulliver then concludes his (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) narrative with
a claim that the lands he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) has visited belong by rights to England,
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) colonies, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gulliver</b></font>) questions the whole idea of colonialism.
