is named Tim O'Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred
in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) Vietnam experience. <div class="bookquote">``The Things They Carried''
 (<font color='red'><b>fellow</b></font>)</div>catalogs the variety of things his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company
brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible,
including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects,
including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and
M&M's candy. Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear
in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die
is Ted Lavender, a <div class="bookquote">``grunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ted Lavender/Lavender</b></font>)</div>or low-ranking soldier, who deals with
his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana.
Lavender is shot in the head on his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) way back from going to the bathroom,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the
tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with
thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in <div class="bookquote">``Love''  (<font color='red'><b>Jimmy Cross/Cross</b></font>)</div>that
Cross's feelings for Martha, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) dated once before leaving for
Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after
the war, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) guilt over Lavender's death remains. In <div class="bookquote">``On the Rainy River,''  (<font color='red'><b>the narrator</b></font>)</div>the narrator, O'Brien, explains
the series of events that led him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) to Vietnam in the first place.
He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) receives his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) draft notice in June of 1968,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) feelings of confusion drive him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) north to the Canadian border,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) contemplates crossing so that he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) will not be forced to
fight in a war in which he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) doesn't believe. Sitting in a rowboat
with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) stays, O'Brien
decides that his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing
his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) family are more important than his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) political convictions. He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)
soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and
later to Vietnam. In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the
Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including
Curt Lemon, who is killed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lemon</b></font>) steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O'Brien is not close to Lemon, in <div class="bookquote">``The Dentist,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lemon</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup
with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that
a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of
the company, dies from injuries he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) sustains by stepping on a landmine.
In <div class="bookquote">``Friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)</div>O'Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt,
Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably
harmed, the other man would see that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quickly killed. However,
when Strunk is actually hurt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strunk</b></font>) begs Jensen to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Jensen</b></font>), and Jensen
complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jensen</b></font>) friend's swift
death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved. The death that receives the most attention in The
Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member
of the Alpha Company and one of O'Brien's closest friends. In <div class="bookquote">``Speaking
of Courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kiowa</b></font>)</div>the story of Kiowa's death is relayed in retrospect
through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker
drives around a lake in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowker</b></font>) Iowa hometown, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowker</b></font>) thinks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowker</b></font>) failed
to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bowker</b></font>) to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O'Brien realizes that
he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) has dealt with his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) guilt over Kiowa's death differently than
Norman Bowker in <div class="bookquote">``Notes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Norman Bowker/Bowker</b></font>)</div>Just before the end of the war, O'Brien
receives a long letter from Bowker that says he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) hasn't found a way
to make life meaningful after the war. O'Brien resolves to tell
Bowker's story, and the story of Kiowa's death, in order to negotiate
his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) own feelings of guilt and hollowness. Like <div class="bookquote">``Love''  (<font color='red'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Notes,''  (<font color='red'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)</div>several of O'Brien's stories
are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts.
Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman
Bowker prompts him (<font color='blue'><b>Bowker</b></font>) to write stories in order to understand what
they were going through. But two stories, <div class="bookquote">``The Man I Killed''  (<font color='red'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)</div>and
<div class="bookquote">``Ambush,''  (<font color='red'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)</div>are written so that O'Brien can confront his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) own guilt
over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe.
In <div class="bookquote">``The Man I Killed,''  (<font color='red'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)</div>O'Brien imagines the life of his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) victim,
from his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) childhood to the way things would have turned out for him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)
had O'Brien not spotted him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) on a path and thrown a grenade at his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)
feet. In <div class="bookquote">``Ambush,''  (<font color='red'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)</div>O'Brien imagines how he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) might relay the story
of the man he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) killed to his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In
this second story, O'Brien provides more details of the actual killing--including the
sound of the grenade and his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) own feelings--and explains that even
well after the fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) hasn't finished sorting out the experience. In the last story, <div class="bookquote">``The Lives of the Dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)</div>O'Brien gives
another twist to his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) contention that stories have the power to save
people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O'Brien explains
that his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) imagination allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) to grapple successfully with his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>)
guilt and confusion over the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Brien</b></font>) fourth-grade first love,
Linda.
