St. Bernard and half sheepdog, lives on Judge Miller's estate in
California's Santa Clara Valley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) leads a comfortable life there,
but it comes to an end when men discover gold in the Klondike region
of Canada and a great demand arises for strong dogs to pull sleds.
Buck is kidnapped by a gardener on the Miller estate and sold to
dog traders, who teach Buck to obey by beating him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) with a club and,
subsequently, ship him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) north to the Klondike. Arriving in the chilly North, Buck is amazed by the cruelty
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sees around him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). As soon as another dog from his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ship, Curly,
gets off the boat, a pack of huskies violently attacks and kills
her (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). Watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) death, Buck vows never to let the same fate befall
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). Buck becomes the property of Francois and Perrault, two mail
carriers working for the Canadian government, and begins to adjust
to life as a sled dog. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) recovers the instincts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) wild ancestors:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) learns to fight, scavenge for food, and sleep beneath the snow
on winter nights. At the same time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) develops a fierce rivalry
with Spitz, the lead dog in the team. One of their fights is broken
up when a pack of wild dogs invades the camp, but Buck begins to
undercut Spitz's authority, and eventually the two dogs become involved
in a major fight. Buck kills Spitz and takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) place as the lead
dog. With Buck at the head of the team, Francois and Perrault's
sled makes record time. However, the men soon turn the team over
to a mail carrier who forces the dogs to carry much heavier loads.
In the midst of a particularly arduous trip, one of the dogs becomes
ill, and eventually the driver has to shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>). At the end of this
journey, the dogs are exhausted, and the mail carrier sells them
to a group of American gold hunters--Hal, Charles, and Mercedes. Buck's new masters are inexperienced and out of place
in the wilderness. They overload the sled, beat the dogs, and plan
poorly. Halfway through their journey, they begin to run out of
food. While the humans bicker, the dogs begin to starve, and the
weaker animals soon die. Of an original team of fourteen, only five
are still alive when they limp into John Thornton's camp, still
some distance from their destination. Thornton warns them that the
ice over which they are traveling is melting and that they may fall
through it. Hal dismisses these warnings and tries to get going
immediately. The other dogs begin to move, but Buck refuses. When
Hal begins to beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), Thornton intervenes, knocking a knife from
Hal's hand and cutting Buck loose. Hal curses Thornton and starts
the sled again, but before they have gone a quarter of a mile, the
ice breaks open, swallowing both the humans and the dogs. Thornton becomes Buck's master, and Buck's devotion to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) is total. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) saves Thornton from drowning in a river, attacks
a man who tries to start a fight with Thornton in a bar, and, most
remarkably, wins a $1,600 wager for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) new
master by pulling a sled carrying a thousand-pound load. But Buck's
love for Thornton is mixed with a growing attraction to the wild,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) feels as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) is being called away from civilization and
into the wilderness. This feeling grows stronger when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) accompanies
Thornton and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) friends in search of a lost mine hidden deep in
the Canadian forest. While the men search for gold, Buck ranges far afield,
befriending wolves and hunting bears and moose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) always returns
to Thornton in the end, until, one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) comes back to camp to
find that Yeehat Indians have attacked and killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) master. Buck attacks
the Indians, killing several and scattering the rest, and then heads
off into the wild, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) becomes the leader of a pack of wolves.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) becomes a legendary figure, a Ghost Dog, fathering countless
cubs and inspiring fear in the Yeehats--but every year he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) returns
to the place where Thornton died, to mourn his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) master before returning
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) life in the wild.
