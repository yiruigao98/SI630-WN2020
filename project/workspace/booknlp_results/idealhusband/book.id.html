Sir Robert, a prestigious member of the House of Commons, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife, Lady Gertrude Chiltern, are hosting a gathering that includes his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend Lord Goring, a dandified bachelor and close friend to the Chilterns, his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sister Mabel Chiltern, and other genteel guests. During the party, Mrs. Cheveley, an enemy of Lady Chiltern's from their school days, attempts to blackmail Sir Robert into supporting a fraudulent scheme to build a canal in Argentina. Apparently, Mrs. Cheveley's dead mentor, Baron Arnheim, convinced the young Sir Robert many years ago to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) a Cabinet secret, a secret that suggested he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) buy stocks in the Suez Canal three days before the British government announced its purchase. Sir Robert made his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) fortune with that illicit money, and Mrs. Cheveley has the letter to prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) crime. Fearing both the ruin of career and marriage, Sir Robert submits to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) demands. When Mrs. Cheveley pointedly informs Lady Chiltern of Sir Robert's change of heart regarding the canal scheme, the morally inflexible Lady, unaware of both her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) husband's past and the blackmail plot, insists that Sir Robert renege on his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) promise. For Lady Chiltern, their marriage is predicated on her (<font color='blue'><b>Chiltern</b></font>) having an <div class="bookquote">``ideal husband'' (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chiltern</b></font>)</div>--that is, a model spouse in both private and public life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Chiltern</b></font>) can worship: thus Sir Robert must remain unimpeachable in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) decisions. Sir Robert complies with the lady's wishes and apparently seals his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) doom. Also toward the end of Act I, Mabel and Lord Goring come upon a diamond brooch that Lord Goring gave someone many years ago. Goring takes the brooch and asks that Mabel inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) if anyone comes to retrieve it. In the second act, which also takes place at Sir Robert's house, Lord Goring urges Sir Robert to fight Mrs. Cheveley and admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) guilt to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) also reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) and Mrs. Cheveley were formerly engaged. After finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) conversation with Sir Robert, Goring engages in flirtatious banter with Mabel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) also takes Lady Chiltern aside and obliquely urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Chiltern</b></font>) to be less morally inflexible and more forgiving. Once Goring leaves, Mrs. Cheveley appears, unexpected, in search of a brooch she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) lost the previous evening. Incensed at Sir Robert's reneging on his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) promise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) ultimately exposes Sir Robert to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife once they are both in the room. Unable to accept a Sir Robert now unmasked, Lady Chiltern then denounces her (<font color='blue'><b>Chiltern</b></font>) husband and refuses to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). In the third act, set in Lord Goring's home, Goring receives a pink letter from Lady Chiltern asking for his (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) help, a letter that might be read as a compromising love note. Just as Goring receives this note, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) father, Lord Caversham, drops in and demands to know when his (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) son will marry. A visit from Sir Robert, who seeks further counsel from Goring, follows. Meanwhile, Mrs. Cheveley arrives unexpectedly and, misrecognized by the butler as the woman Goring awaits, is ushered into Lord Goring's drawing room. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) waits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) finds Lady Chiltern's letter. Ultimately, Sir Robert discovers Mrs. Cheveley in the drawing room and, convinced of an affair between these two former loves, angrily storms out of the house. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) and Lord Goring confront each other, Mrs. Cheveley makes a proposal: claiming to still love Goring from their early days of courtship, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) offers to exchange Sir Robert's letter for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) old beau's hand in marriage. Lord Goring declines, accusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) of defiling love by reducing courtship to a vulgar transaction and ruining the Chilterns' marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) then springs his (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) trap. Removing the diamond brooch from his (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) desk drawer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) binds it to Cheveley's wrist with a hidden device. Goring then reveals how the item came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) possession: apparently Mrs. Cheveley stole it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) cousin years ago. To avoid arrest, Cheveley must trade the incriminating letter for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) release from the bejeweled handcuff. After Goring obtains and burns the letter, however, Mrs. Cheveley steals Lady Chiltern's note from his (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) desk. Vengefully she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) plans to send it to Sir Robert misconstrued as a love letter addressed to the dandified lord. Mrs. Cheveley exits the house in triumph. The final act, which returns to Grosvenor Square, resolves the many plot complications sketched above with a decidedly happy ending. Lord Goring proposes to and is accepted by Mabel. Lord Caversham informs his (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) son that Sir Robert has denounced the Argentine canal scheme before the House. Lady Chiltern then appears, and Lord Goring informs her (<font color='blue'><b>Chiltern</b></font>) that Sir Robert's letter has been destroyed but that Mrs. Cheveley has stolen her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) letter and plans to use it to destroy her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheveley</b></font>) marriage. At that moment, Sir Robert enters while reading Lady Chiltern's letter, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) has mistaken it for a letter of forgiveness written for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). The two reconcile. The ever-upright Lady Chiltern then attempts to drive Sir Robert to renounce his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) career in politics, but Lord Goring dissuades her (<font color='blue'><b>Chiltern</b></font>) from doing so. When Sir Robert refuses Lord Goring his (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) sister's hand in marriage, still believing he (<font color='blue'><b>Goring</b></font>) has taken up with Mrs. Cheveley, Lady Chiltern is forced to explain last night's events and the true nature of the letter. Sir Robert relents, and Lord Goring and Mabel are permitted to wed..
