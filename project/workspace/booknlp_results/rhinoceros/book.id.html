Jean upbraids Berenger for his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) drinking habits and his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) aimlessness. Soon, a rhinoceros runs through the square -LRB-off-stage-RRB-, shocking all the townspeople with the exception of the indifferent Berenger. Jean lectures Berenger about will-power while a rational Logician explains the concept of a syllogism to an old man. Berenger concedes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) has a crush on Daisy, a typist at his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) office, but worries that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) favors Dudard, an up-and-coming co-worker. Jean recommends will-power and cultural self- improvement to garner Daisy's affections, and to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) life in general. Another rhino rushes by and tramples a cat. The townspeople debate whether or not it was the same rhino and what breed it was. Berenger and Jean get in a fight over the physical specifics of the rhino, and Jean storms off after calling Berenger a drunkard. The townspeople ask the Logician to clear up confusion, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) lengthy analysis makes no progress. The townspeople vow to stop the rhinos. Berenger expresses remorse for fighting with Jean, then says he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>)'s too upset to culture himself as planned and instead drinks. In Berenger's office, the co-workers argue with Botard, an old skeptic who doesn't believe in the rhinos. Berenger arrives late, but Daisy sneaks him (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) in. The employees ask Berenger if he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) saw the rhino. Botard claims the illusory appearance of the rhino is an example of <div class="bookquote">``collective psychosis.''  (<font color='red'><b>co-worker</b></font>)</div>They return to work, proof-reading law proposals, and wonder where co-worker Mr. Boeuf is. Mrs. Boeuf rushes in and says her (<font color='blue'><b>Boeuf</b></font>) husband is sick and will be back in a few days. She (<font color='blue'><b>Boeuf</b></font>) tells them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Boeuf</b></font>) was just chased by a rhino, which is now downstairs. The rhino crushes the staircase it tries to ascend, stranding the workers. Mrs. Boeuf recognizes the rhino as her (<font color='blue'><b>Boeuf</b></font>) husband. Daisy telephones the fire station to rescue them. The men give Mrs. Boeuf practical advice for dealing with this setback, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Boeuf</b></font>) is too devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Boeuf</b></font>) rhino-husband and vows to stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Boeuf</b></font>) jumps down to the ground floor and -LRB-off-stage-RRB- rides off on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back. More rhinos are reported in the town. The firemen arrive to help them out the window. Botard vows he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll solve the rhino-riddle. Berenger passes on an offer to drink with Dudard so he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) can visit Jean. Jean coughs in bed at home. Berenger visits and apologizes for their argument the previous day. At first, Jean has no recollection at all about the rhinoceroses. Jean's voice grows more hoarse, a bump on his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) nose continues to grow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) skin gets greener by the moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) becomes more misanthropic and savage. Berenger informs him (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) of Mr. Boeuf's transformation, which Jean applauds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) moves in and out of the bathroom, each time appearing and sounding more like a rhino. He (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) pronounces humanism dead, sheds his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) itchy clothes, tries to run down Berenger, apologizes, and runs into the bathroom. Berenger is about to escape, but follows Jean into the bathroom to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>). Off-stage in the bathroom, Jean attacks Berenger. Berenger escapes and closes the bathroom door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) -LRB-but is pierced by a rhino horn-RRB- as Jean, now a full-blown rhino, tries to break free. Berenger alerts the tenants in the building to the rhino's presence in the building, but everyone else has transformed as well. Berenger looks out the window, where a herd of rhinos march. The bathroom door is on the verge of breaking. Berenger throws himself against the wall and breaks through it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) runs through the street, yelling <div class="bookquote">``Rhinoceros!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Berenger wakes up from a nightmare in his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) room and inspects himself for any impending rhino-signs. Still human, he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) struggles not to drink, but eventually does. Dudard visits and they discuss Jean's transformation, which Berenger feels guilty about. They discuss the metamorphoses as an epidemic. Berenger takes another drink, under the premise that alcohol is an immunization. Dudard urges Berenger not to feel too guilty. Dudard reveals that Papillon, their boss, has turned into a rhinoceros. Berenger believes that for a man of Papillon's human stature to change, it must have been involuntary. Dudard considers the metamorphoses natural, while Berenger continues to find them abnormal. The flustered Berenger says he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) will seek the Logician's services in clearing this up. A herd of rhinos passes and Berenger spots the Logician's hat on a rhinoceros, a sign of metamorphosis, and vows not to become one as well. Daisy visits Berenger, which makes Dudard jealous. Daisy appears not to care too deeply about the epidemic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) informs them that Botard has metamorphosed. Berenger can't believe it, but then later rationalizes it. Daisy and Dudard iterate that acclimating oneself to the rhinos is the best solution, but Berenger resists. They start to have lunch, but are interrupted by a crumbling wall outside. The fire station has been sacked, and the firemen have turned into rhinos. Dudard leaves; he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) wants to experience the epidemic first-hand. Berenger tries to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>), but Daisy lets him (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) go. Dudard soon turns into a rhino outside. The sights and sounds of the rhinos become more beautiful despite their savagery. Berenger laments Dudard's demise, and Daisy reminds Berenger that they have no right to interfere in other's lives. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) pours some brandy for Berenger and removes his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) bandage--still no signs of a transformation. Berenger claims he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) will defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) blames himself and Daisy for contributing, through lack of sympathy, to the transformations of Jean and Papillon, respectively. Daisy convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) to shrug off the guilt. The phone rings, but they hear only rhino trumpeting on the line. They turn to the radio for help, but the rhinos have taken that over, as well. Upstairs, a rhino stampede disrupts the house's foundations. Daisy believes they must adapt to their new neighbors, but Berenger proposes they regenerate the human race, like Adam and Eve. Daisy finds the power of the rhinos seductive. Berenger slaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>), then apologizes and declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>)'ll never surrender and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) will protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) pledges her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) loyalty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>). The noise of the rhinos becomes more musical to Daisy, though Berenger still finds it savage and argues with her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>). Daisy breaks up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) and leaves. Berenger barricades his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) room and plugs his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) doubts his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) own humanity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) inspects photographs and cannot recognize any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) former friends--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) does identify himself and hangs three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) pictures on the wall beside the rhino heads. They turn out to be pictures of unattractive people and, compared to the elegant rhino heads, are even more grotesque. He (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) envies the bodies of the rhinos, but at the brink of desperation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) nevertheless decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Berenger</b></font>) will fight the rhinos.
