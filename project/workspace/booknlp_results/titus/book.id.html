Clarke Hulse's count, Titus Andronicus is a play with <div class="bookquote">``14 killings, 9 of them on stage, 6 severed members, 1 rape -LRB-or 2 or 3, depending on how you count-RRB-, 1 live burial, 1 case of insanity and 1 of cannibalism--an average of 5.2 atrocities per act, or one for every 97 lines.''  (<font color='red'><b>Titus</b></font>)</div>Reviewer Mike Gene Wallace adds, <div class="bookquote">``This is a great play. We're talking fourteen dead bodies, kung-fu, sword-fu, spear-fu, dagger-fu, arrow-fu, pie-fu, animal screams on the soundtrack, heads roll, hands roll, tongues roll, nine and a half quarts of blood, and a record-breaking 94 on the vomit meter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Reviewer Mike Gene Wallace</b></font>)</div>Really, there's not much more to say; that is the essence of the play. Titus Andronicus is a non-stop potboiler catalog of abominations -LRB-with the poetry itself counted as a crime by many critics-RRB-. Titus Andronicus, Roman general, returns from ten years of war with only four out of twenty-five sons left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) has captured Tamora, Queen of the Goths, her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) three sons, and Aaron the Moor. In obedience to Roman rituals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) sacrifices her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) eldest son to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) own dead sons, which earns him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) Tamora's unending hatred and her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) promise of revenge. Tamora is made empress by the new emperor Saturninus. To get back at Titus, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) schemes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) lover Aaron to have Titus's two sons framed for the murder of Bassianus, the emperor's brother. Titus's sons are beheaded. Unappeased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sons Chiron and Demetrius to rape Titus's daughter Lavinia, after which they cut off her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) hands and tongue so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) cannot give their crime away. Finally, even Titus's last surviving son Lucius is banished from Rome; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) subsequently seeks alliance with the enemy Goths in order to attack Rome. Each new misfortune hits the aged, tired Titus with heavier impact. Eventually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) begins to act oddly and everyone assumes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) is crazy. Tamora tries to capitalize on his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) seeming madness by pretending to be the figure of Revenge, come to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) justice if Titus will only convince Lucius to cease attacking Rome. Titus, having feigned his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) madness all along, tricks her (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>), captures her (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) sons, kills them, and makes pie out of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) feeds this pie to their mother in the final scene, after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) kills both Tamora and Lavinia, his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) own daughter. A rash of killings ensue; the only people left alive are Marcus, Lucius, Young Lucius, and Aaron. Lucius has the unrepentant Aaron buried alive, and Tamora's corpse thrown to the beasts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aaron</b></font>) becomes the new emperor of Rome.
