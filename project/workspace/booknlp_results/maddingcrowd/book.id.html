She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meets Gabriel Oak, a young farmer, and saves his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) life one evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) asks her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refuses because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). Upon inheriting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uncle's prosperous farm she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) moves away to the town of Weatherbury. A disaster befalls Gabriel's farm and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sheep; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) is forced to give up farming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) goes looking for work, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) travels finds himself in Weatherbury. After rescuing a local farm from fire he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) asks the mistress if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) needs a shepherd. It is Bathsheba, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hires him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). As Bathsheba learns to manage her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) farm she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) becomes acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) neighbor, Mr. Boldwood, and on a whim sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) a valentine with the words <div class="bookquote">``Marry me.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Boldwood becomes obsessed with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) and becomes her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) second suitor. Rich and handsome, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) has been sought after by many women. Bathsheba refuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) does not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) then agrees to reconsider her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) decision. That very night, Bathsheba meets a handsome soldier, Sergeant Troy. Unbeknownst to Bathsheba, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) has recently impregnated a local girl, Fanny Robin, and almost married her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Troy falls in love with Bathsheba, enraging Boldwood. Bathsheba travels to Bath to warn Troy of Boldwood's anger, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is there, Troy convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>). Gabriel has remained her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) friend throughout and does not approve of the marriage. A few weeks after his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) marriage to Bathsheba, Troy sees Fanny, poor and sick; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) later dies giving birth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) child. Bathsheba discovers that Troy is the father. Grief-stricken at Fanny's death and riddled with shame, Troy runs away and is thought to have drowned. With Troy supposedly dead, Boldwood becomes more and more emphatic about Bathsheba marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>). Troy sees Bathsheba at a fair and decides to return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Boldwood holds a Christmas, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) invites Bathsheba and again proposes marriage; just after she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has agreed, Troy arrives to claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Bathsheba screams, and Boldwood shoots Troy dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) is sentenced to life in prison. A few months later, Bathsheba marries Gabriel, now a prosperous bailiff.
