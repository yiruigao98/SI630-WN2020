He wants two good coonhounds very badly, but his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) Papa cannot afford any. Billy works hard, selling fruit and bait to fishermen, so eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) has enough money for the dogs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) gives the money to his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) grandfather, who orders the dogs for him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>). Billy sneaks off in the middle of the night to go to town and pick them up. While in town, other children pick on him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) stands up for himself and is helped by the marshal. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) way home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) two pups sleep in a cave. Outside, they hear a mountain lion, and the pups bravely howl back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) decides to name them Old Dan and Little Ann. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) can see that Old Dan is very brave, and that Little Ann is very smart. Once home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) wants to begin training them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) has to have a raccoon hide to train them with. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) grandfather shows him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) a way to set a trap that will catch even a clever coon. Just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) is about to give up on the traps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) catches a coon. The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) begins to train Old Dan and Little Ann. By the time raccoon season starts in the fall, they are ready. On the first night, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) dogs tree a coon in the biggest tree imaginable. Billy immediately sees that it will take days to cut down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) is determined to cut it down, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) dogs that if they could tree a coon he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) would take care of the rest. His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) dogs are counting on him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) parents bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) food. His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) grandfather shows him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) how to make a scarecrow, to keep the coon in the tree so he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) can go home and eat dinner. When the big sycamore finally falls and his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) dogs catch the coon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) is very proud. Billy goes coon hunting almost every night. His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) father relieves him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) chores, and Billy gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) the money from his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) coonskins. Sometimes, coons try to trick his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) dogs, and Old Dan gets into trouble. One night, Dan gets stuck in a muskrat hole. Another night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) climbs a tree. Little Ann is usually too smart to get into trouble, but one night, after the first snowfall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) falls through the ice on the river. Billy barely rescues her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>). One day, Billy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) grandfather make a bet with Ruben and Rainie Pritchard, that Billy's hounds can catch the legendary <div class="bookquote">``ghost coon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>The Pritchard boys set out with Billy to see if Old Dan and Little Ann can catch the ghost coon. The coon leads the dogs on a long, complicated chase, and the Pritchard boys want to give up. But Billy is determined. Finally, when the dogs have the coon treed, Billy refuses to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>). Just as Ruben starts to beat up Billy, Old Dan and Little Ann begin to attack the Pritchards' dog. Ruben runs to attack the dogs with an axe, but falls and kills himself. Billy is very distraught afterward. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) goes to Ruben's grave with some flowers, then feels much better. Billy's grandfather enters Billy in a coon-hunting contest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) grandfather, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) father take a buggy to the contest. It is filled with adult coon hunters with expensive gear and beautiful hounds. Somehow, Little Ann wins the beauty contest on the first day. The other coon hunters are very kind to Billy. Billy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) dogs qualify for the championship round. While Billy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) papa, his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) grandfather, and a judge are out hunting with coons, a winter blizzard begins. They lose track of the dogs, and Billy's grandfather falls and badly sprains his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) ankle. They stop and build a fire as day begins to break. Soon enough, they find the dogs, covered with ice. They have gotten just enough coons to win. Everyone at the tournament cheers. Billy has also won a jackpot of 300 dollars. Billy's mama and sisters are overjoyed. Billy keeps up his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) hunting. One night, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) dogs tree a mountain lion. Old Dan howls defiantly, and the big cat attacks. Billy is horrified, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) axe he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) enters the fray, hoping to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) dogs, but they end up having to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>). Eventually, the dogs defeat the mountain lion, but Old Dan is badly wounded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) dies the next day. Billy is heartbroken, but Little Ann is so sad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) loses her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) will to live, and dies a few days later. Billy's papa tries to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) that it is all for the best, because with the money Billy has earned, the family hopes to move to town. Billy does not completely recover until on the day of the move; he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) goes to visit the dogs' graves and finds a giant red fern. According to Indian legend, only an angel can plant a red fern. Billy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) family look at the fern in awe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) feels ready to leave for the town.
