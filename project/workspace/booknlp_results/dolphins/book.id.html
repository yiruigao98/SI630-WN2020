When the ship lands, the chief of their village -LRB-also their father-RRB-, Chowig goes to meet the visitors, along with a number of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) warriors. The representative of the strangers is Captain Orlov, a Russian, who has come with a native American tribe known as the Aleuts to hunt otter on the island of the blue dolphins -LRB-known to its inhabitants as Ghalas-at-RRB-. There is disagreement between the two, for the Aleuts had caused trouble on the island some years before. Finally, Chowig and Orlov reach an agreement, and the people of Ghalas-at let the Aleuts hunt otter on their island in return for half of their profits in the form of jewelry and iron spearheads. The Aleuts set up camp at one end of the island, and the Aleuts and the people of Ghalas-at keep close watch over on another, suspicious of being double-crossed. When the Aleuts start getting ready to leave, Chowig and his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlov</b></font>) warriors ask for their payment. The sum is unsatisfactory, however, and the two parties disagree. A fight breaks out. When the battle is done, the Aleuts have escaped, and many of the men of Ghalat-at have been killed, among them Chowig. A new chief, Kimki, comes to power, and after a dreary and sad winter, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) decides his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) tribe should leave Gahlas-at. He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) sets off alone to prepare a way for them in a new county he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had visited as a boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) is gone for a long time, but one day a ship with white sails comes to Ghalas-at. It carries a group of white men who say they were sent by Kimki to take the islanders away. The day is stormy, so the villagers need to board the boat quickly before the ship runs aground on the rocks of the island. In the confusion, Ramo forgets his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramo</b></font>) hunting spear. Karana tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramo</b></font>) there is no time to go back for it, but once Karana is on the ship, Ramo is nowhere to be found. As the ship pulls away from the island, Karana sees Ramo, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramo</b></font>) spear, back on the beach. Though others on the boat try to restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>), Karana jumps into the water and swims back to the island. Back on the island, Ramo and Karana work hard to provide for themselves. They gather food and prepare to stay for some time on the island--at least until the ship returns to take them away. Though Ramo is young, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramo</b></font>) is very confident and tries to do many things on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramo</b></font>) own. One morning, Karana awakes to find that Ramo is gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) goes out to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramo</b></font>), only to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramo</b></font>) dead, killed by the wild dogs of the island. After Ramo is killed, Karana decides to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) village forever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) burns it and sets up camp on a rock near the headland. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) makes tools to defend herself, although the laws of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) tribe bar a woman from making weapons. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) watches everyday for the ship that will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) away, but it never comes. One day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) takes a canoe and tries to make the journey herself. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) is able to paddle a great distance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) canoe starts to leak after a few days, and, realizing she (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) cannot reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) destination, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) turns back. Knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) could be on Ghalas-at for some time, Karana builds herself a house and some stronger weapons. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) has finished these necessities, Karana decides it is time to exact her (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) revenge on the wild dogs that killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) used fire to scare them out of their cave, and strikes down their leader along with several others. The lead dog is strong, however, and is able to escape even with an arrow lodged deeply in his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) chest. Days later, Karana finds the same dog, barely alive. Instead of killing him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) takes him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) home and nurses him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) back to health. The two become fast friends, and the dog, whom Karana calls Rontu even defends her (<font color='blue'><b>Kimki</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) former pack mates. One day, the Aleuts, who had killed so many of Karana's friends and family, return to Ghalas-at. Karana sets up a second house in a cave to hide from them. One day, however, an Aleut girl discovers Karana by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) house. Though Karana is wary and suspicious of the girl, whose name is Tutok, the two eventually become close friends. They exchange gifts and talk by the fire -LRB-though they do not speak the same language-RRB-. When the Aleuts have finished hunting, the girl has to go with them, and Karana feels more alone than ever. Karana continues her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) work on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) house, and becomes more and more comfortable on the island. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) makes herself new clothes and befriends a number of other animals, including birds, an otter, and a fox. Years later, when Rontu dies, Karana takes his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) son from the cave of the wild dogs. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tames the dog, and names him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) Rontu-Aru. After her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) long stay on the Island of the Blue Dolphins, another ship comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) harbor. Realizing that it is time for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to leave, and missing human contact, Karana gathers her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) things and, with Rontu-Aru, leaves Ghalas-at.
