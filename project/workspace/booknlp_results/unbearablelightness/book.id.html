Kundera contrasts Nietzsche's philosophy of eternal return, or of heaviness, with Parmenides's understanding of life as light. Kundera wonders if any meaning or weight can be attributed to life, since there is no eternal return: if man only has the opportunity to try one path, to make one decision, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot return to take a different path, and then compare the two lives. Without the ability to co mpare lives, Kundera argues, we cannot find meaning; where meaning should exist we find only an unbearable weightlessness. The uncertain existence of meaning, and the opposition of lightness and heaviness, the key dichotomy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, sets the stage for the entire novel. The year is 1968. The protagonist, Tomas, a brilliant Prague surgeon, pursues a philosophy of lightness in his (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) erotic adventures and exploits. Briefly married in the past, he (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) neither sees nor wishes to see his (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) ex-wife or young son and is comfortably established as a perpetual bachelor. He (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) meets Tereza, a caf√© waitress in a town he (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) visits, and realizes when she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) follows him (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) to Prague that she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) intends to <div class="bookquote">``offer him (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) up her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) life.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A determined libertine, he (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) momentarily resists his (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) budding roma ntic feelings for her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>), then gives in to his (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) love. Tereza had been living a frustrated life as a waitress in a small town, and dreamed of escaping, especially from her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) vulgar mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) recognizes in Tomas an intellectual and dreamer, and falls in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) instantly. The two live together, but Tomas is unable to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) mistresses. For a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) hides his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) infidelity from Teresa. Eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) admits to it, but claims that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) sexuality is entirely separate from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>). Tereza, unable to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) behavior or adopt a light attitud e towards sex, suffers increasingly from nightmares, and contemplates suicide. To keep Tereza happy, Tomas marries her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) mistresses, however, including his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) closest friend and long-term lover Sabina, a beautiful, reckless, and talented painter. In spite of herself, Tereza is charmed by Sabina's openness and light-heartedness, and the two women grow friendly. Sabina finds Tereza a job in Prague as a photographer. Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) friendship with Sabina, however, Tereza's jealousy of Tomas does not slacken. The events of the Prague Spring result in the Soviet military occupation of the city. Tomas, who in the past wrote an article condemning the Czech Communists, is warned to leave. Sabina flees first, and later Tomas and Tereza join her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) in Switzerland. Tereza, who found some fulfillment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) job as photographer in Prague, realizes that in Zurich she (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) is jobless and must sit at home while Tomas continues having affairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) decides that <div class="bookquote">``when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and returns to Prague. Tomas attempts to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) newly recovered freedom for a few days, then gives up and returns to Prague and Tereza. The return truly means giving up freedom--there is no chance that the couple will be allo wed to leave again. In Prague, Tomas's political troubles escalate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) position as surgeon for refusing to sign a denunciation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) anti-Communist article. Both the Communist regime and underground dissidents attempt to seduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) to their side. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) own son reappears as a young dissident and preaches to Tomas with no success, for Tomas hates the idea of being used politically in the same way Sabina hates artistic kitsch. In the end, Tomas seeks obscurity in a job washing windows. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) fame persists, however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) continues seducing the women he (<font color='blue'><b>Tomas</b></font>) works for. Tereza, now a bartender, in a moment of desperation has an affair with a tall engineer who comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) bar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) does so in hopes of coming closer to Tomas's way of life; instead she (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) grows more miserable and becomes convinced the man was a police agent hired to gather potential blackmailing material. After many scenes and nightmares, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) convinces Tomas to move with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) to the country. This means giving up their way of life entirely, and an end to Tomas's erotic adventures. After living peacefully in the country for some time, Tomas and Tereza are killed one night in a driving accident; they die instantly and together. In Geneva, Sabina has a love affair with Franz, a university professor and idealistic intellectual who has more in common emotionally with Tereza than Sabina--he (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) imbues his (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) life with heavy meaning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) views Sabina as a romantic and courageous Czech dissident, and is tortured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) must betray his (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) wife Marie-Claude in order to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>). Sabina loves Franz but their views on betrayal differ dramatically; whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) hates the idea of betrayal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) views betrayal as the first step towards <div class="bookquote">``going off into the unknown,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the most glorious thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) can think of. When Franz leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) wife and expects to move in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>), Sabina abruptly leaves Switzerland. Sabina leaves Geneva for Paris and then Paris for America; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) learns of Tomas and Tereza's deaths from a letter and understands her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) last link to the past has been broken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) ends up living with an elderly American couple and wondering if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) has reached the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) perpetual flight. Franz remains separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) wife. After Sabina's betrayal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) finds consolation with a young student, a girl in over-sized glasses who loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) simply. Franz never accepts that he (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) clearly misunderstood Sabina, but continues to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) image as in ideal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) head, -LRB-wrongly-RRB- thinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) decisions in life would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sabina</b></font>) proud. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) death, his (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) wife reclaims Franz's body and orders the words <div class="bookquote">``A return after long wanderings''  (<font color='red'><b>Franz</b></font>)</div>written on his (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) tombstone.
