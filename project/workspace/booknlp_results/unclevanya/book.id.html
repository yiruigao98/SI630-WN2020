Marina, an old nanny, sits by a samovar as Astrov, the country doctor, reminisces about the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) first came to the region, a time when Vera Petrovna--Serebryakov's first wife and mother to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) daughter Sonya--was still alive. Serebryakov has recently returned with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) beautiful young wife, Yelena, to live on the estate; Astrov has come to treat the Professor's case of gout. Astrov delivers an extended speech about how life has become <div class="bookquote">``boring, stupid, sordid''  (<font color='red'><b>Astrov</b></font>)</div>and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) feelings are <div class="bookquote">``dead to the world'' (<font color='red'><b>Astrov</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) needs nothing, wants nothing, and loves no one. Voynitsky -LRB-or Uncle Vanya-RRB-, Serebryakov's brother-in-law by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanya</b></font>) first marriage and caretaker of the estate, then enters, yawning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vanya</b></font>) complains that the professor and his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) wife have thrown the estate out of kilter: everyone has succumbed to lethargy. When Astrov reproaches Voynitsky for his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) ill humor, Voynitsky replies that Voynitsky has grown old and lazy, having wasted his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) entire life. For many years Voynitsky--who once worshipped the professor--has sent the farm's proceeds to the professor, while reserving only a beggar's salary for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) now considers the professor a charlatan. When Astrov remarks that Voynitsky seems to envy Serebryakov, he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) readily concurs, in particular when it comes to his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) success with women. Sonya, Yelena, and Maria Vasilevna -LRB-Voynitsky's mother-RRB- join the party. Astrov invites Yelena and Sonya to his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) forest preserve. Though admitting that perhaps only an <div class="bookquote">``eccentric''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>could think thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) then decries man's impulse to destroy, extolling the beauty of nature and man's capacity leave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legacy to future generations. Yelena and Voynitsky then walk to the veranda. Voynitsky protests Yelena's marriage and suddenly attempts to declare his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) rejects him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wholeheartedly. Act II takes place at night with the professor and Yelena sitting next to each other in the dining room, asleep. A night watchman can be heard tapping in the garden. The two awaken, and Serebryakov complains of his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) old age. He (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) has spent his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) life in scholarship only to end up in <div class="bookquote">``exile.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Voynitsky arrives to relieve Yelena: the professor reacts in terror. Marina enters and tenderly takes Serebryakov to bed, leaving Yelena and Voynitsky alone. Much to Yelena's dismay, Voynitsky resumes his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) attempts at seduction. When Yelena recoils, he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) once again decries the years he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) has wasted; Yelena is numb to his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) entreaty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) leaves, and Voynitsky delivers a soliloquy that imagines what could have been had they married when they first met. Some disconcerting comic relief ensues involving a tipsy Astrov and guitar-playing Telegin -LRB-an impoverished landowner dubbed <div class="bookquote">``Waffles''  (<font color='red'><b>an landowner</b></font>)</div>for his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) pockmarked face-RRB-. Once Voynitsky has exited, Sonya, who has entered the room in the meantime, converses with the brooding Astrov. The doctor moans that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cannot love but is <div class="bookquote">``fascinated''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by beauty -LRB-namely Yelena's-RRB-. When Sonya hypothetically asks him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would do if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) knew someone who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) answers that could not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) in return. Once alone, Sonya confesses her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) love for Astrov. Yelena then enters. The two women suddenly exclaim that they must reconcile--apparently they had been at odds since Yelena married Sonya's father even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) does not love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Inexplicably, Sonya begins laughing, exclaiming that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) is happy. Yelena impulsively decides to play the piano, and Sonya rushes out to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) father's permission. Unfortunately it is withheld. Act III opens in the house drawing room with Voynitsky and Sonya seated as Yelena paces about. The professor has called a meeting. Sonya criticizes Yelena's <div class="bookquote">``infectious''  (<font color='red'><b>Yelena</b></font>)</div>idleness for causing everyone to desert his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) work. Yelena is enraged: Voynitsky offers to pick her (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) a bouquet of roses. Once Voynitsky exits, Sonya expresses her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) anguish over the doctor anew, and Yelena resolves to find out if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>). After Sonya runs to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), Yelena, now alone, confesses her (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) own fascination for Astrov. Astrov then enters with a cartogram and proceeds to explain the progressive degeneration of the region to an uninterested Yelena. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) breaks off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) cross-examines him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) with regards to Sonya. It indeed turns out that Astrov does not love Sonya. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is, however, convinced of Yelena's own desire for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). Passionately he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) embraces her (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) and insists upon arranging a rendezvous. Yelena momentarily relents; suddenly, however, Voynitsky enters, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) disengages herself from Astrov's arms. Voynitsky is quite disturbed. Finally the other members of the household appear in the drawing room. Serebryakov announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) plans to sell the estate. Voynitsky is livid, protesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has spent his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) best years working the land to the professor's benefit. Ominously Voynitsky storms out, and Yelena and Serebryakov both go after him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). Suddenly a shot rings out off-stage. Serebryakov runs in; Voynitsky appears and fires a second shot. After a pause, it becomes clear he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has missed twice. Dejected, Voynitsky tosses the revolver to the ground and sinks into a chair. Act IV is set in Voynitsky's bedroom/estate office. Telegin and Marina sit winding stocking wool. Through their conversation, we learn that Yelena and the professor are departing that evening. Voynitsky and Astrov then enter, the latter asking Vanya to return a stolen bottle of morphine. Voynitsky declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vanya</b></font>) is now nothing but a madman. For Astrov, Voynitsky is not mad but <div class="bookquote">``eccentric'' (<font color='red'><b>Voynitsky</b></font>)</div>--such is the <div class="bookquote">``normal condition''  (<font color='red'><b>Voynitsky</b></font>)</div>of man. Dreading the empty years to come, Voynitsky begs Astrov to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) start a new life. Annoyed, Astrov tells him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can do nothing: the provinces have poisoned them both. Sonya then enters, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) pleads with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Voynitsky surrenders the bottle. Yelena appears and informs Voynitsky that her (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) husband has sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) father to reconcile with the professor, Sonya exits with him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>). Yelena and Astrov say their subdued goodbyes. The doctor makes one more attempt to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) to stay: Yelena declines. Astrov remarks that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is certain that had she (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) remained, great <div class="bookquote">``devastation''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>would ensue. The other members of the household appear. Apparently Serebryakov and Voynitsky have reconciled. <div class="bookquote">``Everyone will be just as it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>the professor</b></font>)</div>the latter murmurs grimly to the professor. Yelena and an apologetic Voynitsky share a brief farewell, Voynitsky telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yelena</b></font>) will never see him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) again. Terribly depressed, Voynitsky and Sonya return to their long-deferred work. Shortly thereafter Astrov departs as well. Voynitsky then turns to Sonya, bemoaning his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) misery. Sonya tells him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) that they must endure their trials and wait for death. Laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) lap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) conjures a vision of the heaven; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) uncle weeps. The play closes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) repeated refrain <div class="bookquote">``We shall rest we shall rest!''
