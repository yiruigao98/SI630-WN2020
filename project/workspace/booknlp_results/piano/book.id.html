A 137-year-old, upright piano, decorated with totems in the manner of African sculpture, dominates the parlor. The play opens at dawn. Boy Willie, Doaker's nephew, knocks at the door and enters with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) partner, Lymon. Two have come from Mississippi to sell watermelons. Willie has not seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) sister Berniece, who lives with Doaker, for three years as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) has been serving a sentence on the Parchman Prison Farm. Willie asks his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) uncle for a celebratory drink: the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog have drowned Sutter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutter</b></font>) own well. Willie intends to sell the family piano and use the money to buy Sutter's land, the land his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutter</b></font>) ancestors once worked as slaves. Doaker, however, is sure Berniece will not part with the piano. Indeed, Avery Brown--a preacher who has been courting Berniece since her (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) husband Crawley died--has already tried to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) to sell it. Willie schemes to get in touch with the prospective buyer himself. Suddenly Berniece cries out off-stage, <div class="bookquote">``Go on get away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Berniece</b></font>)</div>Berniece claims she (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) has seen Sutter's ghost, calling Boy Willie's name. She (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) is convinced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) brother pushed Sutter into the well. Shaken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) refuses to cooperate with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutter</b></font>) plans. Three days later, Doaker's brother Wining Boy, a wandering, washed-up recording star, sits at the kitchen table discussing the recent events with the men. Wining Boy mentions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) heard Willie and Lymon were on Parchman Farm. Willie explains that some whites had tried to chase Willie, Lymon, and Berniece's husband Crawley from some wood they were pilfering. Crawley fought back and was killed while the other two went to prison. The men reminisce about Parchman and sing an old work song. Doaker then explains the piano's history to Lymon. During slavery, a man named Robert Sutter, the recently deceased-Sutter's grandfather, owned the Charles family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wanted to make an anniversary present out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) friend's piano but could not afford it. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) traded a full and half grown slave--Doaker's grandmother Berniece and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father--for the instrument. Though initially Sutter's wife loved the piano, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eventually came to miss her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slaves, falling desperately ill. So, Sutter asked Doaker's grandfather, Willie Boy, to carve the faces of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) wife and child into the piano. Willie Boy did not only carve his (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) immediately family, however, but included his (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) mother, father, and various scenes from the family history. Years after slavery, Berniece and Boy Willie's father, Boy Charles, developed an obsession over the piano, believing that as long as the Sutters held it, they held the family in bondage. Thus, on July 4, 1911, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), Doaker, and Wining Boy stole it. Later that day, lynchers set Boy Charles's house on fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) fled to catch the Yellow Dog, but the mob stopped the train and set his (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) boxcar on fire. Boy Charles died along with the hobos in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) car, all of whom became the ghosts of the railroad. Once Doaker has finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) story, Willie and Lymon attempt to move the piano. Berniece enters and commands Willie to stop, since the piano is their legacy. Berniece invokes the memory of their mother, who attended to the piano until the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) died. She (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) attacks Boy Willie for perpetuating the endless theft and murder in their family, blaming him (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) for the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) husband. Suddenly, Maretha, Berniece's daughter, is heard screaming upstairs in terror, as Sutter's ghost has appeared again. The following morning, Wining Boy enters with a suit he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) has been unable to pawn. Shrewdly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) sells his (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) suit to Lymon, promising that it has a magical effect on the ladies. Lymon and Boy Willie plan to go out the local picture show and find some women. Later that evening, Berniece appears preparing a tub for her (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) bath. Avery enters and proposes to Berniece anew. Berniece refuses and wonders why everyone tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) cannot be a woman unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) has a man. Changing the subject, Berniece asks Avery to bless the house in hopes of exorcising Sutter's ghost. Avery suggests that she (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) use the piano to start a choir at his (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) church. Berniece replies that she (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) leaves the piano untouched to keep from waking its spirits. Several hours later, Boy Willie enters the darkened house with Grace, a local girl. They begin to kiss and knock over a lamp. Berniece comes downstairs and orders them out. As Berniece is making tea, Lymon returns, looking for Willie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) is tired of one-night stands and dreams of finding the right woman. Musing on Wining Boy's magic suit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) withdraws a bottle of perfume from his (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) pocket and gives it to Berniece and they kiss. The final scene begins the next day with Willie telling Maretha of the Ghosts of Yellow Dog. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) has already called the buyer about the piano. Berniece enters and once again orders Willie out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) house. They argue anew and Willie invokes the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) father, arguing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) only plans to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) might have done. Willie and Lymon begin to move the piano. Berniece exits and reappears with Crawley's gun. Suddenly a drunken Wining Boy enters, comically breaking the tension of the scene. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) sits down to play a song he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) wrote in memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) wife, shielding the piano from Willie. A knock at the door follows, and Grace enters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) and Lymon have a date for the picture show and suddenly Sutter's presence asserts itself. Grace flees with Lymon, leaving only the members of the Charles family and Avery in the house. Avery moves to bless the piano. Boy Willie intercedes, taunting Sutter as Avery attempts his (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) exorcism. He (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) charges up the stairs, and an unseen force drives him (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) charges back up, and then engages with Sutter in a life-and-death struggle. Suddenly, Berniece realizes what she (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) must do and begins to play the piano. <div class="bookquote">``I want you to help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) sings, naming her (<font color='blue'><b>Berniece</b></font>) ancestors. A calm comes over the house. Willie reappears and asks Wining Boy is he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) is ready to catch the train back south. Willie says goodbye to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) sister, and Berniece gives thanks.
