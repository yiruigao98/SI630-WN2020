the small New England town of Starkfield for the winter, the narrator
sets out to learn about the life of a mysterious local named Ethan
Frome, who had a tragic accident some twenty years earlier. After questioning
various locals with little result, the narrator finally comes to
learn the details of Ethan's <div class="bookquote">``smash-up''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as the locals call it-RRB-
when a violent snowstorm forces the narrator into an overnight stay
at the Frome household. Going back to that tragic year, we find Ethan walking
through snowy Starkfield at midnight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) arrives at the village
church, where lights in the basement reveal a dance. Ethan loiters
by the window, transfixed by the sight of a young girl in a cherry-colored scarf.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) has come to the church to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife's cousin, Mattie Silver,
who has been living with the Fromes for over a year, helping around
the house. Eventually, we learn that Mattie is the girl in the red
scarf--and the object of Ethan's affection. When the dance lets out, Ethan hangs back to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>)
presence unknown. Mattie refuses the offer of a ride from another
young man named Denis Eady and begins the walk home alone. Ethan catches
up with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). As they continue on their way together, Ethan experiences
a sense of thrill in Mattie's presence, and the tension between
the two becomes apparent. However, the tension dissipates when they
arrive home and Zeena, Ethan's sickly, shrewish wife, who has kept
a late-night vigil in anticipation of their return, greets them.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) regards the dynamic between her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cousin with
obvious suspicion, and Ethan goes to bed in a state of unease, without
a word to Zeena and with thoughts only of Mattie. The next day Ethan spends the morning cutting wood and returns
home to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife prepared for a journey. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has decided to
seek treatment for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) illness in a neighboring town, where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will
spend the night with some distant relatives. Excited by the prospect
of an evening alone with Mattie, Ethan quickly assents to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife's
plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) goes into town to make a lumber sale, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hurries so
as to return to Mattie in time for supper. That evening, tensions run high between Ethan and Mattie. Although
the two never consummate or even verbalize their passions, their
mutual feelings hang palpably between them, unspoiled by the house's
many reminders of the absent Zeena. Catastrophe threatens when the
cat shatters Zeena's favorite pickle dish, which Mattie had taken
out to celebrate their dinner together, but Ethan quickly pieces
the shards together and tucks the broken dish back in its place.
After supper, with Mattie busy at her (<font color='blue'><b>cat</b></font>) sewing work, Ethan contemplates
an outright demonstration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) affections, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) stops short
of full disclosure. Just after eleven, the two turn in for the night
without so much as touching. The next morning, Ethan remains eager to reveal his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) feelings
to Mattie, but the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hired man, Jotham Powell, coupled with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) own inhibitions, prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) from making a move. Ethan makes
a run into town to pick up some glue for the pickle dish. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>)
arrives back at the farm, expecting to find Mattie alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) informs
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) that Zeena has returned. Quickly collecting himself, Ethan visits
the bedroom to greet his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife. Zeena, however, is in no mood for
kindnesses and bitterly informs Ethan that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) health is failing
rapidly. In light of this fact, Zeena announces, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) plans to replace
Mattie with a more efficient hired girl. Ethan privately resents
Zeena's decision but keeps the bulk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) anger to himself. Going down to the kitchen, Ethan's passions spill over,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) kisses Mattie zealously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) tells Mattie of Zeena's plan
to dismiss her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but their moment together is interrupted by Zeena
herself, who had originally declined to come down to dinner but
has changed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind. After the meal, Zeena discovers the broken
pickle dish while in search of some medicines and, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rage,
grows all the more determined to chase Mattie out. That evening, Ethan retreats to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) makeshift study, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) contemplates the decision that lies before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>). Unable to tolerate Mattie's
dismissal, but effectively unable to prevent it, Ethan briefly considers
eloping with Mattie, and even begins to draft a letter of farewell
to Zeena. However, in a sober evaluation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) financial situation,
Ethan comes to realize the impossibility of running away and falls
asleep in a state of hopelessness. At breakfast the next morning, Zeena announces the day's
plans for Mattie's departure and the arrival of the new hired girl.
At mid-morning, having finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) tasks on the farm, Ethan steals
into town on a desperate errand. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) plan, hatched on the fly, is
to make a second attempt to collect an advance from Andrew Hale
on a recently delivered lumber load, in hopes of financing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) elopement with
Mattie after all. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) way down the hill Ethan encounters the Hale
sleigh, and, in passing, Hale's wife praises him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) greatly for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) patience
in caring for the ailing Zeena. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kind words serve to check his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>)
plan, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) returns to the farm with a guilty conscience. Against Zeena's wishes, Ethan decides to bring Mattie
to the station himself. In a fit of nostalgia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) takes her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by a
roundabout route, and they eventually end up stopping at the crest
of a village hill in order to take a sledding adventure they had
once proposed but had never undertaken. A successful first run prompts
Mattie to suggest a second, but with a different purpose in mind.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asks Ethan to run the sled into the elm tree at the foot of
the hill, allowing them to spend their last moments together. Ethan
initially rejects her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) proposal but is slowly won over, and they
take their positions on the sled, locking themselves in a final
embrace. In the wake of the collision, Ethan comes to consciousness
dazedly, reaching out to feel the face of the softly moaning Mattie,
who opens her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes and weakly utters his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) name. Jumping forward twenty years, we find ourselves back in
the company of the narrator as he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) enters the Frome household. Inside, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)
meets the gaze of two frail and aging women, and takes stock of the
house's squalid conditions. Frome apologizes for the lack of heat in
the house and introduces the narrator to the woman preparing their
supper--his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife, Zeena--and to the seated, paralyzed woman in the
chair by the fire--Miss Mattie Silver. The next day, the narrator returns to town, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) lodges
with Mrs. Ned Hale and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) mother, Mrs. Varnum. Sensing their curiosity,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) gives a brief account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) evening in the Frome household, and
after supper he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) settles down to a more intimate discussion with Mrs.
Hale. Together, they mourn the tragic plight of the silent, cursed
man and the two women fated to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) company during the long
New England winter nights.
