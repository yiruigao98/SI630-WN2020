a memory play, and its action is drawn from the
memories of the narrator, Tom Wingfield. Tom is a character in the
play, which is set in St. Louis in 1937.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) is an aspiring poet who toils in a shoe warehouse to support
his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) mother, Amanda, and sister, Laura. Mr. Wingfield, Tom and Laura's
father, ran off years ago and, except for one postcard, has not
been heard from since. Amanda, originally from a genteel Southern family, regales
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) children frequently with tales of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) idyllic youth and the
scores of suitors who once pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) is disappointed that
Laura, who wears a brace on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) leg and is painfully shy, does not
attract any gentlemen callers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) enrolls Laura in a business college,
hoping that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own and the family's fortune through
a business career. Weeks later, however, Amanda discovers that Laura's crippling
shyness has led her (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) to drop out of the class secretly and spend
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) days wandering the city alone. Amanda then decides that Laura's
last hope must lie in marriage and begins selling magazine subscriptions
to earn the extra money she (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) believes will help to attract suitors
for Laura. Meanwhile, Tom, who loathes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) warehouse job, finds
escape in liquor, movies, and literature, much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother's chagrin.
During one of the frequent arguments between mother and son, Tom
accidentally breaks several of the glass animal figurines that are
Laura's most prized possessions. Amanda and Tom discuss Laura's prospects, and Amanda
asks Tom to keep an eye out for potential suitors at the warehouse.
Tom selects Jim O'Connor, a casual friend, and invites him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to dinner. Amanda
quizzes Tom about Jim and is delighted to learn that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is a driven
young man with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind set on career advancement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) prepares
an elaborate dinner and insists that Laura wear a new dress. At
the last minute, Laura learns the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) caller; as it turns
out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had a devastating crush on Jim in high school. When Jim
arrives, Laura answers the door, on Amanda's orders, and then quickly
disappears, leaving Tom and Jim alone. Tom confides to Jim that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has used the money for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) family's electric bill to join the merchant
marine and plans to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) job and family in search of adventure.
Laura refuses to eat dinner with the others, feigning illness. Amanda,
wearing an ostentatious dress from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) glamorous youth, talks vivaciously
with Jim throughout the meal. As dinner is ending, the lights go out as a consequence
of the unpaid electric bill. The characters light candles, and Amanda encourages
Jim to entertain Laura in the living room while she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) and Tom clean
up. Laura is at first paralyzed by Jim's presence, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) warm
and open behavior soon draws her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) shell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) confesses
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) knew and liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) in high school but was too shy to approach
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). They continue talking, and Laura reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) of the nickname
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Blue Roses,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>an accidental corruption of pleurosis,
an illness Laura had in high school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) reproaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) shyness and low self-esteem but praises her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) uniqueness. Laura
then ventures to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) favorite glass animal, a unicorn.
Jim dances with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), but in the process, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) accidentally knocks over
the unicorn, breaking off its horn. Laura is forgiving, noting that
now the unicorn is a normal horse. Jim then kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) quickly
draws back and apologizes, explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was carried away by
the moment and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) actually has a serious girlfriend. Resigned,
Laura offers him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) the broken unicorn as a souvenir. Amanda enters the living room, full of good cheer. Jim
hastily explains that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) must leave because of an appointment with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) fianc√©e. Amanda sees him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) off warmly but, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) is gone, turns
on Tom, who had not known that Jim was engaged. Amanda accuses Tom
of being an inattentive, selfish dreamer and then throws herself into
comforting Laura. From the fire escape outside of their apartment,
Tom watches the two women and explains that, not long after Jim's
visit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) gets fired from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) job and leaves Amanda and Laura behind.
Years later, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) travels far, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) finds that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) is unable to leave
behind guilty memories of Laura.
