social ills plague both France and England. Jerry Cruncher, an odd-job man
who works for Tellson's Bank, stops the Dover mail-coach with an urgent
message for Jarvis Lorry. The message instructs Lorry to wait at
Dover for a young woman, and Lorry responds with the cryptic words,
<div class="bookquote">``Recalled to Life.''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>At Dover, Lorry is met by Lucie Manette, a young
orphan whose father, a once-eminent doctor whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) supposed dead,
has been discovered in France. Lorry escorts Lucie to Paris, where
they meet Defarge, a former servant of Doctor Manette, who has kept
Manette safe in a garret. Driven mad by eighteen years in the Bastille,
Manette spends all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) time making shoes, a hobby he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) learned
while in prison. Lorry assures Lucie that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love and devotion
can recall her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father to life, and indeed they do. The year is now 1780.
Charles Darnay stands accused of treason against the English crown.
A bombastic lawyer named Stryver pleads Darnay's case, but it is
not until his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) drunk, good-for-nothing colleague, Sydney Carton,
assists him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) that the court acquits Darnay. Carton clinches his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) argument
by pointing out that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) himself bears an uncanny resemblance to
the defendant, which undermines the prosecution's case for unmistakably
identifying Darnay as the spy the authorities spotted. Lucie and
Doctor Manette watched the court proceedings, and that night, Carton
escorts Darnay to a tavern and asks how it feels to receive the
sympathy of a woman like Lucie. Carton despises and resents Darnay
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) himself has given up and might
have been. In France, the cruel Marquis Evrémonde runs down a plebian child
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) carriage. Manifesting an attitude typical of the aristocracy
in regard to the poor at that time, the Marquis shows no regret,
but instead curses the peasantry and hurries home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) chateau,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) awaits the arrival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nephew, Darnay, from England.
Arriving later that night, Darnay curses his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) uncle and the French
aristocracy for its abominable treatment of the people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) renounces
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) identity as an Evrémonde and announces his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) intention to return
to England. That night, the Marquis is murdered; the murderer has
left a note signed with the nickname adopted by French revolutionaries:
<div class="bookquote">``Jacques.''  (<font color='red'><b>revolutionaries</b></font>)</div>A year passes, and Darnay asks Manette for permission
to marry Lucie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) says that, if Lucie accepts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) will reveal his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
true identity to Manette. Carton, meanwhile, also pledges his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) love
to Lucie, admitting that, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) life is worthless, she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) has
helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) dream of a better, more valuable existence. On the streets
of London, Jerry Cruncher gets swept up in the funeral procession
for a spy named Roger Cly. Later that night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) demonstrates his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
talents as a <div class="bookquote">``Resurrection-Man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>sneaking into the cemetery to steal
and sell Cly's body. In Paris, meanwhile, another English spy known
as John Barsad drops into Defarge's wine shop. Barsad hopes to turn
up evidence concerning the mounting revolution, which is still in
its covert stages. Madame Defarge sits in the shop knitting a secret
registry of those whom the revolution seeks to execute. Back in
London, Darnay, on the morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) wedding, keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) promise
to Manette; he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) reveals his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) true identity and, that night, Manette
relapses into his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) old prison habit of making shoes. After nine days,
Manette regains his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) presence of mind, and soon joins the newlyweds
on their honeymoon. Upon Darnay's return, Carton pays him (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) a visit
and asks for his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) friendship. Darnay assures Carton that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) is always
welcome in their home. The year is now 1789.
The peasants in Paris storm the Bastille and the French Revolution
begins. The revolutionaries murder aristocrats in the streets, and
Gabelle, a man charged with the maintenance of the Evrémonde estate,
is imprisoned. Three years later, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) writes to Darnay, asking to
be rescued. Despite the threat of great danger to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) person, Darnay
departs immediately for France. As soon as Darnay arrives in Paris, the French revolutionaries arrest
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as an emigrant. Lucie and Manette make their way to Paris in
hopes of saving him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>). Darnay remains in prison for a year and three
months before receiving a trial. In order to help free him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), Manette
uses his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) considerable influence with the revolutionaries, who sympathize
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) for having served time in the Bastille. Darnay receives
an acquittal, but that same night he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) is arrested again. The charges,
this time, come from Defarge and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) vengeful wife. Carton arrives
in Paris with a plan to rescue Darnay and obtains the help of John
Barsad, who turns out to be Solomon Pross, the long-lost brother
of Miss Pross, Lucie's loyal servant. At Darnay's trial, Defarge produces a letter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) discovered
in Manette's old jail cell in the Bastille. The letter explains
the cause of Manette's imprisonment. Years ago, the brothers Evrémonde
-LRB-Darnay's father and uncle-RRB- enlisted Manette's medical assistance.
They asked him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had
raped, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally.
Fearing that Manette might report their misdeeds, the Evrémondes
had him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Darnay for
the crimes of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ancestors and sentences him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to die within twenty-four
hours. That night, at the Defarge's wine shop, Carton overhears
Madame Defarge plotting to have Lucie and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter -LRB-also Darnay's
daughter-RRB- executed as well; Madame Defarge, it turns out, is the
surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evrémondes.
Carton arranges for the Manettes' immediate departure from France.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then visits Darnay in prison, tricks him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into changing clothes
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
friend unconscious. Barsad carries Darnay, now disguised as Carton,
to an awaiting coach, while Carton, disguised as Darnay, awaits
execution. As Darnay, Lucie, their child, and Dr. Manette speed
away from Paris, Madame Defarge arrives at Lucie's apartment, hoping
to arrest her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). There she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finds the supremely protective Miss Pross.
A scuffle ensues, and Madame Defarge dies by the bullet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own
gun. Sydney Carton meets his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) death at the guillotine, and the narrator
confidently asserts that Carton dies with the knowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
has finally imbued his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) life with meaning.
