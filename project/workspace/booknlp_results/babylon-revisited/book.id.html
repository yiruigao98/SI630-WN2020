Charlie asks Alix to pass along his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) brother-in-law's address to Duncan Schaeffer. The narrator says that Paris and the Ritz bar feel deserted. Charlie says he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has been sober for a year and a half and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is now a businessman living in Prague. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) and Alix gossip about old acquaintances. Charlie says he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s in town to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) daughter. Charlie gets in a taxi. The Left Bank looks provincial to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) wonders whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s ruined the city for himself. The narrator tells us that Charlie is a handsome thirty-five-year-old. Charlie goes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) brother-in-law's house, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) daughter, Honoria, jumps into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) arms. Marion Peters, his (<font color='blue'><b>Peters</b></font>) sister-in-law, greets him (<font color='blue'><b>Peters</b></font>) without warmth, although his (<font color='blue'><b>Peters</b></font>) brother-in-law, Lincoln Peters, is friendlier. In a calculated remark, Charlie boasts about how good his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) finances are these days. Lincoln looks restless, so Charlie changes the subject. Marion says she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>)'s glad there aren't many Americans left in Paris, and it's clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) doesn't like Charlie. After eating dinner with the Peters family, Charlie goes to see a famous dancer named Josephine Baker, then to Montmartre, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) passes nightclubs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) recognizes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sees a few scared tourists go into one club. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) thinks about the meaning of dissipation and remembers the vast sums of money he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) threw away. After ignoring a woman's advances, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) goes home. Part II begins the following morning. Charlie takes Honoria to lunch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) suggests going to a toy store and then to a vaudeville show. Honoria doesn't want to go to the toy store because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s worried they're no longer rich. Charlie playfully introduces himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as if they are strangers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) pretends that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doll is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goes along with the joke. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prefers Lincoln to Marion and asks why she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) can't live with Charlie. Leaving the restaurant, they run into Duncan Schaeffer and Lorraine Quarrles, two of Charlie's friends from the old days. Lorraine says she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) husband are poor now and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) is alone in Paris. They ask Charlie to join them for dinner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) brushes them off and refuses to tell them where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s staying. They see each other again at the vaudeville, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has a drink with them. In the cab on the way home, Honoria says she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) wants to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), which thrills Charlie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) blows him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) a kiss when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) is safely inside the house. In Part III, Charlie meets with Marion and Lincoln. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) wants Honoria to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) drinks one drink per day on purpose so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) doesn't obsess about it ever again. Marion doesn't understand this, but Lincoln claims that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) understands Charlie. Charlie settles in for a long fight, reminding himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) objective isn't to justify his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) behavior but to win Honoria back. Marion says that Charlie hasn't existed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) locked Helen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) sister and Charlie's wife, out of their apartment. Charlie says Marion can trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). As it becomes increasingly clear that Marion simply doesn't like Charlie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) begins to worry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) will turn Honoria against him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) stresses that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) will be able to give Honoria a good life and then realizes that Marion and Lincoln don't want to hear about how much wealthier he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) is than they are. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) craves a drink. The narrator says that Marion understands Charlie's wish to be with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) daughter but needs to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) as the villain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) implies that Charlie was responsible for Helen's death. Lincoln objects. Charlie says that heart trouble killed Helen, and Marion sarcastically agrees with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). Suddenly giving up the fight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) leaves the room. Lincoln tells Charlie that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) can take Honoria. Back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hotel room, Charlie thinks of the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) and Helen destroyed their love for no good reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) remembers the night they fought and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) kissed another man; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) got home before her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) and locked her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) out. There was a snowstorm later, and Helen wandered around in the cold. The incident marked the <div class="bookquote">``beginning of the end.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie falls asleep and dreams of Helen, who says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) and Honoria to be together. Part IV begins the next morning. Charlie interviews two potential governesses and then eats lunch with Lincoln. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) says Marion resents the fact that Charlie and Helen were spending a fortune while she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) and Lincoln were just scraping along. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hotel room, Charlie gets a pneumatique -LRB-a letter delivered by pneumatic tube-RRB- from Lorraine, who reminisces about their drunken pranks and asks to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) at the Ritz bar. The adventures that Lorraine looks back on with fondness strike Charlie as nightmarish. Charlie goes to Marion and Lincoln's house in the afternoon. Honoria has been told of the decision and is delighted. The room feels safe and warm. The doorbell rings--it is Lorraine and Duncan, who are drunk. Slurring their words, they ask Charlie to dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) refuses twice and they leave angry. Furious, Marion leaves the room. The children eat dinner, and Lincoln goes to check on Marion. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) comes back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) tells Charlie that the plans have changed. In Part V, Charlie goes to the Ritz bar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sees Paul, a bartender he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) knew in the old days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) thinks of the fights that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) and Helen had, the people out of their minds on alcohol and drugs, and the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) locked Helen out in the snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) calls Lincoln, who says that for six months, they have to drop the question of Honoria living with Charlie. Charlie goes back to the bar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) realizes that the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) can do for Honoria is buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) things, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) knows is inadequate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) plans to come back and try again.
