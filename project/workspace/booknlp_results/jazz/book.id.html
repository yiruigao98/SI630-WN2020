Violet and Joe are unhappily married and living together in an apartment in Harlem when Joe falls in love with a seventeen-year old girl named Dorcas. Joe and Dorcas meet when Joe comes to Dorcas's aunt's house to sell ladies cosmetics, and their affair lasts from October of 1925 to the first of January 1926. Joe talks with Malvonne, an upstairs neighbor, and negotiates the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) empty apartment so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and Dorcas can meet there. This arrangement continues for several months and neither Violet nor Alice Manfred, Dorcas's aunt, have any knowledge of the affair. Although Joe brings Dorcas presents every time they meet, eventually Dorcas begins to get tired of the older man and starts going out with younger boys, attending parties with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) best friend Felice, and making up excuses so as not to meet with Joe. When Joe finally confronts Dorcas about this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) cruelly tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) sick and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) should not bother her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) any more. Dorcas prefers the attentions of a popular and good-looking young man named Acton, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) dances at a party on New Year's Day. Dorcas knows that Joe has not gotten over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) and will come looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) is only half-surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) tracks her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) down at the party and sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) dancing with Acton. Joe, however, brings a gun and shoots Dorcas in the shoulder. Dorcas tells the alarmed witnesses not to call an ambulance, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) would survive if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) allowed someone to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) consequently bleeds to death. Everyone knows that Joe shot Dorcas and rumor of their affair begins to spread in the community after the young girl's death. Violet appears unexpectedly at Dorcas' open-casket funeral and slashes Dorcas's face with a knife. Several weeks later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) begins to visit Dorcas's mourning aunt, Alice Manfred, and the two women begin to develop a friendship as a result of their shared tragedy. In the spring, Joe mourns Dorcas's death and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and Violet patch things up in their relationship, mediated in part by their new friendship with Dorcas's best friend, Felice. As the narrator tells the story of Violet, Joe, and Dorcas in Harlem she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) follows a stream of associations and digressive details to create a complex web of people, places, and stories extending back to the late nineteenth century. Violet grew up in a poor household in Virginia with her (<font color='blue'><b>Violet</b></font>) mother Rose Dear. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Violet</b></font>) grandmother, True Belle, came from Baltimore to live with them when Violet's father abandoned the family. Soon afterwards Violet's mother, Rose Dear, committed suicide by throwing herself into a well. Joe also grew up in Virginia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was orphaned at birth and raised by adoptive parents. As a young man he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wondered about his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) birth mother's identity and tied on several occasions to find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mentor, a hunter named Henry LesTroy and called <div class="bookquote">``Hunters Hunter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry LesTroy</b></font>)</div>hinted to Joe that his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mother was the local mystery, a crazy homeless rover named Wild. When Joe finally tracked Wild down in the woods he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to confirm somehow that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was indeed his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mother. Wild responded with a hand gesture that Joe could not make out, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to question his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) own identity. Joe and Violet met in a town called Palestine where they were working the fields. They got married and moved to Harlem, which is referred to simply as <div class="bookquote">``the City''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>throughout the novel. In the course of telling Joe and Violet's story, the narrator recounts the stories of periphery characters such as Vera Louise Gray and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) son Golden Gray. The narrator shows the connections between the characters, focusing on the perspectives and experiences of individuals and sometimes allowing them to narrate their stories in their own words. Golden Gray, the mixed race child of a white woman, Vera Louise, and a black slave, Henry LesTroy, was raised by his (<font color='blue'><b>LesTroy</b></font>) mother and True Belle in Baltimore. He (<font color='blue'><b>LesTroy</b></font>) believed all his (<font color='blue'><b>LesTroy</b></font>) life that he (<font color='blue'><b>LesTroy</b></font>) was a white adopted orphan, but when True Belle told him (<font color='blue'><b>LesTroy</b></font>) the truth about his (<font color='blue'><b>LesTroy</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>LesTroy</b></font>) set out for Virginia to confront Henry LesTroy. When he (<font color='blue'><b>LesTroy</b></font>) arrived near Vienna, Virginia, Golden Gray spotted Wild hiding alongside the road. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned quickly and knocked herself unconscious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) decided to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) father's home. Wild was very pregnant and gave birth to Joe when they arrived at Henry LesTroy's house. Golden Gray never returned to Baltimore after this incident but lived with Wild in the woods, totally apart from civilization. These stories about Harlem and Virginia are recapitulated and fleshed out several times throughout the novel in flashbacks and digressions.
