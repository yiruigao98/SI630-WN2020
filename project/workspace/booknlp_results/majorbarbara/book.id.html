Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) son, Stephen enters. Britomart aggressively announces that as a grown man, Stephen must take charge of the family affairs. Lomax, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lomax</b></font>) sister Sarah's fianc√©, will not receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Lomax</b></font>) trust fund for years. Barbara, the most promising member of the household, has joined the Salvation Army and taken up with a tempestuous Greek scholar, Adolphus Cusins. Britomart cannot avoid the topic any longer--they must speak of Stephen's father, the great military industrialist Andrew Undershaft. Long ago, the foundling Undershaft, in the tradition of the Undershaft armory, disinherited Stephen to find a foundling as his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) successor. Britomart divorced him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) as a result. Now Britomart has invited Andrew to visit this evening to ask for money. Britomart summons the family to the library and inform them of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) plans. Barbara is amused and expectant. After all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) father has a soul to be saved like everyone else. Undershaft arrives. Failing to recognize Stephen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) greets Lomax and then Cusins as his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) son before realizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) error. Undershaft asks Barbara about her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) work at the Salvation Army. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) notes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) firm could easily share the Army's motto: Blood and Fire. After some heated discussion, Barbara and Undershaft strike a bargain. Undershaft will visit Barbara's shelter and Barbara his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) factory, as each will attempt to convert the other to their cause. It is a cold morning in the West Ham shelter of the Salvation Army. Two diners at the lunch table speak animatedly. The sly, young Snobby Price and hard- worn, middle-aged Rummy Mitchens joke about life at the shelter. Suddenly Bill Walker, a rough young man, appears and assaults Jenny Hill, a young Salvation worker. Apparently Bill has come to reclaim a girlfriend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) who recently converted. Rummy runs to Jenny's aid, and Bill cracks her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) across the face. Barbara enters briskly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) berates Bill under he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) is near-tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) asks how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) could have struck a girl. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) wants his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) girl, Barbara informs him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) has joined the Army post in Canningtown and taken up with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) own converts. Bill is crushed. Undershaft arrives and sits to watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) daughter's work. Barbara continues her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) campaign for Bill's soul. Just as Bill is about to break down, a drum is heard in the shelter, and Cusins enters. Bill departs for Canningtown. Barbara returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) work, leaving Cusins to explain the shelter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) father. Presenting himself as a <div class="bookquote">``collector of religions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cusins</b></font>)</div>Cusins asks into Undershaft's faith. Undershaft believes that two things are necessary to salvation: Money and Gunpowder. Love, truth, and mercy are the graces of a <div class="bookquote">``rich, strong, and safe life.''  (<font color='red'><b>Undershaft</b></font>)</div>Undershaft insists that they together must convert Barbara to his (<font color='blue'><b>collector</b></font>) cause. Undershaft plans to demonstrate his (<font color='blue'><b>collector</b></font>) power over the Army in his (<font color='blue'><b>collector</b></font>) effort to win Barbara over. The denizens of the shelter return. Barbara laments the Army's poverty. Bill returns from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) excursion defeated, and Jenny expresses her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sympathy. Bill refuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) forgiveness and offers to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) to square their debt. Barbara forbids Jenny from even taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) money for the Army. Mrs. Baines, an Army Commissioner, then enters and announces a miracle. The Lord Saxmundham has promised the Army five thousand pounds if five other gentleman will give one thousand each to make it ten. To Barbara's dismay, Undershaft promises to help them meet Saxmundham's condition. Gladly Baines takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) father's blood money. <div class="bookquote">``Wot prawce selvytion nah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill</b></font>)</div>scoffs Bill in an aside to Barbara. Overtaken by this <div class="bookquote">``ecstasy of mischief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Undershaft</b></font>)</div>Cusins cheers Undershaft. The group makes ready for a triumphant procession through the streets. Barbara refuses to join them, pinning her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) silver <div class="bookquote">``S''  (<font color='red'><b>Barbara</b></font>)</div>brooch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) father's collar. The next day the family appears preparing for their visit to Undershaft's cannon works. Barbara has shed her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) Army uniform. Undershaft then enters and before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has time to breathe, Britomart raises the topic of Stephen's inheritance. Undershaft protests that tradition demands Stephen's dispossession. The firm needs a man without relations or education, a man who would be out of the running if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were not strong. If Britomart wants the foundry in the family, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) should find a foundling to marry Barbara. The group moves to Perivale St. Andrews, a beautiful <div class="bookquote">``smokeless town of white walls''  (<font color='red'><b>Perivale St. Andrews town</b></font>)</div>lying between two Middlesex hills. Cusins reports that everything in the city is perfect: the town hall, libraries, insurance fund, pension fund, and onward. Lady Britomart arrives from town and chastises Andrew for keeping the foundry to himself all these years. Adolphus must inherit the business. Undershaft reminds her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) that Cusins is no foundling. Cusins then makes a shocking confession, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) has lied about his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) birth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) parents' marriage is only legal in Australia, his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) mother being his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) father's deceased wife's sister. Undershaft accepts Cusins but insists that he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) commit himself to the true faith of the Armorer, which is to give arms to all men who offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) an honest price, nationality, faith, and cause notwithstanding. Cusins refuses and dismisses his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``morality mongering,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cusins</b></font>)</div>while Undershaft asks Barbara to tell Cusins what power really means. Barbara confesses that up until yesterday she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) believed herself in the power of God, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) father revealed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) was in the power of Bodger and Undershaft. Undershaft urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) to scrap a morality and religion that no longer fit the facts as she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) would with old machinery. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has redeemed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) people's--and family's--souls by providing for them. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has saved them from the worst of crimes: the <div class="bookquote">``crime of poverty.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Work, food, shelter, and clothing save--not the Bible. One should not preach at poverty but kill it. Only violence inaugurates the new. The history of the world is the history of those who courageously embrace this truth. Cusins agrees to Undershaft's terms. The group leaves Barbara and Cusins alone. Cusins does not regret the sale of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) soul as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has sold it <div class="bookquote">``for reality and for power.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants to <div class="bookquote">``make power for the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>to provide a power <div class="bookquote">``simple enough for common men to use yet strong enough to force the intellectual oligarchy to use its genius for the general good.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Barbara pledges to stay with Cusins. Now sees the souls saved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) father's community and will return to the Army reborn with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) new knowledge. <div class="bookquote">``Major Barbara will die with the colors,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) cries. The two embrace. Barbara runs to the shed and calls in childlike joy: <div class="bookquote">``Mamma! Mamma! I want Mamma!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Barbara</b></font>)</div></body></html>
