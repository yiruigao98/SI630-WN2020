Her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) mother died when she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) was a young girl, and her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) father raised her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) in a haphazard manner, allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) to educate herself and encouraging her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) independence. As a result, the adult Isabel is widely read, imaginative, confident in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) own mind, and slightly narcissistic; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) has the reputation in Albany for being a formidable intellect, and as a result she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) often seems intimidating to men. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) has had few suitors, but one of them is Caspar Goodwood, the powerful, charismatic son of a wealthy Boston mill owner. Isabel is drawn to Caspar, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) commitment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) independence makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) fear him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) as well, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) feels that to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) would be to sacrifice her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) freedom. Shortly after Isabel's father dies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) receives a visit from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) indomitable aunt, Mrs. Touchett, an American who lives in Europe. Mrs. Touchett offers to take Isabel on a trip to Europe, and Isabel eagerly agrees, telling Caspar that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) cannot tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) wishes to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) until she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) has had at least a year to travel in Europe with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) aunt. Isabel and Mrs. Touchett leave for England, where Mrs. Touchett's estranged husband is a powerful banker. Isabel makes a strong impression on everyone at Mr. Touchett's county manor of Gardencourt: her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) cousin Ralph, slowly dying of a lung disorder, becomes deeply devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>), and the Touchetts' aristocratic neighbor Lord Warburton falls in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>). Warburton proposes, but Isabel declines; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) fears that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) is passing up a great social opportunity by not marrying Warburton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) still believes that marriage would damage her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) treasured independence. As a result, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) pledges to accomplish something wonderful with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) life, something that will justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) decision to reject Warburton. Isabel's friend Henrietta Stackpole, an American journalist, believes that Europe is changing Isabel, slowly eroding her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) American values and replacing them with romantic idealism. Henrietta comes to Gardencourt and secretly arranges for Caspar Goodwood to meet Isabel in London. Goodwood again presses Isabel to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>); this time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) needs at least two years before she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) can answer him (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) promises him (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>) nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) is thrilled to have exercised her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) independence so forcefully. Mr. Touchett's health declines, and Ralph convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) dies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) should leave half his (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) wealth to Isabel: this will protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) independence and ensure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) will never have to marry for money. Mr. Touchett agrees shortly before he (<font color='blue'><b>Touchett</b></font>) dies. Isabel is left with a large fortune for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) inheritance piques the interest of Madame Merle, Mrs. Touchett's polished, elegant friend; Madame Merle begins to lavish attention on Isabel, and the two women become close friends. Isabel travels to Florence with Mrs. Touchett and Madame Merle; Merle introduces Isabel to a man named Gilbert Osmond, a man of no social standing or wealth, but whom Merle describes as one of the finest gentlemen in Europe, wholly devoted to art and aesthetics. Osmond's daughter Pansy is being brought up in a convent; his (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) wife is dead. In secret, Osmond and Merle have a mysterious relationship; Merle is attempting to manipulate Isabel into marrying Osmond so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Merle</b></font>) will have access to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) fortune. Osmond is pleased to marry Isabel, not only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) money, but also because she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) makes a fine addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) collection of art objects. Everyone in Isabel's world disapproves of Osmond, especially Ralph, but Isabel chooses to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) anyway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) has a child the year after they are married, but the boy dies six months after he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is born. Three years into their marriage, Isabel and Osmond have come to despise one another; they live with Pansy in a palazzo in Rome, where Osmond treats Isabel as barely a member of the family: to him (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) is a social hostess and a source of wealth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) is annoyed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) independence and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) insistence on having her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) own opinions. Isabel chafes against Osmond's arrogance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) selfishness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) sinister desire to crush her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) individuality, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) does not consider leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>). For all her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) commitment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) independence, Isabel is also committed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) social duty, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) married Osmond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) did so with the intention of transforming herself into a good wife. A young American art collector who lives in Paris, Edward Rosier, comes to Rome and falls in love with Pansy; Pansy returns his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) feelings. But Osmond is insistent that Pansy should marry a nobleman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) says that Rosier is neither rich nor highborn enough. Matters grow complicated when Lord Warburton arrives on the scene and begins to court Pansy. Warburton is still in love with Isabel and wants to marry Pansy solely to get closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>). But Osmond desperately wants to see Pansy married to Warburton. Isabel is torn about whether to fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) duty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) husband and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) arrange the match between Warburton and Pansy, or to fulfill the impulse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) conscience and discourage Warburton, while helping Pansy find a way to marry Rosier. At a ball one night, Isabel shows Warburton the dejected-looking Rosier and explains that this is the man who is in love with Pansy. Guiltily, Warburton admits that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warburton</b></font>) is not in love with Pansy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Warburton</b></font>) quietly arranges to leave Rome. Osmond is furious with Isabel, convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) is plotting intentionally to humiliate him (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>). Madame Merle is also furious with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>), confronting her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) with shocking impropriety and demanding brazenly to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) did to Warburton. Isabel has realized that there is something mysterious about Madame Merle's relationship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) husband; now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) suddenly realizes that Merle is his (<font color='blue'><b>Merle</b></font>) lover. At this time, Ralph is rapidly deteriorating, and Isabel receives word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) is dying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) longs to travel to England to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>), but Osmond forbids it. Now Isabel must struggle to decide whether to obey his (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) command and remain true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) marriage vows or to disregard him (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) and hurry to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) cousin's bedside. Encouraging her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) to go, Osmond's sister, the Countess Gemini, tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) that there is still more to Merle and Osmond's relationship. Merle is Pansy's mother; Pansy was born out of wedlock. Osmond's wife died at about the same time, so Merle and Osmond spread the story that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) died in childbirth. Pansy was placed in a convent to be raised, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) does not know that Merle is her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) real mother. Isabel is shocked and disgusted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) husband's atrocious behavior--she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) even feels sorry for Merle for falling under his (<font color='blue'><b>Merle</b></font>) spell--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) decides to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) heart and travel to England. After Ralph's death, Isabel struggles to decide whether to return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) husband or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) promised Pansy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) would return to Rome, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) commitment to social propriety impels her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) to go back and honor her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) marriage. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) independent spirit urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) to flee from Osmond and find happiness elsewhere. Caspar Goodwood appears at the funeral, and afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) asks Isabel to run away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Osmond</b></font>) and forget about her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) husband. The next day, unable to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>), Goodwood asks Henrietta where she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) has gone. Henrietta quietly tells him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that Isabel has returned to Rome, unable to break away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) marriage to Gilbert Osmond.
