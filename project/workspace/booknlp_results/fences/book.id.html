Act One is comprised of four scenes and Act Two has five. The play begins on a Friday, Troy and Bono's payday. Troy and Bono go to Troy's house for their weekly ritual of drinking and talking. Troy has asked Mr. Rand, their boss, why the black employees aren't allowed to drive the garbage trucks, only to lift the garbage. Bono thinks Troy is cheating on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bono</b></font>) wife, Rose. Troy and Rose's son, Cory, has been recruited by a college football team. Troy was in the Negro Leagues but never got a chance to play in the Major Leagues because he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) got too old to play just as the Major Leagues began accepting black players. Troy goes into a long epic story about his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) struggle in July of 1943 with death. Lyons shows up at the house because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) knows it is Troy's payday. Rose reminds Troy about the fence she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) to finish building. Cory and Troy work on the fence. Cory breaks the news to Troy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) has given away his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) job at the local grocery store, the A&P, during the football season. Cory begs Troy to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Cory</b></font>) play because a coach from North Carolina is coming all the way to Pittsburgh to see Cory play. Troy refuses and demands Cory to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) job back. Act One, scene four takes place on Friday and mirrors scene one. Troy has won his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) case and has been assigned as the first colored garbage truck driver in the city. Bono and Troy remember their fathers and their childhood experiences of leaving home in the south and moving north. Cory comes home enraged after finding out that Troy told the football coach that Cory may not play on the team. Troy warns Cory that his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) insubordinance is <div class="bookquote">``strike one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cory</b></font>)</div>against him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>). Troy bails his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) brother Gabriel out of jail. Bono and Troy work on the fence. Bono explains to Troy and Cory that Rose wants the fence because she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) family and wants to keep close to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) love. Troy admits to Bono that he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) is having an affair with Alberta. Bono bets Troy that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) finishes building the fence for Rose, Bono will buy his (<font color='blue'><b>Bono</b></font>) wife, Lucille the refrigerator he (<font color='blue'><b>Bono</b></font>) has promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucille</b></font>) for a long time. Troy tells Rose about a hearing in three weeks to determine whether or not Gabriel should be recommitted to an asylum. Troy tells Rose about his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) affair. Rose accuses Troy of taking and not giving. Troy grabs Rose's arm. Cory grabs Troy from behind. They fight and Troy wins. Troy calls <div class="bookquote">``strike two''  (<font color='red'><b>Cory</b></font>)</div>on Cory. Six months later, Troy says he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) is going over to the hospital to see Alberta who went into labor early. Rose tells Troy that Gabriel has been taken away to the asylum because Troy couldn't read the papers and signed him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) away. Alberta had a baby girl but died during childbirth. Troy challenges Death to come and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) after he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) builds a fence. Troy brings home his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) baby, Raynell. Rose takes in Raynell as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own child, but refuses to be dutiful as Troy's wife. On Troy's payday, Bono shows up unexpectedly. Troy and Bono acknowledge how each man made good on his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) bet about the fence and the refrigerator. Troy insists that Cory leave the house and provide for himself. Cory brings up Troy's recent failings with Rose. Cory points out that the house and property, from which Troy is throwing Cory out, should actually be owned by Gabriel whose government checks paid for most of the mortgage payments. Troy physically attacks Cory. Troy kicks Cory out of the house for good. Cory leaves. Troy swings the baseball bat in the air, taunting Death. Eight years later, Raynell plays in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cory</b></font>) newly planted garden. Troy has died from a heart attack. Cory returns home from the Marines to attend Troy's funeral. Lyons and Bono join Rose too. Cory refuses to attend. Rose teaches Cory that not attending Troy's funeral does not make Cory a man. Raynell and Cory sing one of Troy's father's blues songs. Gabriel turns up, released or escaped from the mental hospital. Gabe blows his (<font color='blue'><b>Cory</b></font>) trumpet but no sound comes out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cory</b></font>) tries again but the trumpet will not play. Disappointed and hurt, Gabriel dances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) makes a cry and the Heavens open wide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``That's the way that goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and the play ends.
