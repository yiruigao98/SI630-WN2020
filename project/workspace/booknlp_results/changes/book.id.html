drives her old car over to the offices of Linga HideAway Travel in order to make
some business travel arrangements. There, she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) meets the head of the company, Ali
Kondey, a charming and handsome man who is later described as the best advertisement
for the company because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) multiple national identities. The two are immediately
attracted to each another. Ali offers to drive Esi home after promising to take care
of all of the necessary travel arrangements, but Esi declines because she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>)
own car. One morning, Ogyaanowa, the daughter of Esi and Oko, listens to the sounds of
her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) parents fighting while she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) eats her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) breakfast. In the bedroom, Oko and Esi
instigate yet another fight about their marriage. Oko is angry that Esi refuses to
have another child and that she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) spends so much time at work. Oko says that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>)
friends are beginning to laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>). Angry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) grabs Esi and forces her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) to have
sex with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>). Rather than apologize for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) actions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) grabs the bed sheet and
walks out of the bedroom. At work, Esi contemplates the fact that what just happened
to her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) could be described as marital rape, even though no such term exists. She (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>)
decides that she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) is going to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) husband. Opokuya, Esi's best friend, begins a conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) husband, Kubi,
about which of them needs the car. Opokuya, in addition to being a nurse, is also a
mother. Although Kubi's needs are frequently less pressing than Opakuya's, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) almost
always <div class="bookquote">``wins''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>their argument and gets use of the car. Esi runs into Opokuya in a
hotel lobby. The two women have a drink and discuss Esi's recent decision to divorce
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband. As they talk, Ali coincidentally enters the hotel as well. Esi tells
Opokuya about the gifts that Ali has been sending her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and Opokuya tells Esi about
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children and marriage. Esi hopes that Opokuya can understand her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) decision to
leave Oko. Ali is already married to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) childhood friend and love, Fusena. The two have
known each other since they were young, and after developing a friendship, they
finally married. Following their marriage, Ali moved to London to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>)
education. Fusena gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) career and education in order to become a mother at
Ali's insistence. In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) marriage to Fusena, Ali and Esi's relationship
grows, and they soon become lovers. Ali disappears for two weeks, in part because of
complications with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) marriage and work. Shortly after he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) sees Esi again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>)
proposes to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). After discussing the potential complications with family and Ali's
wife, Ali offers Esi a wedding band. Following the proposal, Ali begins to spend
more and more time at Esi's house, showering her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) family with gifts. Esi
discusses with Opokuya her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) upcoming marriage and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thoughts on polygamy. Ali takes one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) coworkers to visit Esi's family to discuss the marriage
according to proper tradition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) is rejected because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) fails to bring along a
respectable member of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) family. When Ali finally approaches his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) family and asks
them to speak on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) behalf, they are at first reluctant, but eventually consent.
Esi's mother and grandmother are disappointed in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) decision to get divorced and
become a second wife, but in the end they accept her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) decision. Ali returns to Esi's
family with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) elders, and the marriage is approved. It is a simple ceremony, and
afterward, Esi returns home alone. On New Year's Eve, Ali rushes over to Esi's house before returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>)
family. Shortly after, Oko appears with their daughter, and the two men begin to
fight. Esi grabs Ogyaanowa and runs out of the house to Opokuya's place. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tells
Opokuya and Kubi everything that happened. Kubi goes to Esi's house and finds that
both men have left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) checks on Oko at Oko's mother's house and finds that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) is
only slightly injured. Six months later, Ali takes Esi to Bamako, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) home village, for a vacation.
They have a wonderful time. Ali's family, after initially rejecting Esi, now accepts
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Their relationship begins to change, though after they return, Ali starts
spending less time with Esi. Rather than spending time with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) after work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>)
drives his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) new secretary, who is young and attractive, home. By the end of the year,
Esi feels completely abandoned. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is alienated from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own daughter and spends
Christmas alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) takes sleeping pills to help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) get through the day.
Finally, on New Year's Day, Ali appears at Esi's house, driving
a brand new car. The car is a present and a bribe for Esi. Immediately
after giving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the car, Ali drives off. Esi drives the new car to Opokuya's house.
Opokuya is so jealous and taken aback by the new car that Esi cannot begin to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) really feels about the present. Esi offers Opokuya her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) old car. At the start of another new year, Ali spends more time with Esi but quickly
falls back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) old habits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) sends her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gifts from all over the world in order
to compensate for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) absence. Three years into their marriage, Esi finally tells
Ali that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cannot be in such a relationship with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>). Three months later, Opokuya
finally goes to Esi's house to take away her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) old car. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is too excited about
owning a car to share in Esi's sadness. After Opokuya leaves, Kubi arrives and
searches for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) wife. Upon seeing that Esi is distraught, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) hugs her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and then
begins to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Before Kubi can take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) clothes, Esi backs away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) leaves. Esi and Ali remain close friends and occasional lovers, and they
never get a divorce even though Ali continues to have affairs with other
women.
