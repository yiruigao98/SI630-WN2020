unmarried siblings who live on their ancestral farm, Green Gables,
in the quiet town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Matthew
is sixty, and since he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) is getting too old to handle the farm work on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) own, the Cuthberts decide to adopt an orphan boy to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>).
This decision shocks the town gossip, Mrs. Rachel Lynde, who does
not think Matthew and Marilla fit to raise a child. Matthew, who is terrified of women, arrives at the train
station and finds a girl orphan instead of a boy; the orphanage
sent the eleven-year-old Anne Shirley by mistake. Anne's talkativeness
and spirit charm Matthew, who shyly tells Marilla that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) wants
to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Marilla hesitates at first, but after a trial period,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) agrees to let Anne stay on. Anne is a talkative and happy girl despite living an
impoverished life as an orphan. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lacks social graces and
education, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has a rich and sophisticated fantasy life and an
optimistic and generous spirit. Because Anne acts according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
instincts and not according to a code of manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) unintentionally
defies expectations of proper ladylike behavior. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attends church
for the first time wearing a wreath of wildflowers, for example,
and screams at Mrs. Rachel for making fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) red hair. Anne
tries hard to oblige Marilla and follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rules of social conduct,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) makes many mistakes, using liniment instead of vanilla in
a cake, letting a mouse drown in the plum-pudding sauce, and delivering
a heartfelt but ridiculous prayer on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first attempt to pray before
bed. Anne never had real friends before living at Green Gables,
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was forced to invent imaginary playmates. In Avonlea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
meets Diana Barry, a neighbor who quickly becomes her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bosom friend. One
afternoon Anne invites Diana to tea and accidentally gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) red
currant wine instead of nonalcoholic raspberry cordial. Diana returns
home drunk, and Diana's mother, thinking Anne has intoxicated Diana
on purpose, forbids the girls to speak. The agonizing period of
estrangement lasts until Anne saves Diana's sister, who is sick
with the croup, which causes Mrs. Barry to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). At school, Anne feuds with a handsome, smart boy named
Gilbert Blythe. When they first meet, Gilbert taunts Anne by calling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) Carrots and pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) red braid. Anne is extremely sensitive
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) red hair, and Gilbert's teasing infuriates her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) screams
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) and smashes a slate over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) head. This incident marks the
beginning of a rivalry between Anne and Gilbert, the two smartest
pupils, which lasts until the end of the novel. As Anne grows up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) loses some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) childish flare
for the melodramatic and romantic, and turns her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirited attentions
to academics. A beloved teacher, Miss Stacy, recognizes Anne's intelligence
and encourages her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to join a special group of students preparing
for the entrance exam to Queen's Academy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) long-standing competition
with Gilbert Blythe changes to an affectionate and familiar rivalry
when, after four years of mutual silence, they both go to Queen's
Academy. Striving to make Matthew and Marilla proud, Anne devotes
herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) studies wholeheartedly and earns the prestigious
Avery Scholarship, which grants her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) enough money to attend a four-year
college the following fall. Thrilled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) future prospects, Anne goes home to Green Gables.
Matthew, who has been having heart trouble, dies of a heart attack.
When Anne learns that Marilla is likely to go blind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) decides
to stay at Green Gables and teach nearby so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) can care for
Marilla, giving up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) aspirations for a four-year degree. Gilbert hears
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) decision and gives up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) post as the teacher at Avonlea school
so that Anne can teach there and be closer to Marilla. After five
years of rivalry, Gilbert and Anne forge a close friendship. Though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) future path has narrowed considerably, Anne remains eternally
optimistic and thinks cheerfully about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) future.
