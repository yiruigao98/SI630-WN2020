(<font color='red'><b>Swift</b></font>)</div>The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to <div class="bookquote">``find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>for converting the starving children of Ireland into <div class="bookquote">``sound and useful members of the Commonwealth.''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed. The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation. The author offers statistical support for his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed.
