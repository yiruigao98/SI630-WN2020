man named Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange
in the isolated moor country of England. Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) meets his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) dour landlord,
Heathcliff, a wealthy man who lives in the ancient manor of Wuthering
Heights, four miles away from the Grange. In this wild, stormy countryside,
Lockwood asks his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) housekeeper, Nelly Dean, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) the story
of Heathcliff and the strange denizens of Wuthering Heights. Nelly
consents, and Lockwood writes down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) recollections of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) tale
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) diary; these written recollections form the main part of Wuthering
Heights. Nelly remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) childhood. As a young girl,
she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) works as a servant at Wuthering Heights for the owner of the
manor, Mr. Earnshaw, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) family. One day, Mr. Earnshaw goes
to Liverpool and returns home with an orphan boy whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) will raise
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) own children. At first, the Earnshaw children--a boy named
Hindley and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) younger sister Catherine--detest the dark-skinned
Heathcliff. But Catherine quickly comes to love him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and the two
soon grow inseparable, spending their days playing on the moors.
After his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wife's death, Mr. Earnshaw grows to prefer Heathcliff
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) own son, and when Hindley continues his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) cruelty to Heathcliff,
Mr. Earnshaw sends Hindley away to college, keeping Heathcliff nearby. Three years later, Mr. Earnshaw dies, and Hindley inherits
Wuthering Heights. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) returns with a wife, Frances, and immediately seeks
revenge on Heathcliff. Once an orphan, later a pampered and favored
son, Heathcliff now finds himself treated as a common laborer,
forced to work in the fields. Heathcliff continues his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) close relationship
with Catherine, however. One night they wander to Thrushcross Grange,
hoping to tease Edgar and Isabella Linton, the cowardly, snobbish
children who live there. Catherine is bitten by a dog and is forced
to stay at the Grange to recuperate for five weeks, during which time
Mrs. Linton works to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) a proper young lady. By the time Catherine
returns, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has become infatuated with Edgar, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) relationship
with Heathcliff grows more complicated. When Frances dies after giving birth to a baby
boy named Hareton, Hindley descends into the depths of alcoholism,
and behaves even more cruelly and abusively toward Heathcliff. Eventually,
Catherine's desire for social advancement prompts her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to become
engaged to Edgar Linton, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) overpowering love for Heathcliff.
Heathcliff runs away from Wuthering Heights, staying away for three
years, and returning shortly after Catherine and Edgar's marriage. When Heathcliff returns, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) immediately sets about seeking revenge
on all who have wronged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). Having come into a vast and mysterious
wealth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) deviously lends money to the drunken Hindley, knowing
that Hindley will increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) debts and fall into deeper despondency.
When Hindley dies, Heathcliff inherits the manor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) also
places himself in line to inherit Thrushcross Grange by marrying Isabella
Linton, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) treats very cruelly. Catherine becomes ill, gives
birth to a daughter, and dies. Heathcliff begs her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirit to remain on
Earth--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) may take whatever form she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) may haunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), drive
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) mad--just as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) does not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) alone. Shortly thereafter,
Isabella flees to London and gives birth to Heathcliff's son, named
Linton after her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) keeps the boy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) there. Thirteen years pass, during which Nelly Dean serves as
Catherine's daughter's nursemaid at Thrushcross Grange. Young Catherine
is beautiful and headstrong like her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) temperament
is modified by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's gentler influence. Young Catherine grows
up at the Grange with no knowledge of Wuthering Heights; one day,
however, wandering through the moors, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) discovers the manor, meets
Hareton, and plays together with him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>). Soon afterwards, Isabella
dies, and Linton comes to live with Heathcliff. Heathcliff treats
his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) sickly, whining son even more cruelly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) treated the boy's
mother. Three years later, Catherine meets Heathcliff
on the moors, and makes a visit to Wuthering Heights to meet Linton.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and Linton begin a secret romance conducted entirely through
letters. When Nelly destroys Catherine's collection of letters,
the girl begins sneaking out at night to spend time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) frail young
lover, who asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to come back and nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) back to health. However,
it quickly becomes apparent that Linton is pursuing Catherine only
because Heathcliff is forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to; Heathcliff hopes that if Catherine
marries Linton, his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) legal claim upon Thrushcross Grange--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
revenge upon Edgar Linton--will be complete. One day, as Edgar Linton
grows ill and nears death, Heathcliff lures Nelly and Catherine
back to Wuthering Heights, and holds them prisoner until Catherine
marries Linton. Soon after the marriage, Edgar dies, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) death
is quickly followed by the death of the sickly Linton. Heathcliff
now controls both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) forces
Catherine to live at Wuthering Heights and act as a common servant, while
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) rents Thrushcross Grange to Lockwood. Nelly's story ends as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reaches the present. Lockwood, appalled,
ends his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) tenancy at Thrushcross Grange and returns to London. However,
six months later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) pays a visit to Nelly, and learns of further
developments in the story. Although Catherine originally mocked
Hareton's ignorance and illiteracy -LRB-in an act of retribution, Heathcliff
ended Hareton's education after Hindley died-RRB-, Catherine grows to
love Hareton as they live together at Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff
becomes more and more obsessed with the memory of the elder Catherine,
to the extent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) begins speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ghost. Everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)
sees reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Shortly after a night spent walking on
the moors, Heathcliff dies. Hareton and young Catherine inherit
Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, and they plan to be married
on the next New Year's Day. After hearing the end of the story,
Lockwood goes to visit the graves of Catherine and Heathcliff. The story of Wuthering Heights is told
through flashbacks recorded in diary entries, and events are often
presented out of chronological order--Lockwood's narrative takes
place after Nelly's narrative, for instance, but is interspersed
with Nelly's story in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) journal. Nevertheless, the novel contains
enough clues to enable an approximate reconstruction of its chronology,
which was elaborately designed by Emily BrontÃ«. For instance, Lockwood's
diary entries are recorded in the late months of 1801 and
in September 1802;
in 1801, Nelly tells
Lockwood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) has lived at Thrushcross Grange for eighteen years,
since Catherine's marriage to Edgar, which must then have occurred
in 1783. We know that
Catherine was engaged to Edgar for three years, and that Nelly was
twenty-two when they were engaged, so the engagement must have taken
place in 1780, and
Nelly must have been born in 1758.
Since Nelly is a few years older than Catherine, and since Lockwood
comments that Heathcliff is about forty years old in 1801,
it stands to reason that Heathcliff and Catherine were born around 1761,
three years after Nelly. There are several other clues like this
in the novel -LRB-such as Hareton's birth, which occurs in June, 1778-RRB-.
The following chronology is based on those clues, and should closely
approximate the timing of the novel's important events. A <div class="bookquote">``~''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>before
a date indicates that it cannot be precisely determined from the
evidence in the novel, but only closely estimated.
