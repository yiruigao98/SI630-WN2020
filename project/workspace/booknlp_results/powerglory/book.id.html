He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is on the run from the police because religion has been outlawed in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) state and he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is the last remaining clergyman. While talking to a man named Mr. Tench, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tench</b></font>) is summoned to a dying woman's house and misses his (<font color='blue'><b>Tench</b></font>) boat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tench</b></font>) hides out in a barn on the estate of a plantation owner, befriending the owner's daughter. Forced to move on, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) heads to a village in which he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) used to live and work as pastor. There he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) meets Maria, a woman with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) has had a brief affair, and Brigida, his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) illegitimate daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) spends the night in the town and wakes before dawn to say mass for the villagers. The lieutenant--a sworn enemy of all r eligion--arrives at the end of mass, leading a group of policemen in search of the priest, and the priest goes out to the town square to face his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) enemy. No one in the village turns him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) in, however, and the lieutenant does not realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) has foun d the man he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) is looking for. Instead, the lieutenant takes a hostage, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) will execute if he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) finds that the villagers have been lying to him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) about the whereabouts of the wanted man. The priest heads to the town of Carmen, and on the way he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) meets a man known simply as the mestizo. Uninvited, the mestizo accompanies the priest on his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) journey, and it very soon becomes clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is an untrustworthy figure, and most likely interes ted in following the priest so that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) can turn him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) in and collect the reward money. The priest finally admits that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is, indeed, a priest. But the mestizo, who has become feverish by the second day of their journey together, does not have the strength t o follow the priest when he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) veers off course. The priest knows that if he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) enters Carmen he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) will surely be captured, and he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) lets the mestizo ride on towards the town by himself. The priest then backtracks to the capital city. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is in disguise, wearing a drill suit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) tries to procure a bottle of wine so he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) can say mass. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) meets a beggar who takes him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) to a hotel and introduces him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) to a man who says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can supply him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with th e wine. The man arrives and sells the priest a bottle of wine and a bottle of brandy. But, taking advantage of the priest's offer to share a drink with him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), the man proceeds to drink the entire bottle of wine, thwarting the priest's plan. The priest then leaves the hotel but is caught with the bottle of brandy by a state official. After a lengthy chase through the streets of the town, during which the priest unsuccessfully attempts to take refuge at the house of Padre Jose, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is caught and taken to j ail. In jail he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) speaks with the prisoners, admitting to them that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is a priest. A pious woman, in jail for having religious articles in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) home, argues with the priest. The next day, the priest is ordered to clean out the cells and, while doing so, meets the mestizo again. But the mestizo decides not to turn the priest in to the authorities. The priest has another face-to-face encounter with the lieutenant, but again goes unrecognized, and is allowed to go free. The priest spends a night at the abandoned estate of the Fellows and then moves on to an abandoned village. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) meets an Indian woman whose son has been shot and killed by the gringo, an American outlaw who is also on the run from police. He (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) accompanie s the woman to a burial ground and then leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) there. Fatigued, and almost completely drained of the will to live, the priest staggers on, eventually coming upon a man named Mr. Lehr who informs him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is out of danger, having crossed the bor der into a neighboring state where religion is not outlawed. After spending a few days at the home of Mr. Lehr, the priest prepares to leave for Las Casas. But before he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) can depart, the mestizo arrives, informing him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) that the gringo has been mortally wounded by the police and is asking for someone to come and hear his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) confession. The priest, aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is walking into a trap, finally agrees to accompany the mestizo back across the border. There he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) meets the gringo, who refuses to repent for his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) sins and then dies. Then, as expected, the lieutenant arrives and ta kes the priest into custody. The two men have a long conversation about their beliefs and then, when the storm front clears, the lieutenant takes the priest back to the capital city for his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) trial. On the night before the priest is to be executed, the lieutenant goes to the home of Padre Jose to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) will come and hear the confession of the captured priest. Padre Jose refuses and the lieutenant returns to the police station with a bottle of bra ndy for the priest. That night, the priest tries to repent for his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) sins, but finds he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) cannot. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) wakes up the next morning afraid of the impending execution. The next day, Mr. Tench watches the execution from the window of the jefe's office. Later that night the boy hears about what happened to the priest and realizes that the man is a martyr and a hero. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) dreams about him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) that night, and wakes up to the sound of knocking at the door. Opening the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) finds a man seeking shelter, and when the boy learns that the man is a priest, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) swings the door wide open to let him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) in.
