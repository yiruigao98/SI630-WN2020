In section I, Peyton Farquhar is standing on a railroad bridge, twenty feet above the water. His (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) wrists are bound behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) back, and around his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) neck is a noose that is tied to a beam overhead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) is positioned on loose planks that have been laid over the crossties of the train tracks to create a makeshift platform. Two soldiers from the Northern army, a sergeant, and a captain immediately surround him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), awaiting the execution. Beyond them, armed sentinels stand at attention. The bridge is bordered on one side by forest and, across the stream, open ground that gives way to a small hillock on which a small fort has been erected. A motionless company of infantrymen, led by their lieutenant, stands assembled before the fort. As the two soldiers finalize the preparations, they step back and remove the individual planks on which they had been standing. The sergeant salutes the captain then positions himself on the opposite end of the board supporting Farquhar, as the captain, like the soldiers, steps off and away from the crossties. Awaiting the captain's signal, the sergeant is about to likewise step away, sending Farquhar to dangle from the bridge's edge. Farquhar stares into the swirling water below. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) watches a piece of driftwood being carried downstream and notes how sluggish the stream seems to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) shuts his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) eyes to push away the distractions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) present situation and focus more intently on thoughts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) wife and children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) suddenly hears a sharp, metallic ringing, which sounds both distant and close by. The sound turns out to be the ticking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) watch. Opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) eyes and peering again into the water, Farquhar imagines freeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) hands, removing the noose, and plunging into the stream, swimming to freedom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) home, safely located outside enemy lines. These thoughts have barely registered in Farquhar's mind when the captain nods to the sergeant and the sergeant steps away from the board. In section II, we learn that Farquhar was a successful planter, ardently devoted to the Southern cause. Unable to join the Confederate army, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) yearned to help the South's war effort in some significant way. One evening in the past, Farquhar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) wife were sitting on the edge of their property when a gray-clad soldier rode up, seeking a drink of water. The soldier appeared to be from the Confederate army. While his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) wife was fetching the water, Farquhar asked for news of the front and was informed that Northern forces had repaired the railroads in anticipation of launching another advance, having already reached the Owl Creek bridge. Any civilian caught interfering with the North's efforts in the area, the soldier went on to reveal, would be hanged. Farquhar asked how a civilian could attempt some form of sabotage. The soldier told him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) that one could easily set fire to the driftwood that had piled up near the bridge after the past winter's flood. The man, who was actually a Northern scout in disguise, finished his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) drink and rode off, only to pass by an hour later heading in the opposite direction. Section III brings us back to the present, at the hanging. Farquhar loses consciousness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) plummets down from the side of the bridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) is awakened by currents of pain running through his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) body. A loud splash wakes him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) up even more abruptly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) realizes that the noose has broken--sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) falling into the stream below. Farquhar sees a light flicker and fade before it strengthens and brightens as he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) rises, with some trepidation, to the surface. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) is afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) will be shot by Northern soldiers as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) is spotted in the water. Freeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) bound hands, then lifting the noose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) neck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) fights extreme pain to break through the surface and take a large gasp of air, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) exhales with a shriek. Farquhar looks back to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) executioners standing on the bridge, in silhouette against the sky. One of the sentinels fires his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) rifle at him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) twice. Farquhar can see the gray eye of the marksman through the gun's sights. Farquhar then hears the lieutenant instructing his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) men to fire, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) dives down to avoid the shots. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) quickly removes a piece of metal that sticks in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) neck. Farquhar comes back up for air as the soldiers reload, and the sentinels fire again from the bridge. Swimming with the current, Farquhar realizes that a barrage of gunfire is about to come his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) way. A cannonball lands two yards away, sending a sheet of spray crashing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>). The deflected shot goes smashing into the trees beyond. Farquhar believes they will next fire a spray of grapeshot from the cannon, instead of a single ball, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) will have to anticipate the firing. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) is spun into a disorienting whirl, then ejected from the river onto a gravelly bank out of sight and range of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) would-be executioners and their gunfire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) weeps with joy and marvels at the landscape, having no desire to put any more distance between him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) pursuers, when a volley of grapeshot overhead rouses him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) heads into the forest, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) path by the sun and traveling the entire day. The thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) family urges him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) on. Taking a remote road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) finds himself in the early morning standing at the gate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) home. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) walks toward the house, his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) wife steps down from the verandah to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) moves to embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) but feels a sharp blow on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) neck and sees a blinding white light all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>). Then silence and darkness engulf him (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>). Farquhar is dead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Farquhar</b></font>) broken body actually swinging from the side of the Owl Creek bridge.
