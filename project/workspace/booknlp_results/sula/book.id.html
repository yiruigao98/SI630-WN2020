The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) former slave. This <div class="bookquote">``gift''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course. Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) life. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) methods involves compartmentalizing his (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) fear of death in a ritual he (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>). Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) mother, Helene, wants for her (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>); these doubts are hammered home when she (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) meets Rochelle, her (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) family line. Sula's family is very different: she (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) lives with her (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) grandmother, Eva, and her (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders. Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands. When she (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) loses her (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dies of the burns. After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has many affairs, some with white men. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) returns to the Bottom and to Nel. Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves. In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had blamed his (<font color='blue'><b>Nel</b></font>) death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the <div class="bookquote">``good''  (<font color='red'><b>Sula</b></font>)</div>half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as <div class="bookquote">``good.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness. Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms <div class="bookquote">``good''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``evil,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of <div class="bookquote">``good and evil,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``right and wrong''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors.
