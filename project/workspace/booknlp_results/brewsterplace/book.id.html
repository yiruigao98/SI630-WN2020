Of
the seven stories, six are centered on individual characters, while the final story
is about the entire community. The primary characters and the title characters of
each chapter are all women and residents of Brewster Place. Brewster Place is a housing development in an unnamed city. It seems destined
to be an unfortunate place since the people linked to its creation are all corrupt.
Despite the secretive circumstances surrounding its development, Brewster Place
survives for decades, offering a home to one new wave of migrants after another. The
life history of Brewster Place comes to resemble the history of the country as the
community changes with each new historical shift. Following the Civil Rights Era,
Brewster Place inherits its last inhabitants, African-Americans, many of whom are
migrants from the southern half of the United States. The stories within the novel
are the stories of these residents. The first and longest narrative within the novel is Mattie Michael's. Mattie,
along with several other characters, arrives in Brewster Place from her (<font color='blue'><b>migrants</b></font>) parents'
home in the South. Mattie leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>migrants</b></font>) parents' home because she (<font color='blue'><b>migrants</b></font>) is pregnant by a
disreputable man named Butch Fuller. Mattie decides to move to the North at
approximately the same time in history as the Great Migration. Living away from home
with a new baby, Mattie takes a job working in an assembly line. She (<font color='blue'><b>migrants</b></font>) works long
hours and is forced to live in a dilapidated building. After a rat bites her (<font color='blue'><b>migrants</b></font>) child,
Mattie decides to find a new home. While walking with her (<font color='blue'><b>migrants</b></font>) baby, she (<font color='blue'><b>migrants</b></font>) runs into Ms.
Eva Turner, an old, kind, light-skinned African-American woman who takes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) home and refuses to charge her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rent. After Ms. Eva dies, Mattie purchases the
house and remains there to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) son, Basil. Basil grows up to be a troubled young man who is unable to claim
responsibility for his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) actions. One night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) kills a man in a bar fight
and is arrested. Mattie uses her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) house for collateral, which Basil
forfeits once he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) disappears. Mattie, after thirty years, is forced to give
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) home and move to Brewster Place. Mattie's childhood friend, Etta Johnson, joins Mattie at Brewster Place. After
a long life of running from one man to the next, she (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>) has arrived at Mattie's, hoping
to find some stability. Mattie takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>) to church, where Etta meets Reverend Woods.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>) is taken by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) looks, wealth, and status, but after sleeping with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>)
realizes it was all just a fantasy and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wanted only sex. Etta leaves feeling
broken, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>) spirit is restored once she (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>) finds out that Mattie has stayed up all
night waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>). Kiswana Browne is different from all of Brewster Place's other residents in
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>) has chosen to live there voluntarily. Raised in the affluent community,
Linden Hills, Kiswana dropped out of college to live in Brewster Place, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>)
believes she (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>) can effect real social change in the black community. Kiswana is
nervously waiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>) mother's first visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>) rundown studio apartment. Once her (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>)
mother arrives, the two women have several short arguments that culminate in Kiswana
calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Etta</b></font>) mother a <div class="bookquote">``white-man's nigger.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Kiswana's mother responds by explaining
the origin of Kiswana's real name, Melanie, and the pride she (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>) has in her (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>) heritage.
Before leaving, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>) secretly gives Kiswana enough money to have a phone line
installed. Lucielia Louis Turner, also known as Ciel, is the granddaughter of Ms. Eva.
Lucielia grew up with Mattie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) son, Basil. Now grown, Lucielia has a daughter,
Serena, with a man named Eugene. Eugene, in addition to constantly leaving
Lucielia, also treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) and their daughter terribly. After complaining about his (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>)
lack of opportunities, Eugene indirectly gets Lucielia to abort what would have been
their second child. Shortly afterward, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>) comes home to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>)'s found
a new job in Maine and must leave right away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>) lying is obvious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>)'s simply
determined to leave. While Lucielia and Eugene are fighting, Serena chases a roach
into an electric socket with a fork. She (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) is electrocuted and dies, leaving Lucielia
nearly lifeless with grief. Following the funeral, Mattie is the one who begins to
release Lucielia's enormous grief by rocking and bathing her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) until she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) falls asleep
crying. As a child, Cora Lee was obsessed with babies, and this obsession continues
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) is an adult. Beginning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) sophomore year of high school, she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) has one
child after another, almost all with different men. She (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) lives in a filthy apartment,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) children are terribly neglected, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) can only care for them while
they're infants. One day, Kiswana finds one of Cora Lee's children eating out of a
garbage can. She (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) tries to help Cora Lee by inviting her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) to a production of a
Shakespeare play being staged in the park. Cora Lee is so moved by Kiswana's brief
appearance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) takes interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) cleans them and the house in
preparation for the play. At the play, the children and Cora Lee are all touched by
the performance. By the end, Cora Lee begins to imagine a better future for her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>)
children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) kisses them all goodnight. However, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) goes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) own bed,
there's a nameless man waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) drops her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) clothes and goes to bed with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Lorraine and Theresa are the only lesbian residents of Brewster Place. The
residents fear Lorraine and Theresa, even though they are a loving and considerate
couple. One resident in particular, Sophie, watches their every move and spreads
rumors about their behavior. Lorraine is hurt by the judgmental responses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>)
neighbors. Theresa, however, claims not to care what people think or say. Lorraine
tries to incorporate herself into the community by attending Kiswana's tenants'
association meeting, but there, Sophie attacks her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) sexuality. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) leaves in
tears, and Ben, the oldest resident and the janitor of the complex, consoles her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) by
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) apartment and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) daughter and wife.
Ben's daughter was indirectly led into prostitution by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) parents, who refused to
do anything about the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was being forced to sleep with their white
landlord. Lorraine gains confidence from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) burgeoning relationship with Ben. After a
fight with Theresa, Lorraine goes to a party on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) own. Afterward, instead of
coming straight home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) goes down a dark alley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) is confronted by a group of
young men who had earlier insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) sexuality. They gang rape her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>)
and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) for dead. Lorraine manages to get up just as the sun is rising. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>)
stumbles down the alley and sees Ben. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorraine</b></font>) grabs a brick and crushes his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) skull with
it. Following Ben's death, Mattie has a dream that the rain that has drenched
Brewster Place since Ben's murder has suddenly stopped in time for the block party
planned by the tenants' association. The rain eventually returns during the party,
and everyone except the women run for shelter. The women believe that the wall in
front of which Ben died still has blood on it, so they begin to frantically tear it
apart, brick by brick. Mattie wakes to a beautiful sunny day. In the end, all of the
residents of Brewster Place are forced out, and the block is condemned. Brewster
Place, abandoned, lives on only in the hopes and memories of the women who once
lived there.
