As a young boy, Tom lives with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother Bessie and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father George Black Bull in Pagosa. However, when George Black Bull kills Frank No Deer for having repeatedly stolen money from him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), the family must flee the town. Returning to the wilderness, they live happily in the old Ute way. One winter day, an avalanche kills Tom's father as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hunts in a valley. Tom adopts the name <div class="bookquote">``Bear's Brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>as well as the role of the man of the family. When Bessie returns to Pagosa to visit the general store, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) learns that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) husband's name has been cleared but still hesitates to move back into town. The following winter, Bessie becomes ill and dies. Living alone in the wilderness, Tom befriends many animals and becomes particularly close to a bear cub whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) considers his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) closest friend and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brother. When another Ute, Blue Elk, approaches Tom, allegedly to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to spread knowledge of the old Ute ways to the townspeople of Pagosa, Tom agrees to travel there. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bear accompanies him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) journey. However, Blue Elk forces Tom to attend the local reservation school, where Tom becomes angry and depressed, and where the teachers chain the bear to a fence. Blue Elk soon tricks Tom into believing he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) will be released, but they journey into the mountains solely to release the bear. After numerous unappealing classes and jobs, Tom meets a man named Red Dillon during a trip to the town of Bayfield. Red, impressed with Tom's ability to ride a wild bronco, convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ranch with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to better his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) riding skills. After some training at Red's ranch, Tom and Red travel to countless rodeo competitions, at which Tom demonstrates his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) skill. But, Tom must obey Red's instructions to ride in a way that will benefit Red's betting efforts. Over the years, Tom becomes increasingly frustrated with Red's control over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), as well as Red's drunken and obnoxious behavior, and soon Tom asserts his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) independence from Red. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) competition has finished, Tom drives Red back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ranch. In the fall Red wants to take a trip with Tom, but Tom refuses to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); nonetheless, Red soon departs. A stranger comes to Red's ranch to inform his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Mexican cook, Meo, and Tom that Red has become very ill. Rushing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aid, Tom travels to the hotel where Red is staying in order to care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). However, Tom cannot even carry Red to the car before Red dies in Tom's arms. Returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rodeo life, Tom enters the professional circuit, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) continues to exhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) skill and brutality, developing a reputation as <div class="bookquote">``Killer Tom Black.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When Tom returns to Red's old ranch to visit Meo, Meo shows little interest in conversation and seems to act oddly; Tom leaves promising to return shortly. During a particularly brutal ride Tom breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm, and leaves the hospital to visit Meo once again. Arriving at the cabin, Tom finds Meo absent and later learns from a doctor in town that Meo has died a few weeks prior. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) falls into an even deeper despair, having lost many people in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) riding style becomes increasingly abusive, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) social behavior increasingly reclusive. During a ride at the Garden in New York City, Tom becomes seriously injured in a fall. Nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) injuries at the hospital, Tom receives advice from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) doctor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should never ride again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) remains determined to return to the ring. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nurse Mary Redmond treats him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with care and kindness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) resents her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) efforts and believes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) simply wants to control his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life, as so many other individuals have tried before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Having regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ability to walk after significant efforts, Tom leaves the hospital with only a curt goodbye from Mary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heads west on a train to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) homeland. In Pagosa, Tom feels self-conscious and assaulted by many memories of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) younger life there. In the general store, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) meets Jim Woodward, who offers him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a job as a shepherd in the mountains. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) decides to work as a shepherd for a while. During his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) time in the mountains, Tom has the necessary time and space for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thoughts. Contemplating his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) past and the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life, Tom first begins to recognize his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) poor treatment of both animals and other people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) also begins to process his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) painful memories and to come to terms with them. One day a bear emerges from the woods and kills one of the sheep; Tom reacts by yelling at it to run away. Later he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) regrets not having killed the bear and regards his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hesitation to shoot it as foolish. Returning to town with Jim, Tom gathers supplies at the hardware store before packing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bag and heading back up to Horse Mountain unobserved. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) intends to kill the bear that has killed the lamb. However, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) finally spots the bear once again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aims his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rifle at it but finds he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cannot pull the trigger. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dreams the All-Mother appears and defends him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from the fury of nature's element, claiming Tom as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) son. Tom leaves the bear alone and engages in the old Ute ways. The novel ends with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) contentment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) solitary life in the wilderness and in the ways of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heritage.
