In response to their protests, the ruling aristocracy, or patricians, grant the plebeians five representatives, or tribunes--a decision that provokes the ire of the proud patrician soldier Caius Martius, who has nothing but contempt for the lower classes. At this time, war breaks out with a neighboring Italian tribe, the Volscians, who are led by Martius' great rival, Tullus Aufidius. In the campaign that follows, the Volscians are defeated, and the Rome takes the Italian city of Corioles, thanks to the heroism of Martius. In recognition of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) great deeds, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) is granted the name Coriolanus. Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) return to Rome, Coriolanus is given a hero's welcome, and the Senate offers to make him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) consul. In order to gain this office, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) must go out and plead for the votes of the plebeians, a task that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) undertakes reluctantly. At first, the common people agree to give him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) their votes, but they later reverse their decision at the prodding of two clever tribunes, Brutus and Sicinius, who consider Coriolanus an enemy of the people. This drives the proud Coriolanus into a fury, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) speaks out intemperately against the very idea of popular rule; Brutus and Sicinius, seizing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) words, declare him (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) a traitor to the Roman state and drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) into exile. Desiring revenge against Rome, Coriolanus goes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) Volscian enemy, Aufidius, in the city of Antium, and makes peace with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>). Aufidius is planning a new campaign against the Romans, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) welcomes Coriolanus's assistance, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) soon feels himself to be falling into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) new ally's shadow. Their army proceeds to march on Rome, throwing the city into a panic--Rome's armies are helpless to stop the advance, and soon Aufidius and Coriolanus are encamped outside the city walls. Two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) oldest friends come pleading for mercy, but Coriolanus refuses to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>). However, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) mother, Volumnia, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) is devoted, begs him (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) to make peace, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) relents, and the Romans hail Volumnia the savior of the city. Meanwhile, Coriolanus and the Volscians return to Antium, where the residents hail Coriolanus as a hero. Aufidius, feeling slighted, declares that Coriolanus's failure to take Rome amounts to treachery; in the ensuing argument, some of Aufidius' men assassinate Coriolanus.
