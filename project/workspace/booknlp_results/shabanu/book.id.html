They own a herd of fine camels, and as long as there is water in the nearby pond -LRB-called a <div class="bookquote">``toba'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, they live a proud and free existence in the windswept desert of Pakistan. Once a year, they attend a fair in Sibi, which lies across the desert and where they sell their camels in order to buy goods they need. When the toba dries up, they move to nearby villages with deep wells. When this happens, they wait eagerly for rain to fill the toba, which will allow them to move back to their beloved desert home. Shabanu regards her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) older sister, Phulan, with disdain and envy. Phulan is beautiful and graceful. Her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) parents have promised her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) to a young man, Hamir, in a nearby farming village. The wedding will take place in the summer, when the monsoon rains come. Shabanu has been promised to this young man's brother, Murad, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) is younger, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wedding is still far off. Shabanu loves her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) life in the desert. Her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) parents are gentle and indulgent. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) adores the camels of their herd. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) is especially proud of Guluband, a great and intelligent beast, who dances when he (<font color='blue'><b>Murad</b></font>) hears music. Shabanu and her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) father travel across the desert lands to the fair at Sibi. Their sales at Sibi this year are especially important, as they will help pay for Phulan's dowry. At Sibi, Guluband is by far the best camel. Many people want to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>Murad</b></font>), but Dadi refuses to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dadi</b></font>). An Afghani soldier, who will subject the poor camel to the conditions of war, shows special interest in Guluband. Dadi names an exorbitant price, and the man storms off. Dadi sells the rest of the herd quite successfully. However, the next day, the soldier returns with all the money for which Dadi had asked. Dadi must sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dadi</b></font>) the camel. Shabanu feels betrayed and crushed. Dadi and Shabanu return home. The family prepares for the wedding by buying and sewing beautiful clothes and making a pilgrimage to Channan Pir. Women pray for sons and good marriages at this holy shrine. At Channan Pir, the women of the family meet Mama's bold cousin, Sharma, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) daughter, Fatima. Sharma left her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) abusive husband for a simple but independent existence in the desert, raising goats and sheep. Shabanu looks up to Sharma and often wishes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) could steal away to live a wild and free life in the desert with Sharma and Fatima. Sharma loves Shabanu, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) insists that Shabanu is lucky to be betrothed to such a gentle and upstanding young man. When they return from Channan Pir, a dust storm whirls up. Grandfather, who is old and often unaware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) surroundings, wanders off into the storm before anyone notices. When they find him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) the next morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) is near death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) begs them to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) to Derawar, a fort where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) will receive a burial befitting a soldier. The family travels to Derawar, but eventually must bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) in a humble grave at the edges of town. As the dust storm has filled the toba, the family sets out for Mehrabpur, where Hamir's family lives. Hamir's family bought their patch of land from a greedy landowner named Nazir Mohammad. The family labored over the land and it became rich and fertile. Nazir Mohammad is trying to force the family to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mohammad</b></font>) part of their crops, claiming they did not actually buy the land from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mohammad</b></font>). One evening, Shabanu and Phulan are fetching water when they come across Nazir Mohammad and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mohammad</b></font>) friends. They see the girls and plan to take Phulan and rape her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamir</b></font>). Shabanu throws the water pots at the men, sweeps Phulan up onto a camel, and rides home. Dadi sends the women off toward Derawar, fearful of Nazir Mohammad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dadi</b></font>) runs to tell Hamir what has happened. Hamir becomes violently angry, and when Nazir Mohammad appears shortly thereafter, Hamir attempts to shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamir</b></font>). Nazir Mohammad kills Hamir. The Desert Rangers find the women and take them to a nearby post, where the families will gather to settle the dispute. Nazir Mohammad's brother, Rahim- sahib, is a politician and wants to settle the dispute quickly. At the ranger post, Hamir's family, Shabanu's family, and Rahim- sahib talk far into the night. The next day, they announce the settlement: Phulan will marry Murad right away, Nazir Mohammad will leave the family alone, and Rahim-sahib, who met Shabanu briefly in the courtyard, will take Shabanu as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mohammad</b></font>) fourth wife. Shabanu is devastated. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) numbly endures Phulan's wedding. Sharma, however, draws her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aside. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) counsels Shabanu to learn to manipulate and control the doting man, to remain true to herself, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart hidden from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and, if all else fails, to escape and join her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Fatima in the desert. After the wedding, the family returns to their home in the desert. Shabanu tries to reconcile herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) future. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) period starts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) hides it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) parents, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) must marry soon after. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) father finds out she (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) has hidden something from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is livid: her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) secretive and rebellious behavior does not befit a woman. Shabanu quickly decides to leave for Sharma's that very night. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) parents are asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) slips out and climbs atop a camel. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) favorite young camels insists on following her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) rides all night and is almost assured of freedom, when the young camel falls and breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>Sharma</b></font>) leg. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) knows that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) leaves the camel, predators will attack and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Sharma</b></font>). Rather than leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sharma</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) waits, knowing Dadi will find them in a few hours. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dadi</b></font>) does, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dadi</b></font>) beats her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) violently. Shabanu stands silently under his (<font color='blue'><b>Dadi</b></font>) attack. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) resigns herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) fate, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) carefully guards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) inner happiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fatima</b></font>) heart.
