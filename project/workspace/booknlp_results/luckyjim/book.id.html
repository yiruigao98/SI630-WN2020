Dixon has not made a good impression upon the faculty and knows that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) superior, the absent-minded Professor Welch, could ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Welch</b></font>) to leave at the end of term next month. Fearful of making further bad impressions or revealing his (<font color='blue'><b>Welch</b></font>) inner disgust for Welch, Dixon agrees to give the end-of-term lecture on the theme of <div class="bookquote">``Merrie England''  (<font color='red'><b>Dixon</b></font>)</div>and to stay with the Welches the following weekend for a weekend of music and the arts. At the party, Dixon meets Welch's son Bertrand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) girlfriend Christine, who have come up to the country from London. Bertrand, an artist, seems pretentious, while Christine seems uptight and unattainable. Dixon escapes to the pub and returns to the Welches' later that night, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) makes a drunken pass at Margaret Peel, a friend and colleague. Margaret has been staying with the Welches as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) recovers from a recent suicide attempt caused by a recent break-up. Dixon and Margaret's friendship has rapidly been moving toward something more intimate, thanks to Margaret's subtle pressure and Dixon's pity and good-natured concern for Margaret. Margaret kicks Dixon out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) falls asleep while smoking a cigarette. Dixon wakes up in the morning to find he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) has burned holes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) bedsheets. Afraid of further damaging his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) chances of keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) job, Dixon attempts to hide the damage. Christine unexpectedly find Dixon's dilemma funny and agrees to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>). Dixon thinks about Christine but does not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) again until the college's Summer Ball a couple of weeks later. Margaret and Bertrand both spend the night hanging around Christine's rich uncle Gore-Urquhart, who Bertrand hopes to work for. Dixon's friend Carol Goldsmith finally convinces Dixon to make a move for Christine by revealing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) has been having an affair with Bertrand. Dixon rallies his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) courage and asks Christine, whom Bertrand has been ignoring, to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) home early. Christine agrees and explains to Dixon in the taxi how Bertrand has been mistreating her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>). Back at the Welches', Christine and Dixon kiss and agree to see each other in two days. When they meet again, however, they decide not to see anymore of each other because of their respective obligations to both Bertrand and Margaret. Dixon spends the following week planning to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Merrie England''  (<font color='red'><b>Dixon</b></font>)</div>lecture in a nostalgic way that will appeal to Professor Welch, but Welch himself keeps Dixon preoccupied with menial fact-checking for Welch's own work. On the day of Dixon's lecture, Bertrand comes to Dixon's room and accuses Dixon of seeing Christine behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) back. Bertrand tells Dixon that Dixon is wasting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) time and Dixon, fed up with Bertrand's hypocrisy and condescending bossiness, gets in a fight with Bertrand. Bertrand gives Dixon a black eye and Dixon knocks him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) down. Shaken up and nervous, Dixon drinks quite a lot at the reception before his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) lecture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is drunk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) gives the lecture, and inadvertently imitates the voices of Professor Welch and the college Principal in the opening segments. Dixon rounds out the lecture by expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) contempt for the subject before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) passes out. The next day, Dixon finds he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) has been fired, but is offered a well-paying job in London by Gore-Urquhart. The same day, Dixon meets with Catchpole, the man who supposedly inspired Margaret's suicide attempt. Catchpole reveals that Margaret faked the suicide attempt in order to gain sympathy from Dixon and Catchpole. Dixon arrives home from this meeting to receive a message from Christine, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) at the train station before her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) returns to London. Dixon arrives at the station late, but so does Christine. Christine tells Dixon that she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) knows of Bertrand's affair with Carol and has broken off their relationship. Dixon tells Christine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is through with Margaret. Dixon reveals the news about the job offer from Christine's uncle, Gore-Urquhart, and asks to return to London with Christine. As they walk down the street, they run into the Welch family, whom Dixon salutes with an explosive laugh of contempt.
