Evans changes the topic to the young Anne Page, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) would like to see Slender marry. They arrive at Master Page's door, where Shallow confronts Falstaff and his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) entourage. The men enter to dine, but Slender drifts around outside, trying unsuccessfully to converse with Anne Page until he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) goes inside. Falstaff and his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) entourage settle in at the Garter Inn, where Falstaff reveals his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) plan to seduce Mistress Page and Mistress Ford, both of whom have control over their husband's money, which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) desires. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sends Pistol and Nim to deliver letters to the women, but they refuse. Instead they plot to stymie Falstaff's plans by telling Page and Ford of his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) intentions. Mistress Quickly talks to Slender's servant Simple, sent by Evans, and agrees that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) will consent to speak positively of Slender to Anne Page. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Page</b></font>) master, Doctor Caius, enters and encounters Simple. When he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hears about his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) errand, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) becomes angry and drafts a letter to Evans. Caius too is in love with Anne Page and blames Evans for encouraging Slender; hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) challenges him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) to a duel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) threatens Quickly, who had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Page</b></font>) would encourage Anne to look favorably on him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>). Later Fenton enters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>)'s also in love with Anne and wants to know if Quickly has related his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>) affections to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Mistress Page enters with a letter from Falstaff. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>)'s astonished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) has the gall to try to seduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) and wonders how she (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) will seek revenge. Mistress Ford appears with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) own letter, which they discover is exactly the same. They decide to lead Falstaff on until he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) is ruined and humiliated. Mistress Ford agrees to anything that won't harm her (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) honor. Meanwhile, Pistol and Nim enter, conversing with Ford and Page; they reveal Falstaff's plans. The husbands are astonished. Page doesn't think his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) wife will fall for Falstaff, but Ford is horribly jealous and convinced his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) wife will dishonor him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>). Shallow and the Host of the Garter Inn enter with news of a fight between Caius and Evans. Page goes with them to watch, while Ford makes a deal with the Host to be introduced to Falstaff in disguise, in order to find out how far Falstaff has gotten in his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) plan. At the Garter Inn, Quickly enters with a message from Mistresses Ford and Page for Falstaff. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) reports that Ford will be out the next morning, and Mistress Ford will be expecting a visit from him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>). Mistress Page has not yet gotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) husband to leave the house, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>)'ll make a date at a later time. Then Ford enters in disguise, announced under the name Brooke. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tells Falstaff that he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>)'s in love with Mistress Ford, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) has always rebuffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) advances, claiming that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>)'s too honorable to cheat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asks Falstaff to seduce Mistress Ford, thus destroying her (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) honor, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) won't be able to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) down in the future. Falstaff reports his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) date the next morning with Mistress Ford. Alone, Ford curses his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) wife for preparing to cheat on him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) and thinks Page is foolish to trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) wife. Caius awaits Evans for their duel, but Evans is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Evans has been wandering around looking for Caius. They meet and prepare to fight. The other men take their swords away, and Caius and Evans speak quietly to each other of their suspicion that the Host has plotted to make them look like fools because he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) scorns Evans for his (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) Welsh accent and Caius for his (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) French one. They agree to work together to get revenge against the Host. On the way back from the fight, the men discuss Anne's marriage options. Page says he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) favors Slender, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) wife prefers Caius. What about Fenton?, asks one, but Page dismisses him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) entirely. Ford invites the men back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) house to catch Falstaff. Falstaff has arrived at Mistress Ford's house; he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) hides when Mistress Page is announced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) comes in and speaks loudly of the imminent arrival of Ford, who angrily suspects his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) wife of cheating. Falstaff comes out and asks them to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) flee. They hide him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) in a laundry basket. Ford and his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) buddies enter as Mistress Ford's men carry the laundry out. Ford is unable to find Falstaff, and the Mistresses are doubly delighted to have fooled both Falstaff and Ford. They decide to humiliate Falstaff further in the service of making Ford get over his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) jealousy. Fenton and Anne Page speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) says her (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) father objects to him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) suspects him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) of just wanting Anne's money, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) is high-born but poor. Fenton admits that that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>) intention at first, but, since getting to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>) has come to feel differently. Shallow, Slender, and Quickly enter; Quickly draws Fenton away, while Shallow tries to get Slender to talk to Anne. Slender only makes a fool of himself by speaking nonsense. Page and his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wife enter, and they invite the favored Slender inside. Fenton asks Quickly to continue to campaign on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>) behalf with Anne. Alone, Quickly notes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) likes him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>) better than the other two men who have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to sway Anne's opinion. Falstaff arrives at the Garter Inn, soaked after having been thrown in the river with the laundry. Quickly enters with a second invitation from Mistress Ford. Ford enters in disguise as Brooke and asks how Falstaff's date with Mistress Ford went. He (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) tells how it ended, but says he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) is visiting again that night! Falstaff returns to Mistress Ford's house, and again Mistress Page enters soon after. Falstaff hides, and Mistress Page warns Mistress Ford of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) husband's approach. How will they hide Falstaff this time? He (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) emerges and refuses to go in the laundry again. Mistress Ford suggests that he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) wear the clothes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) servant's fat aunt to escape in disguise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) does, and when Ford arrives, he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) beats Falstaff and chases him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) away because he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) hates the fat aunt. Mistress Ford and Mistress Page are pleased; they think they have proven their point, and so they decide to tell their husbands of their schemes. Ford apologizes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) wife for his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) jealousy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) promises never to suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) again. They decide that it would be fun to work together to humiliate Falstaff publicly. They plan to have Mistress Ford invite Falstaff to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) in an allegedly haunted wood, and they'll dress their children up as ghosts and monsters to terrify and embarrass Falstaff. Then, having caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) in the act of trying to meet Mistress Ford secretly, they can tell the story all around town. Fenton speaks to the Host of a letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>) has received from Anne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) says that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) parents want to use the chaos of disguised children in the haunted wood as an opportunity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) suitors to elope with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to run off with Caius and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father prefers Slender. Each instructs her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to wear a specific outfit so each suitor may find her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) intends to deceive them both. Fenton asks the Host to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>) find a vicar who will marry them that night. Meanwhile, Caius and Evans avenge themselves on the Host by stealing three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) horses in a scheme that had him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) believing he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) had lent the horses to three German lords on their way to the royal court. Falstaff arrives in the haunted woods. The disguised children hide and wait. Ford and Page and their friends arrive to watch, and Mistress Ford and Mistress Page approach Falstaff. He (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>)'s delighted to see they have both come to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>). Then they hear a noise and the women run away. Falstaff is surrounded by disguised elves and ghouls and is terrified. Mistress Quickly, playing the fairy queen, says they should try to burn the human they have encountered, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) doesn't burn then he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) is pure. They burn Falstaff with candles and encircle him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) and pinch him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>). Finally, the disguised children depart, and Page and Ford enter. Falstaff sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) has been fooled and humiliated. Evans tells Falstaff that he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) should give up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) lusts and tells Ford that he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) should trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) wife. Meanwhile, they all wonder where Anne is. Slender arrives upset; in the confusion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) eloped with a young boy in Anne's outfit. Then Caius enters, in a rage that he (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) has married a boy wearing Anne's assigned color outfit. Then Anne herself enters with Fenton. Fenton scolds the Pages for having thought to send Anne into a marriage without love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>) and Anne have long been in love, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>) says, and now it has been finalized. Ford says that love has won out, and Page and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenton</b></font>) wife realize their mistake in not having listened to the wishes of their daughter. Falstaff is pleased that their plan to humiliate him (<font color='blue'><b>Falstaff</b></font>) backfired partially in the marriage of Anne and Fenton. They adjourn to celebrate the marriage and invite Falstaff to join them.
