small Southern town, Bertram Cates is behind bars, awaiting trial
for teaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) students about Darwin's theory of evolution. Rachel
Brown, a friend and fellow teacher who also is the daughter of the
town's minister, visits Cates. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brings Cates some clean clothes
and urges him (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) to plead guilty and throw himself at the mercy of
the court. Cates remains firm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) resolve. Hillsboro erupts with excitement as prominent lawyers
and journalists arrive for the trial. E. K. Hornbeck, a critic for
the Baltimore Herald, surveys the scene and makes
wisecracks. The Bible-thumping politician Matthew Harrison Brady,
who leads the prosecution, arrives to a warm welcome from the townspeople
and a picnic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brady</b></font>) honor. Brady meets with Reverend Brown, District
Attorney Tom Davenport, and the mayor. Brady also holds a confidential
discussion with Rachel about her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) friendship with Cates. Rachel leaves
the discussion feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) has betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) friend. Hornbeck informs the crowd that the prominent litigator
Henry Drummond will represent the defense. The mayor names Brady
an honorary colonel in the state militia. Reverend Brown and the mayor
discuss how they might prevent Drummond from entering Hillsboro.
When the crowd disperses, Rachel and Hornbeck discuss Hornbeck's
columns, which portray Cates as a hero. Around sunset, Hornbeck
greets Drummond, who has just arrived in town. A few days later, Drummond, Brady, Davenport,
and the judge conduct jury selection. They accept the illiterate
Mr. Bannister. Brady makes a joke about Drummond's bright purple
suspenders, but Drummond turns the tables by revealing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) bought
the suspenders in Brady's Nebraska hometown. As jury selection continues,
Brady rejects Mr. Dunlap, a fervent supporter of Brady. Drummond
mockingly objects to Brady's honorary title of <div class="bookquote">``colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brady</b></font>)</div>so the
judge grants Drummond the same title to even the score. Brady and
Drummond accept Sillers, a feed store employee, as a juror. Drummond,
who argues that the evolutionist movement should be given the same amount
of attention as the fundamentalist movement, notes that the townspeople
have erected a sign commanding <div class="bookquote">``Read Your Bible!''  (<font color='red'><b>the townspeople</b></font>)</div>in the town square
and have advertised prayer meetings. Frustrated by Drummond's demands,
the judge declares the court in recess. A crowd of admirers surrounds Brady as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brady</b></font>) leaves the courtroom,
but no one dares to come near Drummond. Before Drummond leaves the
courtroom, Rachel expresses to him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) concerns about the trial.
Cates relates the hardships he (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) has endured since his (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) arrest. Drummond,
who empathizes with Cates's struggle and isolation, offers Cates
the opportunity to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) plea on one condition: that Cates
truly believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) has done wrong. Cates decides to persevere for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) cause. Rachel, however, informs them that Brady has asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) to
testify against Cates. A frantic Cates returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) cell, concerned about
the details of personal conversations that Rachel might betray. Drummond
reassures Rachel that Brady is less powerful than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) believes.
Assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) that Cates is fighting for a worthy cause, Drummond
compliments Rachel on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) strength in loving Cates. On the courthouse lawn, Brady leads a group of reporters
to a prayer meeting that Reverend Brown is about to conduct. Brady tells
the reporters about his (<font color='blue'><b>Brady</b></font>) former friendship with Drummond. Brown begins
the prayer meeting with a quick recitation of the creation story
presented in Genesis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) proceeds to incite the crowd into a frenzy. The
climax of Reverend Brown's rant is an incantation to bring the fires
of hell down on Cates. When Rachel protests, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) father requests
the same curse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>). Brady, disturbed by Brown's zeal, interrupts
and reminds the preacher of the Christian doctrine of forgiveness. Brady
calls the prayer meeting to an end and then speaks to Drummond about
their old ties and how they have drifted apart. Two days later, in the courtroom, Brady questions thirteen-year-old
Howard Blair about Cates's teaching. Howard confirms that Cates
taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) that humans descended from <div class="bookquote">``Old World Monkeys''  (<font color='red'><b>humans</b></font>)</div>and that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) teachings on creation omitted any reference to God. Cross-examining
Howard, Drummond asks the boy about evolutionary theory. The prosecution
objects, but Drummond claims he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) is trying to establish the basic
human right to think. The prosecution and the judge counter that
the trial is not about the right to think. Drummond asks Howard
whether evolutionary theory has harmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>), and the question confuses
the boy. Drummond asks Howard if he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) believes what Cates taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>).
Howard says he (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) hasn't made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) mind. Drummond then asks the boy
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) thinks of modern technological advances that are not mentioned
in the Bible. Howard is again confused, and Brady objects. Drummond
rails against Brady's absolute notions of right and wrong. Drummond
asks Howard if he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) understands what is being discussed. When the
boy says no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) is dismissed. The prosecution calls Rachel to the stand. To explain
why Cates stopped attending church, Rachel tells the story of Tommy
Stebbins. An intellectually curious boy, Stebbins was one of Cates's
favorite students. When Stebbins drowned in a local river,
Rachel's father preached that the boy would suffer eternal damnation
because his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) parents never had him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) baptized. Upset both by the death
of the boy and the preacher's reaction, Cates stopped going to church.
Brady asks Rachel further questions about her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) discussion of Cates's
ideas, but Rachel falters and becomes visibly upset. The prosecution
rests its case. Drummond attempts to call several expert scientists to
testify about evolutionary theory, but the judge says that their
testimony is inadmissible. Drummond shifts gears and calls Brady
to the stand as an expert on the Bible. Asking Brady several questions
about Biblical passages that defy the tenets of modern science,
Drummond catches Brady off balance and gains the support of the
crowd. As Drummond exposes contradiction after contradiction in
Brady's views, Brady becomes hysterical and begins to shout names
from the Bible. Davenport objects, and the judge adjourns the court. The next day, just before the jury reads its verdict,
Cates and Drummond discuss Cates's chances. A radio reporter enters
the courtroom to set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) equipment. The mayor takes the judge
aside and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) that political forces in the state are growing
worried about media coverage of the trial. The mayor implicitly
tells the judge to pass a light sentence. The jury hands their verdict
to the judge, who declares Cates guilty and fines him (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>) $100.
The prosecution objects to the light sentence. Drummond demands
an appeal, and the judge grants him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) thirty days to prepare it. The judge adjourns the court. Brady tries to read some
prepared remarks, but the spectators in the courtroom begin to leave.
Brady tries to deliver the speech to the radio reporter, but the
reporter says that the station producer has cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Brady</b></font>) off. Brady has
a mental breakdown and must be carried out of the courtroom as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brady</b></font>)
deliriously recites what sounds like a presidential campaign victory
speech. Hornbeck mocks Brady, while Cates expresses concern for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cates</b></font>). Meeker, the bailiff, tells Cates that Hornbeck and the BaltimoreHerald have
posted $500 for Cates's
bail. Rachel tells Cates that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) has decided to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) father
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) has overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) fear of thinking for herself. Word
arrives that Brady has died of a <div class="bookquote">``busted belly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brady</b></font>)</div>and Cates, Rachel,
and Drummond decide to leave together on the train out of town that
evening.
