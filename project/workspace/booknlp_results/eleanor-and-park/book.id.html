The book is in the third person, and the narrative alternates between Eleanor's perspective and Park's perspective. Eleanor Douglas is a tenth-grader who has just transferred to a new high school. Eleanor stands out from the rest of the students in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) appearance, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``big and awkward,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>has curly red hair, and wears men's clothes with unusual accessories. No one wants to make room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) on the bus, but Park eventually lets her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) sit next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>). Eleanor is extremely smart and sharp, particularly excelling in English class. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) home life, however, is deeply troubled. Eleanor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) abusive and alcoholic stepfather Richie, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) four younger siblings, live in poverty. All the kids have to share one bedroom, and they can't afford a phone. Eleanor has just returned back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) house after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) the evil Richie kicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) out for a year. Richie terrorizes the whole family. Eleanor's mom wants to be a peacemaker and pretend that everything is fine, even though Richie is violent and abusive. Eleanor doesn't feel safe at home. Fellow tenth-grade Park Sheridan feels like an outsider as well, though, unlike Eleanor, the other kids don't really tease him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>). Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>)'s lived in Omaha his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>) whole life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>) doesn't feel any deep connection to the other students at school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>) is Asian American, which is very rare in Omaha, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>) likes music and comic books. Park's home life is much more welcoming than Eleanor's, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>) parents have a loving relationship and they have a comfortable lifestyle. However, Park faces tensions at home, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>) dad wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>) to be more masculine, and Park always feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>)'s letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheridan</b></font>) down When Eleanor sits down on the bus next to Park, they are both sullen and resentful of the situation, especially since they both know the unspoken social code that once you choose your bus seat, you're locked in to it for the year. Soon, however, this changes radically. Eleanor and Park slowly begin to form a connection over the course of their bus rides. They first build their relationship silently by listening to music and reading comic books together. Eventually, their relationship grows, they start talking, and their bus rides become the best parts of their days. When they finally hold hands, sparks fly. Park and Eleanor become infatuated with each other. Park tells Eleanor that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), and Eleanor expresses her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) affection in many ways, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) doesn't ever say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) back. Though Eleanor and Park's relationship blossoms, other parts of their lives do not go as well. Eleanor gets bullied at school, especially in the gym locker room, where the other girls cover her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) locker in sanitary pads and flush her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) clothes in the toilet. Park beats up Steve, a bully, for leading taunts against Eleanor. Eleanor's home life also gets worse and worse. When Eleanor hears gunshots one night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) calls the police, which makes Richie angrier than ever. Park and Eleanor both display some range of gender expression. Eleanor likes to wear men's ties and shirts. Park's mom has a tough time accepting Eleanor at first, because Eleanor doesn't care about traditionally feminine beauty standards. But when Park's mom realizes the hardships that Eleanor has been through, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) can relate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) sees that Eleanor is good for Park. Park discovers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) enjoys wearing eyeliner, which makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) dad furious, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) dad wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) to be more traditionally masculine. However, when Park sticks up for Eleanor and comes into his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) own as a confident person, Park's dad eventually accepts Park for who he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) is. The climax of the story comes when Eleanor returns home one night, just after she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) and Park kiss, to find that Richie destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) box of private possessions, which include mix tapes Park had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) and makeup from Park's mom. Richie leaves Eleanor a threatening note, which makes Eleanor realize that Richie has been the one leaving lewd messages all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) textbooks that year. Eleanor escapes from the house. Two of the biggest bullies at school, Tina and Steve, help her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) out even though they've never been nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) before because they can see that Richie is pure evil. Eleanor realizes that the one person she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) might be able to live with is her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) uncle in Minnesota, and Park immediately offers to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) there. Eleanor and Park have a very bittersweet trip, because they know it might be the last time they see each other for a long time. After they part, Park tries sending letters and packages to Eleanor, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) is too upset to even let herself open them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) never replies. Eventually, a heartbroken Park tapers off communication and tries to move on. At the very end of the novel, Eleanor finally writes Park a postcard that contains just three words. These words are not disclosed to the reader.
