the fall of Troy, and the Greek hero Odysseus still has not returned
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) kingdom in Ithaca. A large and rowdy mob of suitors who have
overrun Odysseus's palace and pillaged his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) land continue to court
his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) wife, Penelope. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) has remained faithful to Odysseus. Prince
Telemachus, Odysseus's son, wants desperately to throw them out
but does not have the confidence or experience to fight them. One
of the suitors, Antinous, plans to assassinate the young prince,
eliminating the only opposition to their dominion over the palace. Unknown to the suitors, Odysseus is still alive. The beautiful nymph
Calypso, possessed by love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>), has imprisoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) island,
Ogygia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) longs to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) wife and son, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) has no ship
or crew to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) escape. While the gods and goddesses of Mount
Olympus debate Odysseus's future, Athena, Odysseus's strongest supporter
among the gods, resolves to help Telemachus. Disguised as a friend
of the prince's grandfather, Laertes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) convinces the prince to
call a meeting of the assembly at which he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) reproaches the suitors.
Athena also prepares him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) for a great journey to Pylos and Sparta,
where the kings Nestor and Menelaus, Odysseus's companions during
the war, inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) that Odysseus is alive and trapped on Calypso's
island. Telemachus makes plans to return home, while, back in Ithaca,
Antinous and the other suitors prepare an ambush to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Telemachus</b></font>) when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Telemachus</b></font>) reaches port. On Mount Olympus, Zeus sends Hermes to rescue Odysseus from
Calypso. Hermes persuades Calypso to let Odysseus build a ship and
leave. The homesick hero sets sail, but when Poseidon, god of the
sea, finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) sailing home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) sends a storm to wreck Odysseus's
ship. Poseidon has harbored a bitter grudge against Odysseus since
the hero blinded his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, earlier in his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>)
travels. Athena intervenes to save Odysseus from Poseidon's
wrath, and the beleaguered king lands at Scheria, home of the Phaeacians. Nausicaa,
the Phaeacian princess, shows him (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) to the royal palace, and Odysseus
receives a warm welcome from the king and queen. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) identifies
himself as Odysseus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) hosts, who have heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) exploits at
Troy, are stunned. They promise to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) safe passage to Ithaca, but
first they beg to hear the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) adventures. Odysseus spends the night describing the fantastic chain
of events leading up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) arrival on Calypso's island. He (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) recounts
his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) trip to the Land of the Lotus Eaters, his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) battle with Polyphemus
the Cyclops, his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) love affair with the witch-goddess Circe, his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) temptation by
the deadly Sirens, his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) journey into Hades to consult the prophet Tiresias,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) fight with the sea monster Scylla. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) finishes his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>)
story, the Phaeacians return Odysseus to Ithaca, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) seeks out
the hut of his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) faithful swineherd, Eumaeus. Though Athena has disguised
Odysseus as a beggar, Eumaeus warmly receives and nourishes him (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>)
in the hut. He (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) soon encounters Telemachus, who has returned from
Pylos and Sparta despite the suitors' ambush, and reveals to him (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) true identity. Odysseus and Telemachus devise a plan to massacre
the suitors and regain control of Ithaca. When Odysseus arrives at the palace the next day, still
disguised as a beggar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) endures abuse and insults from the suitors.
The only person who recognizes him (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) old nurse, Eurycleia,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) swears not to disclose his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) secret. Penelope takes an interest
in this strange beggar, suspecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) long-lost
husband. Quite crafty herself, Penelope organizes an archery contest
the following day and promises to marry any man who can string Odysseus's
great bow and fire an arrow through a row of twelve axes--a feat
that only Odysseus has ever been able to accomplish. At the contest,
each suitor tries to string the bow and fails. Odysseus steps up
to the bow and, with little effort, fires an arrow through all twelve
axes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) then turns the bow on the suitors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) and Telemachus, assisted
by a few faithful servants, kill every last suitor. Odysseus reveals himself to the entire palace
and reunites with his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) loving Penelope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) travels to the outskirts
of Ithaca to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) aging father, Laertes. They come under attack
from the vengeful family members of the dead suitors, but Laertes,
reinvigorated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) son's return, successfully kills Antinous's
father and puts a stop to the attack. Zeus dispatches Athena to
restore peace. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) power secure and his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) family reunited, Odysseus's
long ordeal comes to an end.
