The Marquise de Merteuil decides, therefore, to construct a little intrigue for her (<font color='blue'><b>Merteuil</b></font>) own amusement and the amusement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Merteuil</b></font>) former lover, the Vicomte de Valmont. The Marquise is aware that a young girl of good family, Cécile Volanges, has only just left the convent so that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can be married to the Comte de Gercourt. Now, the Marquise has a bone to pick with this particular Comte, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suggests to the Vicomte that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquise</b></font>) seduce and debauch Cécile to create a scandal and humiliate Gercourt. Valmont accepts the Marquise's proposal somewhat coolly, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquise</b></font>) already has his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquise</b></font>) eyes on another prey, the highly religious Présidente de Tourvel, the chaste wife of a member of Parliament. But, never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont suggests that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tourvel</b></font>) and the Marquise enter into a slightly different bet: if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquise</b></font>) can obtain written proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquise</b></font>) has slept with the Présidente, the Marquise must yield herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquise</b></font>). Meanwhile, Cécile has been presented to society, and in society she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) meets the charming and gentle Chevalier Danceny. Danceny becomes Cécile's music teacher and slowly, with a little coaxing from the Marquise de Merteuil, the two young people fall in love. During this time, Valmont is out in the country on his (<font color='blue'><b>Merteuil</b></font>) aunt's estate, trying to turn the Présidente de Tourvel's head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tourvel</b></font>) has very little luck in this department despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Tourvel</b></font>) use of every known trick in the book. Then, as coincidence would have, Cécile's mother, Madame Volanges, who corresponds regularly with the Présidente de Tourvel, happens to say some rather unflattering things about Valmont in a letter which Valmont just happens to steal and read. And thus it is that Valmont resolves to seduce the little Volanges as revenge for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's only too accurate trash-talk. Cécile's <div class="bookquote">``seduction''  (<font color='red'><b>Cécile</b></font>)</div>would be more accurately termed <div class="bookquote">``rape,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cécile</b></font>)</div>but the girl is persuaded to enter into a bizarre student-teacher relationship with Valmont, so that for a while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is being courted by Danceny and <div class="bookquote">``loved''  (<font color='red'><b>Danceny</b></font>)</div>nightly by Valmont. During his (<font color='blue'><b>Tourvel</b></font>) time as Cécile's teacher, Valmont is also able to win the heart of the Présidente de Tourvel. However, the Marquise de Merteuil is not so easily pleased. Rather than encourage the Vicomte de Valmont to meet the conditions of their original agreement, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mocks him (<font color='blue'><b>Merteuil</b></font>) for having fallen in love with the Présidente de Tourvel. Valmont's pride does not withstand these attacks very well, and to avoid compromising his (<font color='blue'><b>Tourvel</b></font>) reputation as a good-for-nothing gigolo, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tourvel</b></font>) leaves the Présidente cold, with no explanation. Cécile fares no better, after a particularly rough night in Valmont's room, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) miscarries his (<font color='blue'><b>Tourvel</b></font>) child. Now things are really looking bad for everyone involved. The Présidente de Tourvel removes herself to a convent where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) proceeds to die of grief and shame. Merteuil and Valmont are never able to reconcile their little snit and can only agree to go to war with one another. Danceny learns that Valmont seduced Cécile and challenges him (<font color='blue'><b>Tourvel</b></font>) to a duel; and Danceny wins the duel. Valmont hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tourvel</b></font>) correspondence with the Marquise to Danceny on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquise</b></font>) deathbed; all of society learns of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) schemes and machinations. The Marquise is forced to flee town and, like a wicked old witch, is never heard from again. Full of regret for her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) activities with Valmont, Cécile returns to the convent from whence she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) came, with the intention of becoming a nun.
