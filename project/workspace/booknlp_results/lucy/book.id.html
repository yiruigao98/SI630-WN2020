with high hopes for the future, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) instantly grows disillusioned upon arriving
in America to work as an au pair for an affluent family, whose
lives, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>), seem incredibly charmed. After years of dreaming of escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>)
birthplace, she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) new surroundings cold and mundane and suffers intense
homesickness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) dismisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) former dreams of a better existence as mere
fantasies. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) always felt out-of-place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) native land, she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) experiences
extreme isolation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) new country, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) likes her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) employers, Lewis and
Mariah, and wants one day to emulate their happy family life, her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) initial attempt to
reach out to them breeds only misunderstanding. Lucy grows closer to Mariah but also marvels at the differences between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
impoverished colonial background and Mariah's privileged circumstances. Despite
Lucy's frequent memories of home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) speaks bitterly of those she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) left behind and
focuses increasingly on thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, toward whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feels great
animosity and only occasional tenderness. As Lucy emerges from a hard winter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
gains confidence that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has truly begun her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) new life. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), Mariah, and
Mariah's four daughters take a trip to the Great Lakes, however, Lucy sees ways in
which Mariah, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) mother, tries to control her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) and Mariah have
disparate views on everything from dining cars and plowed fields to Indian
heritages and fish, and Lucy regards Mariah's pampered perspective of
the world with a mixture of rage and pity. Summer brings another trip to the Great Lakes, this time with Lewis joining
the family, and Lucy develops a deep affection for Lewis and Mariah's youngest
daughter, Miriam, who reminds her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) childhood and happier times with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>)
mother. Mariah, too, continues to resemble Lucy's mother in both good and bad ways.
Noting something amiss in Lewis and Mariah's relationship, Lucy pledges her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) loyalty
to Mariah and thinks back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) own sexual awakening, which involved much physical
pleasure but little emotional investment. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) good friend, Peggy, back in the
city, Lucy experiences loneliness but also enjoys the warm weather and the lakeside
picnics with the children. The arrival of Dinah, Mariah's vain and envious best
friend, puts Lucy on guard, but Lucy takes quickly to Hugh, Dinah's brother,
developing a sexual relationship with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) that pleases her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) enormously, but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
insists, arouses no love. Meanwhile, Mariah and Lewis's marriage deteriorates into
frequent fighting, and Lucy catches Lewis nuzzling Dinah. By the end of the summer,
Lucy feels little nostalgia about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) time at the lake and easily says her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) goodbyes. Upon returning to the city, Lucy, jaded from the summer's revelations about
Lewis and Mariah, abandons her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) plans to attend school and become a nurse and
despairs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) chances of eluding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) mother's influence. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) refuses to
open her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) mother's letters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) doesn't discard them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) increasingly believes
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) has become her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) mother's clone. Due to their differences, tensions between Peggy
and Lucy grow, and when Lucy falls for Peggy's co-worker, Paul, Peggy disapproves,
further harming their friendship. But because Peggy wants to escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) family and
Lucy has tired of living under Lewis and Mariah's roof, they overlook their problems
to discuss getting an apartment together. Paul and Lucy see a lot of each other,
spending most of their time in bed, but when Lucy decides to buy a camera and take
up photography, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) follows the camera salesman home and sleeps with him (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>). Soon
after, Paul declares his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love for Lucy, who doesn't share his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feelings. Mariah and
Lewis argue constantly, and not long after Mariah kicks Lewis out, Lucy discovers,
from a fellow countrywoman, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father has died, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother penniless.
Overcome with emotion, Lucy sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother money, along with a vitriolic letter
detailing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother's many transgressions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) burns the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) receives in
return, along with the other letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s saved. During a
discussion with Mariah, Lucy reveals how her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) once her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brothers
arrived. To help Lucy resolve her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feelings for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, Mariah gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) some
feminist tomes, but Lucy finds them useless in addressing the loss of the one great
love of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) life. The death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father intensifies Lucy's wish to move away from Mariah, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) announces her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) impending departure, Mariah becomes angry, starts treating
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) less like a friend than a servant, and gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariah</b></font>) a cool farewell. A year after
Lucy's arrival in America, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) once again finds herself embarking on a fresh start,
and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) appreciates having her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own place and belongings, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) changed
circumstances please her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) less than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'d hoped. Peggy proves an irritating roommate,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) office job falls short of her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) expectations, and Paul's constant presence at her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>)
new home annoys her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>). Before Mariah moves away, Lucy and Mariah have a pleasant
visit, but Lucy wonders if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'ll ever see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) again. Peggy and Paul appear to
develop a secret relationship, but Lucy feels so disconnected from them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
hardly minds. Having finally achieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) independence, Lucy wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
the capacity to experience profound love.
