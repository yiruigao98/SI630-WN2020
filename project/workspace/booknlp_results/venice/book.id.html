Determinedly cerebral and duty-bound, he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) believes that true art is produced only in <div class="bookquote">``defiant despite''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of corrupting passions and physical weaknesses. When Aschenbach has the urge to travel, he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) tells himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) might find artistic inspiration from a change of scene. Aschenbach's subsequent trip to Venice is the first indulgence he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) has allowed himself in years; it signals the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) decline. Aschenbach allows the languid Venetian atmosphere and gently rocking gondolas to lull him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) into a defenseless state. At his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) hotel he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) notices an extremely beautiful fourteen-year-old Polish boy named Tadzio, who is visiting with his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) mother, sisters, and governess. At first, Aschenbach's interest in the boy is purely aesthetic, or so he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tells himself. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) soon falls deeply and obsessively in love with the boy, although the two never have direct contact. Aschenbach spends days on end watching Tadzio play on the beach, even following his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) family around the streets of Venice. Cholera infects the city, and although the authorities try to conceal the danger from the tourists, Aschenbach soon learns the facts about the lethal epidemic. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cannot bear to leave Tadzio and stays on in Venice. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) becomes progressively daring in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pursuit of the boy, gradually becoming more and more debased, until he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) finally dies of the cholera, degraded, a slave to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) passions, stripped of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dignity.
