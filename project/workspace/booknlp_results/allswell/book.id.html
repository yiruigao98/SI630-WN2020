Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) beauty and worth, Helena has no hope of attracting Bertram, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) is of low birth and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) is a nobleman. However, when word comes that the King is ill, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) goes to Paris and, using her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) father's arts, cures the illness. In return, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) is given the hand of any man in the realm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) chooses Bertram. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) new husband is appalled at the match, however, and shortly after their marriage flees France, accompanied only by a scoundrel named Parolles, to fight in the army of the Duke of Florence. Helena is sent home to the Countess, and receives a letter from Bertram informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) will never be her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) true spouse unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) can get his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) family ring from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) finger, and become pregnant with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) child--neither of which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) declares, will ever come to pass. The Countess, who loves Helena and approves of the match, tries to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), but the distraught young woman departs Rousillon, planning to make a religious pilgrimage. Meanwhile, in Florence, Bertram has become a general in the Duke's army. Helena comes to the city, and discovers that her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) husband is trying to seduce the virginal daughter of a kindly Widow. With the connivance of the daughter, named Diana, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) contrives to trick Bertram: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) gives Diana his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) ring as a token of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) love, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) room at night, Helena is in the bed, and they make love without him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) realizing that it is her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>). At the same time, two lords in the army expose Parolles as a coward and a villain, and he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) falls out of Bertram's favor. Meanwhile, false messengers have come to the camp bearing word that Helena is dead, and with the war drawing to a close, Bertram decides to return to France. Unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), Helena follows, accompanied by Diana and the Widow. In Rousillon, everyone is mourning Helena as dead. The King is visiting, and consents to Bertram marrying the daughter of an old, faithful lord, named Lafew. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) notices a ring on Bertram's finger that formerly belonged to Helena--it was a gift from the King after she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) saved his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) life. -LRB-Helena gave the ring to Diana in Florence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) in turn gave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) would-be lover.-RRB- Bertram is at a loss to explain where it came from, but just then Diana and her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) mother appear to explain matters--followed by Helena, who informs her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) husband that both his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) conditions have been fulfilled. Chastened, Bertram consents to be a good husband to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>), and there is general rejoicing.
