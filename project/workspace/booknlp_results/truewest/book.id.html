His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) brother, Lee, a scruffy drunk, arrives to the house and pesters Austin. Lee is not there for house-sitting, however, but for stealing. Lee's only interest at first is to rob the houses in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) mother's neighborhood of household appliances. Though Austin protests, there is not much he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) can do to stop his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) brother. Austin simply requests that Lee be out of the house when a movie producer comes to visit later in the day. While the producer, Saul Kimmer, is still in the kitchen with Austin, Lee returns, carrying a stolen television set. Rather than leave, Lee talks the producer into a game of golf and convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) to take a look at the outline of a story Lee has been thinking about. That night, Austin helps his (<font color='blue'><b>Austin</b></font>) brother type out a ridiculous scenario involving two men chasing each other through <div class="bookquote">``Tornado Country.''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>The brothers stay up late into the night working on the outline for Saul Kimmer. The next day, after the golf game, Lee comes home in high spirits. As part of a gamble Lee has struck with Saul on the golf course, Saul has agreed to produce Lee's project and drop Austin's. To add insult to injury, Saul wants Austin to write the screenplay for Lee's ridiculous western. Austin initially does not believe the strange turn of events, but Saul comes to the house and explains the situation. Lee's scenario is hot, while Austin's scenario is old and tired. That night Austin gets horribly drunk while Lee tries to type out the screenplay to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) movie idea. The two brothers discuss the fact that Saul seems to think the two of them are the same person. Austin mocks Lee for not being able to write a screenplay, while Lee bets Austin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) could not even steal a toaster. As the action of the play continues the brothers gradually begin to transform into one another. This transformation is marked by extensive talk about their father, who has run away from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life in the suburbs and now lives out in the desert. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life has been domestic and respectable up to this point, Austin now begins to feel the pull of the desert. Chaos descends upon the kitchen: the next morning finds Austin polishing thirty toasters he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has stolen from neighborhood houses overnight and Lee smashing the typewriter with Saul's golf club. Austin expresses a great need to get away from the suburbs and to live in the desert. He (<font color='blue'><b>Austin</b></font>) begs Lee to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) to the desert. Lee agrees, but only on the condition that Austin help him (<font color='blue'><b>Austin</b></font>) write the screenplay. The brothers begin to write in earnest. Lee stalks around the kitchen and Austin scribbles furiously at a pad. They are both incredibly drunk. Without warning, Mom arrives home early from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) trip to Alaska. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) kitchen ruined and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) houseplants dead. The brothers, not sure what to do, apologize about the mess and ask Mom about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) trip. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) came home early because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) houseplants again and because Picasso was supposed to be coming to town. Austin changes the subject, announcing that the brothers are going to go to the desert. Lee, however, says that is not the case. Lee tries to go but Austin strangles him (<font color='blue'><b>Austin</b></font>) with a telephone cord. Mom has had enough and leaves for a motel. When Austin thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Austin</b></font>) has killed Lee he (<font color='blue'><b>Austin</b></font>) begins to go. Lee, however, jumps up quickly and blocks his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) brother's exit.
