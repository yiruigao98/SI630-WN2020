Angelo is left in charge by the Duke, who pretends to leave town but instead dresses as a friar to observe the goings-on in his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) absence. Angelo is strict, moralistic, and unwavering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) decision-making; he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) decides that there is too much freedom in Vienna and takes it upon himself to rid the city of brothels and unlawful sexual activity. Laws against these behaviors and institutions already exist, and Angelo simply decides to enforce them more strictly. Claudio is arrested for impregnating Juliet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudio</b></font>) lover, before they were married. Although they were engaged and their sexual intercourse was consensual, Claudio is sentenced to death in order to serve as an example to the other Viennese citizens. Isabella, Claudio's sister, is about to enter a nunnery when her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother is arrested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is unfailingly virtuous, religious, and chaste. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) hears of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother's arrest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) goes to Angelo to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) for mercy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) refuses, but suggests that there might be some way to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) mind. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) propositions her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) will let Claudio live if she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) agrees to have sexual intercourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Claudio</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is shocked and immediately refuses. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother agrees at first but then changes his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mind. Isabella is left to contemplate a very important decision. Isabella is, in a way, let off the hook when the Duke, dressed as a friar, intervenes. He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) that Angelo's former lover, Mariana, was engaged to be married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) dowry in a shipwreck. The Duke forms a plan by which Isabella will agree to have sex with the Angelo, but then Mariana will go in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mariana</b></font>) place. The next morning, Angelo will pardon Claudio and be forced to marry Mariana according to the law. Everything goes according to plan, except that Angelo does not pardon Claudio, fearing revenge. The provost and the Duke send him (<font color='blue'><b>Claudio</b></font>) the head of a dead pirate, claiming that it belonged to Claudio, and Angelo believes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) orders were carried out. Isabella is told that her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother is dead, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) should submit a complaint to the Duke, who is due to arrive shortly, accusing Angelo of immoral acts. The Duke returns in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) usual clothes, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) will hear all grievances immediately. Isabella tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) story, and the Duke pretends not to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). Eventually, the Duke reveals his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) dual identity, and everyone is forced to be honest. Angelo confesses to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) misdeeds, Claudio is pardoned, and the Duke asks Isabella to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Claudio</b></font>).
