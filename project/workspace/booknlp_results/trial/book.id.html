K. is indignant and outraged. The morning happens to be that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) thirtieth birthday. One year later, on the morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) thirty-first birthday, two warders again come for K. They take him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) to a quarry outside of town and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) in the name of the Law. K. lets them. The Trial is the chronicle of that intervening year of K.'s case, his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) struggles and encounters with the invisible Law and the untouchable Court. It is an account, ultimately, of state-induced self-destruction. Yet, as in all of Kafka's best writing, the <div class="bookquote">``meaning''  (<font color='red'><b>Kafka</b></font>)</div>is far from clear. Just as the parable related by the chaplain in Chapter Nine -LRB-called <div class="bookquote">``The Doorkeeper''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Before the Law'' (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>-RRB- elicits endless commentary from students of the Law, so has The Trial been a touchstone of twentieth-century critical interpretation. As some commentators have noted, it has, in parts, the quality of revealed truth; as such it is ultimately unresolvable--a mirror for any sectarian reading. How to summarize this kind of text? It was written during 1914-1915, while Kafka was an official in the Workmen's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. On one level we can see in The Trial a satirical pillorying of the Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy of Kafka's day. Yet to many readers it is eerily prescient of the psychological weaponry used by the much more insidious totalitarian regimes to come, of the legally-sanctioned death machines Kafka never lived to see. It is also an unfinished novel, and this is apparent in the final chapters. It is at times as suffocating to read as the airless rooms of the Court that it describes. The German title, Der Prozess, connotes both a <div class="bookquote">``trial''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and a <div class="bookquote">``process,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and it is perhaps this maddening feeling of inevitability that leaves a lasting visceral impression: the machinery has been set in motion, and the process will grind toward conclusion despite our most desperate exhortations.
