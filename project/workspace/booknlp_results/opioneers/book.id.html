The narrator introduces four principal characters: the very young Emil Bergson; his (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) stalwart older sister, Alexandra; her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>) gloomy friend Carl Linstrum; and a pretty little Bohemian child, Marie Shabata. From town, Emil and Alexandra and their neighbor Carl return home to the desolate stretch of plains known as the Divide. Alexandra's father, John Bergson, is dying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bergson</b></font>) tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Bergson</b></font>) two eldest sons, Oscar and Lou, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bergson</b></font>) is entrusting the farmland, and the preservation of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bergson</b></font>) has accomplished since his (<font color='blue'><b>Bergson</b></font>) immigration from Sweden, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bergson</b></font>) daughter. It becomes clear that Alexandra is stronger and more resolute than her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>) brothers. When drought and depression strike three years later, Alexandra's determination allows her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>) to persevere. Many families, including Carl Linstrum's, sell their farms and move away. But Alexandra believes in the promise of the untamed country, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>) convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>) brothers to re-mortgage their farm and buy more land. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>) also convinces them to adopt innovative farming techniques. The narrative jumps sixteen years into the future, when Alexandra's faith in the land has been repaid. Lou and Oscar are married, and each owns his (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>) own farm. Alexandra's farm is the most prosperous on the Divide. Emil has been provided the wealth and luxury to leave the Divide for the State University. Crazy Ivar, the elderly, slightly imbalanced man who, earlier in the novel, gave Alexandra some controversial farming advice, now works in Alexandra's stables, although Lou and Oscar disapprove of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>) presence. Amid this underlying tension, Carl Linstrum returns for a long visit after years of travel. /PARAGRAPH. Meanwhile, Marie Shabata is trapped in an unhappy marriage with a sullen and difficult husband, and it becomes clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Shabata</b></font>) and Emil are falling in love. Emil decides to travel to Mexico City, fleeing the temptation that Marie presents. Alexandra and Carl slowly regain their teenage intimacy. In reaction, Lou and Oscar drive Carl out of town, fearing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Carl</b></font>) relationship with Alexandra might threaten their own children's prospects of inheriting Alexandra's farm. Emil returns from Mexico nearly a year later, only to find that his (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) love for Marie has grown during their separation. Once again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) resolves to flee the Divide. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) can leave, though, tragedy strikes: his (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) best friend, Amedee, dies unexpectedly. At a church mass, Emil enters a state of rapture and resolves to say farewell to Marie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) in a similar ecstasy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) orchard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) lies down next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) jealous husband, Frank Shabata, finds them. Blinded by fury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) shoots them both dead. Months after the murders, Alexandra Bergson has achieved some limited recovery from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>) sorrow; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>) now possesses a stoic exhaustion with life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>) resolves to try to win a pardon for Frank, who is serving a ten-year sentence in a Lincoln jail. Returning from a visit to Frank in Lincoln, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>) finds Carl Linstrum waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandra</b></font>). As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Linstrum</b></font>) heard of Emil's death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) returned from Alaska. They find comfort and companionship in each other, and they decide to marry.
