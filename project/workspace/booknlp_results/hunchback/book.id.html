He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) is hoisted on a throne and paraded around Paris by the jeering mob. Pierre Gringoire, a struggling poet and philosopher, tries unsuccessfully to get the crowd to watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) play instead of the parade. Archdeacon Claude Frollo appears and stops the parade and orders Quasimodo back to Notre Dame with him (<font color='blue'><b>Claude</b></font>). Looking for something to eat, Gringoire admires the graceful beauty of La Esmerelda, a gypsy street dancer, and decides to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) home. After rounding a corner, she (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) is suddenly attacked by Quasimodo and Frollo. Gringoire rushes to help her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) but is knocked out by Quasimodo as Frollo runs away. The King's Archers, led by Phoebus de Chateaupers arrive just in time and capture the hunchback. Later that night, a group of beggars and thieves are about to hang Gringoire when La Esmerelda comes forward and offers to save his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) life by <div class="bookquote">``marrying''  (<font color='red'><b>La Esmerelda</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) for four years only. The next day, Quasimodo is put on trial and sentenced to two hours of torture in the Place de Grève. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) suffers both the pain of being stretched and pulled apart as well as being publicly humiliated by the crowd of people, who hate him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) ugliness. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) begs for water, but no one answers his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) pleas until La Esmerelda comes forth and brings him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Sister Gudule, screams at La Esmerelda for being a <div class="bookquote">``gypsy child- thief''  (<font color='red'><b>Gudule</b></font>)</div>and blames her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Esmerelda is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Phoebus calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) over to him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) has fallen in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) and blushes when he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) later that night. Frollo watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Phoebus. His (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) obsessive lust for La Esmerelda has made him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) secret cell at Notre Dame, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) plans to trap La Esmerelda like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) follows Phoebus to his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) tryst with La Esmerelda and stabs Phoebus repeatedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) escapes and La Esmerelda is captured by the King's guard. After being tortured at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) trial, La Esmerelda falsely confesses to killing Phoebus and being a witch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) is sentenced to hang in the Place de Grève. Frollo visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) in jail and declares his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) love. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) begs her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) to love him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and show him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) some pity but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) calls him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``goblin-monk''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) execution, La Esmerelda is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) suddenly sees Phoebus and calls out his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) name. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was injured. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) turns away from La Esmerelda and enters the house of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) bride-to-be. Just then, Quasimodo swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) back to the cathedral, crying out <div class="bookquote">``Sanctuary!''  (<font color='red'><b>Notre Dame</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had fallen in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) water and had been planning her (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) escape all along. La Esmerelda is safe from execution just as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) stays inside the cathedral. At first, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) finds it hard to even look at Quasimodo, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is deaf, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) enjoys being around her (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Esmerelda after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) be removed from Notre Dame. But when Quasimodo sees them attack the cathedral, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) thinks they have come to kill La Esmerelda and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fends them off as best he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) can, killing a large number of them. Frollo has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Esmerelda out of the cathedral. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) offers her (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) two choices: she (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) can either say she (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) or be hanged. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) demands to be executed and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>bride-to-be</b></font>) with Sister Gudule. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Gudule tries to protect La Esmerelda, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Quasimodo goes to the top of the north tower to find her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). Gazing off into the distance, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sees the figure of La Esmerelda in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) bellows out in despair and grabs Frollo by the neck. Holding him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) up in the air, Quasimodo sighs with grief and then throws Frollo down to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) death. Looking at La Esmerelda hanging off in the distance and Frollo's wrangled corpse down below, Quasimodo cries out: <div class="bookquote">``There is everything I ever loved!''  (<font color='red'><b>Quasimodo</b></font>)</div>Quasimodo is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Esmerelda's remains, he (<font color='blue'><b>gravedigger</b></font>) finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
