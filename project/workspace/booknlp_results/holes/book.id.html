Stanley and the other boys at the camp are forced to dig large holes in the dirt every day. Stanley eventually realizes that they are digging these holes because the Warden is searching for something. As Stanley continues to dig holes and meet the other boys at the camp, the narrator intertwines three separate stories to reveal why Stanley's family has a curse and what the Warden is looking for. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Warden</b></font>) was a boy, Stanley's great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, received a pig from Madame Zeroni, a gypsy, in exchange for a promise. Elya's promise was that after the pig grew strong he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) would carry Madame Zeroni, who only had one leg, up a mountain and sing her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a song that she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>). After becoming disillusioned with the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) loved, however, Elya hops a boat to America, forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) promise to Madame Zeroni. Elya marries and has a child in America and always thinks about Madame Zeroni, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) believes has cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) failure to fulfill his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) promise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) knows that Madame Zeroni's son lives in America, but Elya never finds him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). One hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake, the town of Green Lake is a beautiful place where peach trees bloom throughout the spring. In this Texas town, the schoolteacher, Katherine Barlow, falls in love with Sam, the onion seller. Sam sells onions to eat and to use for medicinal purposes. While Katherine and Sam are alive, racism is institutionalized in the United States and it is against the law for a black man to kiss a white woman. Because Sam is black and Katherine is white, the people in the town become irate when they find that Katherine and Sam have kissed. Charles, or Trout, Walker, the richest man in town has always wanted to marry Katherine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is already mad that Katherine does not wish to go out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) finds out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) is in love with Sam he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) gathers the townspeople to burn the schoolhouse and attack Sam. Katherine seeks help from the local sheriff but instead finds that the sheriff, who makes lewd advances towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>), also wants to kill Sam. Katherine and Sam attempt to escape but their boat is destroyed while only half way across the lake and Sam is killed. Katherine is driven mad by her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) grief and becomes an outlaw known as Kissin' Kate Barlow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) name refers to the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) kisses the men she (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) kills, leaving a lipstick imprint of her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) lips on their faces. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) twenty years of robbing people in the west, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) happens to rob Stanley's great- grandfather while he (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) is on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) way from New York to California. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katherine</b></font>) buries Stanley's great-grandfather's money somewhere and even though Charles Walker and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) wife Linda try to torture her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) into revealing its location, Kate dies before anyone can find out where the money is hidden. After the day that Sam is killed, rain stops falling on Green Lake and the lake dries up. Because Green Lake dries up, the citizens of the town all move away and by the time that the land is serving as Camp Green Lake, the only people there are juvenile delinquents. Stanley has a hard time digging holes there due to the incredible heat and the hard, dry land. At one point Stanley digs up half of a lipstick tube that has the initials KB on it. Stanley knows that the Warden, who happens to be a descendent of Charles and Linda Walker, is interested in this find and he (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) speculates that perhaps Kate Barlow used to live in the area. The other boys at the camp are tough and all have nicknames. Stanley tries to stay in the good graces of X-Ray, the obvious leader of the group but this becomes harder as Stanley becomes better friends with a boy named Zero. Although Stanley and Zero, also known as Hector Zeroni, do not know it, Hector is the great- great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni. Zero eventually runs away from camp and Stanley, in an effort to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>), follows after a few days. The two help each other to reach the top of a big mountain, which turns out to be Sam's old onion field. Because Zero is very weak, Stanley carries him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) up this mountain. They survive on onions for more than a week and then return to camp, planning to search for Kate Barlow's treasure in the hole where Stanley found the lipstick tube. Stanley and Zero find a suitcase that has the name Stanley Yelnats on it. Although the Warden attempts to take the suitcase from them, Stanley's lawyer, Ms. Morengo, arrives to say that Stanley has been proven innocent and Stanley and Hector are able to leave the camp with the suitcase. It turns out that the suitcase contains many valuable items and is in fact the same suitcase that Kate Barlow took from Stanley's great-grandfather, also named Stanley Yelnats, so many years ago. At the end of the book, it seems that the Yelnats family curse is lifted. Hector is reunited with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) mother, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) was separated many years ago and Stanley's father finally succeeds in inventing something: a cure for foot odor. While at Camp Green Lake, Stanley has improved his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) physical strength and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) self-confidence in addition to making a true friend. While fate has so often seemed against Stanley, in the end it serves to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) family, and Hector.
