At the outset of the story, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is living in India with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parents--a dashing army captain and his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) frivolous, beautiful wife--but is rarely permitted to see them. They have placed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) under the constant care of a number of native servants, as they find her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) too hideous and tiresome to look after. Mary's circumstances are cast into complete upheaval when an outbreak of cholera devastates the Lennox household, leaving no one alive but herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is found by a group of soldiers and, after briefly living with an English clergyman and his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) family, Mary is sent to live in Yorkshire with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) maternal uncle, Archibald Craven. Misselthwaite Manor is a sprawling old estate with over one hundred rooms, all of which have been shut up by Archibald Craven. A man whom everyone describes as <div class="bookquote">``a miserable hunchback,''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>Master Craven has been in a state of inconsolable grief ever since the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wife ten years before the novel begins. Shortly after arriving at Misselthwaite, Mary hears about a secret garden from Martha Sowerby, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) good-natured Yorkshire maidservant. This garden belonged to the late Mistress Craven; after her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) death, Archibald locked the garden door and buried the key beneath the earth. Mary becomes intensely curious about the secret garden, and determines to find it. This curiosity, along with the vigorous exercise she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) takes on the moor, begins to have an extremely positive effect upon Mary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) almost immediately becomes less sickly, more engaged with the world, and less foul-tempered. This change is aided by Ben Weatherstaff, a brusque but kindly old gardener, and a robin redbreast who lives in the secret garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) begins to count these two <div class="bookquote">``people,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>along with Martha, Dickon Sowerby, and Susan Sowerby, as the friends she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) has had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) curiosity is whetted when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) hears strange, far-off cries coming from one of the manor's distant rooms. However, Mrs. Medlock, the head of the servants at Misselthwaite, absolutely forbids her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) to seek out the source of the cries. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) is distracted from this mystery when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) discovers, with the robin's help, the key to the secret garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) immediately sets about working there, so that the neglected plants might thrive. Dickon, who brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) a set of gardening tools and promises to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) bring the secret garden back to life, vastly aids her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) endeavor. Dickon is a boy who can charm the animals of the moor <div class="bookquote">``the way snake charmers charm snakes in India.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon a boy charm</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is only a common moor boy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is filled with so much uncanny wisdom that Mary comes to refer to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``the Yorkshire angel.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>One night, Mary hears the distant cries and, flagrantly disobeying Mrs. Medlock's prohibition, goes off in search of their source. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) finds Colin Craven, Master Craven's invalid son, shut up in an opulent bedchamber. Colin was born shortly before his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mother's death, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father cannot bear to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) because the boy painfully reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) late wife. Colin has been bedridden since his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) birth, and it is believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) will become a hunchback and die an early death. His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) servants have been commanded to obey his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) every whim, and Colin has become fantastically spoiled and imperious as a result. Colin and Mary strike up a friendship, but Colin becomes furious when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fails to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) prefers to garden with Dickon. That night, Colin throws one of the infamous tantrums. Mary rushes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room in a fury and commands him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to stop crying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) back is beginning to show a hunch; when Mary examines him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) finds nothing whatever the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). Henceforth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will maintain that Colin's illness is only in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mind: he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) will be well if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) makes up his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mind to be. Dickon and Mary secretly begin bringing Colin out into the secret garden. On the first of these outings, the children are discovered by Ben Weatherstaff, who has been covertly tending the secret garden once a year for ten years. Ben has done so out of love and loyalty for the late Mistress Craven: he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was a favorite of hers. Weatherstaff refers to Colin as <div class="bookquote">``the poor cripple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div>and asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) has crooked legs and a crooked back. Colin, made furious by this question, forces himself to stand up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own feet for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) life. After this feat, Colin's health improves miraculously: the secret garden, the springtime, and Dickon's company have the same rejuvenating effect upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) that they did upon Mary. The children determine to keep Colin's improvement a secret, however, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) can surprise his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) recovery when Master Craven returns from his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) trip abroad. The three children, along with Ben Weatherstaff, spend every day of the summer in the secret garden. Only one other person is admitted into the secret: Susan Sowerby, Dickon's saintly mother. Susan sends a letter to Master Craven, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) to hurry home so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) might see his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) son; she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) does not, however, specify why, in deference to Colin's secret. Master Craven complies, and returns immediately to Misselthwaite. His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) first act is to go into the secret garden; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) does so at the behest of a dream in which the voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) late wife told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) might find her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lays his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand to the doorknob, Colin comes rushing out and falls into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arms. Father and son are reconciled, and the miracle of Colin's recovery becomes known to all.
