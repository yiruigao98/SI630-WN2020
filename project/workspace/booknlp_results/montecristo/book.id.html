Dantès seems to have the perfect life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) is about to become the
captain of a ship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) is engaged to a beautiful and kind young woman, Mercédès,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) is well liked by almost everyone who knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>). This perfect
life, however, stirs up dangerous jealousy among some of Dantès's
so-called friends. Danglars, the treasurer of Dantès's ship, envies
Dantès's early career success; Fernand Mondego is in love with Dantès's
fiancée and so covets his (<font color='blue'><b>Mondego</b></font>) amorous success; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mondego</b></font>) neighbor Caderousse
is simply envious that Dantès is so much luckier in life than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>)
is. Together, these three men draft a letter accusing Dantès
of treason. There is some truth to their accusations: as a favor
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) recently deceased captain, Dantès is carrying a letter from
Napoleon to a group of Bonapartist sympathizers in Paris. Though
Dantès himself has no political leanings, the undertaking is enough
to implicate him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) for treason. On the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) wedding, Dantès
is arrested for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) alleged crimes. The deputy public prosecutor, Villefort, sees through
the plot to frame Dantès and is prepared to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) free. At the
last moment, though, Dantès jeopardizes his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) freedom by revealing
the name of the man to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) is supposed to deliver Napoleon's
letter. The man, Noirtier, is Villefort's father. Terrified that
any public knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's treasonous activities will
thwart his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own ambitions, Villefort decides to send Dantès to prison
for life. Despite the entreaties of Monsieur Morrel, Dantès's kind
and honest boss, Dantès is sent to the infamous Château d'If, where
the most dangerous political prisoners are kept. While in prison, Dantès meets Abbé Faria, an Italian
priest and intellectual, who has been jailed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) political views.
Faria teaches Dantès history, science, philosophy, and languages,
turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Faria</b></font>) into a well-educated man. Faria also bequeaths to Dantès
a large treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) tells
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) how to find it should he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) ever escape. When Faria dies, Dantès
hides himself in the abbé's shroud, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) will be buried
and then dig his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) way out. Instead, Dantès is thrown into the sea,
and is able to cut himself loose and swim to freedom. Dantès travels to Monte Cristo and finds Faria's enormous
treasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) considers his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) fortune a gift from God, given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>)
for the sole purpose of rewarding those who have tried to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>)
and, more important, punishing those who have hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>). Disguising himself
as an Italian priest who answers to the name of Abbé Busoni, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
travels back to Marseilles and visits Caderousse, who is now struggling
to make a living as an innkeeper. From Caderousse he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) learns the
details of the plot to frame him (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>). In addition, Dantès learns that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) father has died of grief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) absence and that Mercédès has
married Fernand Mondego. Most frustrating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) learns that both Danglars
and Mondego have become rich and powerful and are living happily
in Paris. As a reward for this information, and for Caderousse's
apparent regret over the part he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) played in Dantès's downfall, Dantès
gives Caderousse a valuable diamond. Before leaving Marseilles,
Dantès anonymously saves Morrel from financial ruin. Ten years later, Dantès emerges in Rome, calling himself
the Count of Monte Cristo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) seems to be all knowing and unstoppable.
In Rome Dantès ingratiates himself to Albert de Morcerf, son of Fernand
Mondego and Mercédès, by saving him (<font color='blue'><b>Mondego</b></font>) from bandits. In return for
the favor, Albert introduces Dantès to Parisian society. None of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) old cohorts recognize the mysterious count as Edmond Dantès,
though Mercédès does. Dantès is thus able to insinuate himself effortlessly
into the lives of Danglars, Mondego, and Villefort. Armed with damning
knowledge about each of them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) has gathered over the past
decade, Dantès sets an elaborate scheme of revenge into motion. Mondego, now known as the Count de Morcerf, is the first
to be punished. Dantès exposes Morcerf's darkest secret: Morcerf
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) fortune by betraying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) former patron, the Greek vizier
Ali Pacha, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) then sold Ali Pacha's wife and daughter into slavery. Ali
Pacha's daughter, Haydée, who has lived with Dantès ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>)
bought her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) freedom seven years earlier, testifies against Morcerf in
front of the senate, irreversibly ruining his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) good name. Ashamed by
Morcerf's treachery, Albert and Mercédès flee, leaving their tainted
fortune behind. Morcerf commits suicide. Villefort's punishment comes slowly and in several stages. Dantès
first takes advantage of Madame de Villefort's murderous intent,
subtly tutoring her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in the uses of poison. As Madame de Villefort
wreaks her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) havoc, killing off each member of the household in turn,
Dantès plants the seeds for yet another public exposé. In court,
it is revealed that Villefort is guilty of attempted infanticide,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) tried to bury his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) illegitimate baby while it was still alive. Believing
that everyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) loves is dead and knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) will soon have
to answer severe criminal charges, Villefort goes insane. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) revenge on Danglars, Dantès simply plays upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) enemy's greed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) opens various false credit accounts with Danglars that
cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) vast amounts of money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) also manipulates Danglars's unfaithful
and dishonest wife, costing Danglars more money, and helps Danglars's
daughter, Eugénie, run away with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) female companion. Finally,
when Danglars is nearly broke and about to flee without paying any
of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) creditors, Dantès has the Italian bandit Luigi Vampa kidnap
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) and relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) remaining money. Dantès spares Danglars's
life, but leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) penniless. Meanwhile, as these acts of vengeance play out, Dantès
also tries to complete one more act of goodness. Dantès wishes to
help the brave and honorable Maximilian Morrel, the son of the kind
shipowner, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) hatches an elaborate plot to save Maximilian's
fiancée, Valentine Villefort, from her (<font color='blue'><b>fiancée</b></font>) murderous stepmother, to
ensure that the couple will be truly happy forever. Dantès gives
Valentine a pill that makes her (<font color='blue'><b>fiancée</b></font>) appear dead and then carries her (<font color='blue'><b>fiancée</b></font>)
off to the island of Monte Cristo. For a month Dantès allows Maximilian
to believe that Valentine is dead, which causes Maximilian to long
for death himself. Dantès then reveals that Valentine is alive.
Having known the depths of despair, Maximilian is now able to experience
the heights of ecstasy. Dantès too ultimately finds happiness, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dantès</b></font>) allows himself to fall in love with the adoring and beautiful
Haydée.
