women in their forties return to their home state of Arkansas to meet the
then-governor, Bill Clinton. Melba, the narrator and author, explains that the
group, called the Little Rock Nine, is visiting Central High School in Little Rock.
As teenagers in 1957, the nine of them were the first African-American students to
be integrated into the school. When Melba is twelve years old, the Supreme Court rules that separate schools
for whites are illegal, a ruling called Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka,
Kansas. In the year after the ruling, Melba sees very little change in segregation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) is still at an all-black high school, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) and sixteen other black students
sign up to attend the white school. Because of the threat of violence, the number of black students who will
participate in the integration is decreased from seventeen to nine. Several times in
the few days before school is supposed to start, lawsuits are filed that threaten to
stop the nine students. Governor Faubus declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) is going to send the
Arkansas National Guard to the high school, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guard</b></font>) does not say whether they are
there to protect the nine or to stop them from entering the school. Grandma India
begins to stay awake at night with a shotgun near her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>). Finally, a few days after
school has started, federal court judge Ronald Davies orders that the students be
allowed to attend. On September 3, 1957, Melba and her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) mother drive to Central High School for
Melba's first day of class. A huge white mob has gathered, and the Arkansas National
Guard encircles the school. Luckily, both Melba and her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) mother make it to the car
and escape unharmed. Melba is not allowed to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) house or answer the door or
the phone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) grandmother that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) wants to go back to Horace Mann, her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>)
old high school, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) grandmother insists that Melba is not a quitter. President Eisenhower and Governor Faubus meet and attempt to resolve the
problem of integration in Arkansas, but the meeting is unsuccessful, and on
September 20, 1957, the State of Arkansas goes to federal court before Judge Davies.
Judge Davies rules that the Arkansas National Guard must be removed and that the
Little Rock Nine must be allowed into Central High School. Governor Faubus removes
the guard and predicts that blood will run in the streets of Little Rock if the
schools are integrated. On Monday, September 23, 1957, Melba and the other black students go to
school. They are again greeted by a mob of angry white people. In the middle of one
class, Melba is forced to flee to the principal's office, as the mob has broken the
barricades and is headed for the school. Someone in the principal's office proposes
that they give the crowd one of the children to kill so the others can escape. Gene
Smith, the assistant chief of police, smuggles the nine students out of the school.
The day after the mob attack, Melba stays home and reads that President Eisenhower
has announced he (<font color='blue'><b>Eisenhower</b></font>) will use force to prevent this kind of mob rule and to enforce
federal law. The next day, the 101st Airborne Division -LRB-a division of war heroes-RRB-
arrives in Little Rock. Each black student has his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) own escort from the 101st Airborne Division.
Melba's solider, Danny, protects her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) when someone attempts to throw acid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>)
eyes. In October, Melba, Ernie, and Minnijean meet with some of Central High's white
students under the guidance of a Norwegian reporter, Mrs. Jorumn Rickets, who hopes
to foster some sort of understanding between the two groups. The meeting is a
failure. Eisenhower withdraws the 101st Airborne, and the nine students are forced
to rely on the Arkansas National Guard for protection. The Nine continue to be
terrorized: one day, white girls attack Melba in the showers and hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) under
scalding water. At the same time, the newspaper that Mrs. Bates -LRB-the President of
the NAACP in Little Rock-RRB- runs is being financially ruined by white businesspeople,
and the State Attorney is threatening NAACP officials across the state. On December 17th, white boys surround Minnijean in the school cafeteria.
Minnijean throws hot chili on two of the boys. Minnijean is suspended. The
segregationists start a new chant: <div class="bookquote">``One nigger down and eight to go.''  (<font color='red'><b>The segregationists</b></font>)</div>Minnijean is
allowed to return to school, and a short while later, a white boy pours a bucket of
soup on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) head. Later, the boy who poured soup on Minnijean attacks her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), and a
fight ensues. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but the white students allege that
Minnijean fought back. Minnijean is expelled from Central High School, and three
white students are suspended. The NAACP arranges for a scholarship for Minnijean at
a high school in New York. One day, Melba is almost surrounded by a group of white boys led by Andy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>)
main tormentor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) is saved by a white boy named Link, who gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) the keys to
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) car. That night, Melba returns Link's car to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) begins to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) of
the plans that the segregationists have made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>). Melba and Link become friends.
On April 16, Judge Davies is removed from the Little Rock integration lawsuits and
replaced by an Arkansas judge named Harry Lemley. One Saturday morning, Link and Melba visit Nana Healey, Link's black nanny.
Link thinks that Nana Healey has tuberculosis. Melba finds a doctor in the black
community to tend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>). Nana Healey is dying, and Melba has to tell Link.
Meanwhile, the integration case is reopened, with Judge Lemley presiding, and the
school board once again asks for a postponement of integration at Central High
School. Melba's mother, Lois, is nearly fired from her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) teaching job of fourteen
years because Melba won't withdraw from Central High School. The end of the school
year is approaching, and the segregationists are desperate to keep Ernie, the oldest
of the nine, from graduating. Yet, on May 27, Ernie graduates. The next day, Link
calls in tears. Nana Healey has died. Link asks Melba to leave Little Rock with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ernie</b></font>).
Melba agrees to go, knowing she (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) will not follow through with her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) promise. By May 29, the Nine -LRB-including Minnijean-RRB- have begun a tour of the northern
states, where they are treated like heroes and celebrities. Meanwhile, the
integration effort in Little Rock is disintegrating. Judge Lemley grants the school
board's plea to delay integration for three years. The NAACP sets up a round of
appeals, and by September of 1958, the students are gearing up for their second year
at Central. Rather than allow that to happen, Governor Faubus shuts down all of
Little Rock's high schools. While Melba is waiting to return to school, Grandma
India is diagnosed with leukemia and dies in October of 1958. By September of 1959,
the NAACP has decided that the strain on the families is too great. They ask people
in NAACP chapters across the country to take in the students. Melba is sent to Santa
Rosa, California, to the home of the McCabes, a white Quaker family. The McCabes
nurture and care for Melba and convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) to go to college in January of 1960. In September of 1960, Central is again open to integration, but only two of
the nine students are readmitted. They eventually graduate. Melba begins to attend
San Francisco State University with predominantly white students. One night in 1962,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) is at school, a white soldier named John comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) room to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>)
roommate. There is mutual attraction, and soon they are engaged to be married. Melba
relates how she (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) keeps in touch with Link during this time. But when Link hears that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) is getting married, and to a white man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is furious, as Melba had always
maintained she (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) could not date a white man. They never speak again. Six months later,
Melba and John are married. They have a daughter named Kelli. Seven years after
their daughter's birth, they split up because Melba wants to be a reporter and work,
and John wants a housewife. Melba goes to journalism school at Columbia and becomes
a reporter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) ends the book by saying that if her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) experience at Central High
School has taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Melba</b></font>) anything, it is that we are all one.
