almost seven years old, the old healer Ultima comes to stay with
him (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) family in their small house in Guadalupe, New Mexico.
The family has taken in Ultima out of a respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) healing
powers, her (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) knowledge of plant lore, and her (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) long use of folk magic
in service of the community. Though they have great respect for
Ultima's spirituality, the family, especially Antonio's mother,
is devoutly Catholic. Antonio's father, Gabriel, is a former vaquero,
or cowboy, who wandered the llano, the great plains of New Mexico.
Antonio's mother, María, is the daughter of farmers. Antonio's parents
now argue about their young son's future; Gabriel hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) will
become a vaquero on the llano, and María hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) will become a
priest. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was born, Ultima served as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) midwife and buried
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) afterbirth. As a result, it is now thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) alone knows
what lies in Antonio's future. Antonio spends a happy time with Ultima, learning about
plants and trees and helping her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) gather herbs on the llano. One
night, his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) innocence is threatened when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) witnesses the death of
Lupito, a soldier who recently returned from World War II. Lupito
is shot to death by a mob after he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) kills the sheriff in a moment
of post-traumatic delirium. After seeing Lupito's death, Antonio
begins to wonder about sin, death, and hell. Antonio walks to church
with Ultima the next morning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) that each person
must make his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) own moral choices, must choose a set of values
to use to understand the world. That fall, after helping his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) mother's brothers, the Lunas,
with their harvest, Antonio begins school. María presses Ultima
to reveal Antonio's destiny, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replies sadly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) will
be a man of learning. The war ends, and Antonio's brothers return
home. Gabriel is overjoyed because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hopes the return of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) older
sons means that the family will at last be able to move to California,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) has longed to do. But the brothers are surly, restless,
and traumatized by the war. Before long, they each leave home to
pursue independent lives. Antonio struggles to understand the conflict
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) brothers, but like so many of the moral
questions that trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>), it is too complicated for him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) to grasp.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) mother tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) will understand when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) begins to take
Communion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) begins to look forward anxiously to the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>)
will be old enough to do so. Antonio's friend Samuel takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) fishing and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>)
the story of the golden carp, a river god who looks out for mankind.
Antonio is moved by the story, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) does not know how to reconcile
it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) Catholic beliefs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) beliefs are challenged again when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) uncle Lucas is cursed by the satanic Trementina sisters. The
priest is unable to cure him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), but Ultima, with Antonio's help, is
able to banish the curse. Antonio realizes that there is no way
to explain Ultima's powers within the worldview of the Catholic
church. Antonio goes to visit the garden of Narciso, the town
drunk. Afterward, they go to see the golden carp. Antonio's friend
Cico tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) that only true believers can see the carp. Cico says
that if the people cannot stop sinning, the carp will flood the
land to rid it of humanity's evil. Antonio wishes sadly that there
were a god of forgiveness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) idolizes the Virgin Mary because of
the ideal of forgiveness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) represents. One afternoon, Antonio witnesses an altercation between
Narciso and Tenorio, the father of the wicked sisters who cursed
Lucas. In a raging blizzard, Tenorio, who blames Ultima for the
death of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tenorio</b></font>) daughters, goes out to kill the old woman. Narciso
tries to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Tenorio</b></font>), and in front of Antonio, Tenorio shoots
and kills Narciso. Antonio comes down with a high fever and has
frightening and symbolic dreams. At last, the time comes for Antonio to begin preparing
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) Communion. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) seems to be surrounded by dissenting voices--that
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) father, who seems to worship the earth more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) does the
Christian God, and that of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) friend Florence, who incisively points
out the failings in Catholic thought. When Antonio finally takes
Communion on Easter Sunday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) feels no different than he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) felt before.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) still does not understand how there could be evil in the world
or what kind of forgiveness is possible in a world of sin. Ultima continues to teach Antonio lessons about moral
independence and goodness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) goes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) to dispel the ghosts
in a haunted house, and they discover that Tenorio has caused the haunting
in order to take revenge on the man who owns the house. Ultima drives
away the ghosts, but when the second of Tenorio's daughters falls
ill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tenorio</b></font>) begins to regard Ultima with even more hatred. Not long
after that, Florence drowns while swimming in the river. Ultima
sends Antonio to stay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) uncles to recover from the shock,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) spends a happy summer with them, learning how to tend a farm.
On the journey there, Antonio and Gabriel talk about some of the
questions that have been bothering Antonio, and Gabriel tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) will end the conflict between the Márezes and the Lunas
and let Antonio choose his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) own destiny. As Antonio makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) way from his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) uncles' fields to his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>)
grandfather's house one day toward the end of the summer, a murderous Tenorio
chases after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tenorio</b></font>). Antonio escapes, but Tenorio shoots Ultima's owl.
When the owl dies, Ultima is doomed to die as well because the owl
is her (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) spiritual familiar, or guardian. Antonio sits with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) bedside and buries the owl as she (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) requests after she (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>)
dies.
