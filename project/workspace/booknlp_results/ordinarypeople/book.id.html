The action focuses on the Jarrett family--Calvin and Beth and their son Conrad. Before the action of the book begins, there was a second Jarrett son--Buck--who was killed in a boating accident over a year before the novel begins. After the death of Buck, Conrad became deeply troubled, blaming himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) tried to commit suicide by slashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) wrists; his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) attempt failed when Calvin found him (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>), before he (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) died, in the bathtub. After the attempt, Conrad was hospitalized. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) went through therapy and befriended Karen, a girl his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) age who had also tried to kill herself. The action of the book begins a month after Conrad is released from the hospital. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) is physically cured, he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) is by no means emotionally cured, and at the request of his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) begins to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Berger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Berger</b></font>) tells Berger that he (<font color='blue'><b>Berger</b></font>) doesn't think highly of psychiatry, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Berger</b></font>) wants Berger to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Berger</b></font>) gain more control over others so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Berger</b></font>) can make his (<font color='blue'><b>Berger</b></font>) father stop worrying about him (<font color='blue'><b>Berger</b></font>). Conrad goes back to school, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) has experienced a severe academic downturn ever since Buck's death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) is a junior, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) is a member of the swimming team. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feels he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) is becoming alienated from even some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) best friends, such as Joe Lazenby, and ends up becoming more and more isolated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) decides to quit the swimming team, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) does not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) parents about the decision until a month later. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) spends his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) time instead in the library after school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) even goes out for a Coke with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) old friend Karen at one point, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sees that she (<font color='blue'><b>Karen</b></font>) is doing much better. As the year progresses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) becomes interested in a girl at school named Jeannine Pratt, who is new to Lake Forest. They go out a couple of times before they start to date seriously towards the end of the year. Meanwhile, Conrad continues to see Berger, although it is unclear whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) is making much progress. The novel focuses on his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) family life, and we see that Conrad is becoming increasingly alienated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) mother, who is not interested in pampering him (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) or dwelling on the past. His (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) relationship with his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) father is somewhat strained as well. During the winter, Conrad goes to see a swim meet on a whim, and afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) gets into a fist fight with an old friend who has begun to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) cruelly. In some ways, it is unclear whether Conrad is really getting better. His (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) father grows increasingly concerned about him (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>). That spring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) goes to stay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) grandparents while his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) parents go on vacation to Houston. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) spends lots of time with Jeannine. One night, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) reads in the newspaper that his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) friend Karen has committed suicide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) is suddenly thrown into shock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) spends the whole night in a dream-like trance thinking about his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) time with Karen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) own suicide attempt, and the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) goes out walking at 2 am to think some more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) is stopped by a police officer and told to return home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) falls back into a dream at home and then wakes up at dawn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) immediately calls Berger and requests to meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Berger</b></font>). In Berger's office, Conrad has a breakdown and admits that he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) blames himself for the death of Buck. Berger tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Berger</b></font>) to stop blaming himself and to stop trying to fill Buck's shoes; Conrad needs to allow himself to feel more even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) feels bad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) needs to be himself for a change. After this breakdown and release of emotion, Conrad begins to heal substantially, enjoying a great relationship with Jeannine. At the end of the novel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) has moved to Evanston with his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) family, and in the Epilogue we see him (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) rebuilding his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) old friendship with Lazenby. The story of Conrad is told opposite the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) father, Calvin, who spends most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) time in the novel worrying about Conrad. Calvin is a tax attorney who runs a small firm with his (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) partner, Ray Hanley. Most of the chapters devoted to Calvin depict him (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) by himself, thinking about the past and his (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) son and wife. It is clear from the beginning that Calvin and Beth have serious communication problems. Essentially, Calvin wants to talk through the past with his (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) family; he (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) believes that talking is the way to heal. Beth, however, abhors Calvin's philosophy: she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) only wants to move on and leave the past behind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) also constantly criticizes her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) husband for pampering Conrad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) thinks Conrad ought to be left to grow up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) own without parents breathing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) neck all the time. Indeed, Beth thinks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) managed to heal her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) own hurts on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) does not understand why everyone else can't do the same. Calvin and Beth attend parties together and spend lots of time with their own friends, and we see them in numerous situations. As the novel progresses, however, the communication rift between Beth and Calvin only widens. They fight more and more about how to treat Conrad. They also fight about vacations. Beth feels that the family must get away from Illinois for Christmas, but Calvin makes them stay in Lake Forest in hopes that they can talk through their problems as a family. In the spring, they take a golfing trip to Houston together; however, things blow up when Beth again rails on Calvin for his (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) obsession with Conrad. When they return to Illinois, they hardly speak to one another until Beth announces to Calvin that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) is leaving for Europe. While they do not talk about divorce, their differences seem irrevocable by the end of the novel. After Beth leaves, however, Conrad and Calvin really come together for the first time in the novel, saying that they love each other and showing an interest in developing a better relationship. Calvin and Conrad move to Evanston.
