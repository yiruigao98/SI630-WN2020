Devastated by the verdict, Blomkvist retreats to a café and ponders his (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>) conviction. He (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>) anticipates three months in prison, but he (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>) worries more about the fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>) political magazine, Millennium. After thinking the matter over, he (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>) meets with Erika Berger, Millennium's editor-in-chief and Blomkvist's lover, and announces his (<font color='blue'><b>journalist</b></font>) intention to leave the magazine. In the meantime, Lisbeth Salander, an unorthodox young woman with piercings and tattoos who works for Milton Security's private investigation division, attends a meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) boss, Dragan Armansky, and the lawyer Dirch Frode. Frode wishes to hire Blomkvist on behalf of Henrik Vanger, a wealthy industrialist and head of Vanger companies. Salander has compiled a report on Blomkvist and Frode wants to know the findings. Satisfied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) encourages Salander to continue her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) search into the Wennerström affair and calls Blomkvist to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) the job. Salander continues her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) research as requested and purchases an electronic cuff that will allow her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to monitor Wennerström's computer while Blomkvist considers the job offer. Burdened by concern for Millennium and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) own career, Blomkvist agrees to meet Henrik on December 26th to hear the details. Henrik explains his (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) family history and then, at length, presents the job offer: He (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) wants Blomkvist to write a history of the Vanger family as pretext for solving the murder of Henrik's great-niece, Harriet, who disappeared in 1966. Despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) interest in the mystery, Blomkvist feels reluctant to take the job since he (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) has more important things to worry about. Henrik sweetens the pot, however, promising to give Blomkvist devastating information about Wennerström upon Blomkvist's completing the job. As Millennium continues to lose advertising revenue, Blomkvist finally decides to take the offer as a way to repair the damage to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) career. Blomkvist makes the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) situation in Hedeby, the small island where the Vanger family resides, and attempts to decipher five mysterious names and numbers in Harriet's date book. Henrik also introduces him (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) to the other members of the Vanger family. Meanwhile, Salander encounters a problem when her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) guardian, Holger Palmgren, becomes critically ill. The new guardian appointed for Salander, Nils Bjurman, threatens to control her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) finances, treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with contempt, and forces her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to perform oral sex on him (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>). Furious, Salander decides to blackmail him (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) and records their next encounter. The encounter doesn't go as planned and Bjurman brutally rapes Salander. A week after the rape she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) home, handcuffs him (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) to the bed, and tortures him (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) threatens to publicize the recording of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) rape. Ultimately she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) extracts Bjurman's promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) will permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) access to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) finances and work to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) declared legally competent. Satisfied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tattoos a reminder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) perversion on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) abdomen and then leaves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is surprised when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) gets news that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is no longer needed to do research on the Wennerström affair. Thanks to a helpful hint from his (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) daughter, Pernilla, Blomkvist learns that the names and numbers in Harriet's date book refer to Bible verses, not phone numbers. Desperate to solve the mystery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) asks Frode for another researcher, and Frode recommends Salander. After Blomkvist reads Salander's report on him (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) and discovers that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hacked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) computer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nils</b></font>) visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at home and begs for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) help on the case. A wary, startled Salander complies and eventually the two discover that the names and numbers in Harriet's date book reference a series of gruesome serial killings. As they research and grow intimate, an unidentified assailant fires shots at Blomkvist and leaves a dismembered stray cat on the porch. Convinced that the assaults confirm they're close to a solution, Blomkvist tries to track down photographs of the Children's Day parade from the day of Harriet's disappearance. In the photos, Harriet is clearly dismayed, and Blomkvist hopes to discover who is causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) such distress. Salander departs for the Vanger family archives to make sense of small discrepancies in the serial killings, and Blomkvist finally finds his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) smoking gun: a photograph of Martin Vanger, Harriet's brother, from the Children's Day parade in 1966. At the climax of the novel, Blomkvist goes to Martin's cabin to confront him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). Martin, prepared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) arrival, escorts him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) at gunpoint to a makeshift dungeon in the basement. Martin beats Blomkvist and then admits that both he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) father share responsibility for the killings and that they tried to induct Harriet into the murderous tradition as well. To Blomkvist's surprise, however, Martin disavows any knowledge of what happened to Harriet and attempts to suffocate Blomkvist. Salander bursts in just in time and beats Martin severely with a golf club. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) escapes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) frees Blomkvist from his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bindings. Hurriedly Salander gives chase, but a desperate Martin drives his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) vehicle into the oncoming lane and dies in a fiery car accident. The next day, Salander, Blomkvist, and Frode agree that they will not notify the police about the murders. Putting together all the pieces, Blomkvist realizes that Harriet is not actually dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) contacts her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) shares her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) part of the story and reunites with Henrik. Later, when Frode informs Blomkvist that Henrik no longer wants to write the book and cannot offer any useful information on Wennerström--Blomkvist's whole reason for undertaking the project--Blomkvist falls into despair. At that point, Salander offers up the information she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)'s collected about Wennerström's corrupt financial dealings. As the novel ends, Blomkvist writes an expose about the Wennerström affair that upends the financial world, restores his (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) credibility, and reestablishes Millennium's security. Salander assumes a fake identity and drains several of Wennerström's accounts in order to secure financial independence in the future. Later, thanks to a tip from Salander, Wennerström resurfaces dead in a hotel room in Spain. Though Salander finally acknowledges her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feelings for Blomkvist and prepares to confess them on Christmas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Henrik</b></font>) out with Millennium's editor-in-chief, Erika Berger. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) decision to walk away from the situation indicates a lack of closure between the two of them despite their successful solving of the case.
