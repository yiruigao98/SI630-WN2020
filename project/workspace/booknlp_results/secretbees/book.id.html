Ray (8) <br />5	Boatwright (5) <br />3	Mary (3) <br /><h1>Text</h1><p/>Lily, a fourteen-year-old white girl, lives alone with
her father, a peach farmer, in Sylvan, South Carolina. As the novel
opens, she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) lies in bed, waiting for the bees that live in the walls
of her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) bedroom to emerge and fly around, as they do most nights.
T. Ray, her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) father, is abusive and does not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) story about
the bees. Her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) nanny and housekeeper, Rosaleen, believes Lily but
also thinks Lily is foolish for trying to collect the bees in a
jar. Lily recalls her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) very last memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) mother, Deborah, who
died when Lily was a small child. Lily thinks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) played a
horrible part in Deborah's death. In a flashback, readers learn
that T. Ray told Lily that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) accidentally shot Deborah while Deborah
and T. Ray were fighting one day. The next morning, Lily accompanies
Rosaleen into town, where Rosaleen intends to register to vote.
Instead, a group of racists harass Rosaleen, who winds up getting
arrested for affronting them. T. Ray picks up Lily at the prison
and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) that the men who accosted Rosaleen will most likely
kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). This news understandably frightens Lily, particularly
as Rosaleen is the only person in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) life who truly loves Lily.
At home, T. Ray tells Lily that on the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) died Deborah had
returned home to pick up just her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) clothes, intending to leave Lily
behind. Lily notices that the bees have escaped from the jar she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
put them in, which leads her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) to have an epiphany: she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) needs to run
away. Lily finds Rosaleen at the hospital, where Rosaleen has
been taken after being beaten up by the arresting police officers.
Together, Lily and Rosaleen hitchhike toward a town -LRB-Tiburon, S.C.-RRB-
that Lily has found written on the back of a picture of a black
Mary that once belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) mother. On the way, Lily feels free,
as if a new life has begun for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). Rosaleen feels annoyed that
Lily has broken the law only to head toward a town loosely associated
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) deceased mother. In Tiburon, Lily learns that the black
Mary picture comes from the label of a honey maker in town. Searching
for this honey maker, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) comes across the bright pink house of
August Boatwright and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) sisters. August invites Lily and Rosaleen
to stay, although Lily makes up a false story to explain their needs.
August decides that Rosaleen will help her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) sister May Boatwright
around the house and Lily will learn beekeeping. Soon Lily and Rosaleen become members of the community
centered around the Boatwright house: a close-knit group of African Americans,
mostly women, who call themselves the <div class="bookquote">``Daughters of Mary''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>and worship
a three-foot-tall statue of a black Mary. Lily meets the honey farm
helper, Zach, a handsome, intelligent, African American boy on whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) develops a crush. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) develops feelings for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) as well and buys
Lily a notebook in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) can write stories. Lily grows closer
and closer to August, beginning to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) and to find in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) a
surrogate mother. August urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) to open up about whatever led
Lily to end up in Tiburon, but Lily worries that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) will be sent
back to Sylvan if the truth comes out. Meanwhile, Lily also learns
how to care for bees and to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) own ingrained prejudices.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) visits a white lawyer in town who is helping Zach fulfill his (<font color='blue'><b>Zach</b></font>)
dream of becoming a lawyer. At the lawyer's office, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) breaks down
and calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) father. T. Ray is angry and indignant. The experience
makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) mother but also reaffirms her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) decision to run
away. On a very hot day, Lily asks May if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) ever knew anyone
named Deborah Fontanel and learns that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) has. With this, Lily
receives absolute confirmation that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) mother once spent time at
the Boatwright house. Lily is simultaneously eager to find out more
and anxious about exposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) true identity as Deborah's daughter.
On her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) way to talk to August, Lily decides instead to ride with
Zach into town to buy pieces for the car. There, Zach is amongst
a group of black boys that assault a white man, and the entire group
gets taken to jail. When Lily returns home, Clayton, the lawyer,
has arrived to tell the Boatwrights that Zach has been arrested.
They decide to hide the news from May, the most sensitive sister,
because they know how upset she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'d be. But May finds out and leaves
the house alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) commits suicide by drowning herself in the
river. The next week is taken up with mourning and a funeral. Once
another boy confesses, Zach is let out of jail, unpunished. Lily
fails to find a chance to speak to August. One morning, Lily wakes to find that it is Mary Day and
that the mourning is over. A two-day celebration begins. During
it, Lily finds herself alone with Zach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zach</b></font>) kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>), and they
vow to try to be together in the future, though they both recognize
that their union is, at present, impossible. Lily then goes to August's
room to wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). When August arrives, Lily tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) the truth
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) life, of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) ended up in Tiburon and of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) killed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) mother. August admits that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) has known Lily's true identity
all along and corroborates Lily's worst fear: that Deborah had already
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) returned home and was shot to death. Deborah had
gone to the house only to pick up her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) clothes. Feeling betrayed
and upset, Lily begins to mourn for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) mother. Days later, after
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) has recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) grief, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) father arrives at the Boatwright
house. Though T. Ray is angry and violent, Lily finally has the
strength to confront him (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) about the past and to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Daddy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>August convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) to let Lily stay in Tiburon. As T. Ray leaves, Lily asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) really killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) reports that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) did. However, Lily has come to realize
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>), just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) mother, is a flawed and complex human. In
a way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) forgives him (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) nevertheless feels happy to continue
living at the Boatwright house. In the fall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) returns to school,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) attends with Zach and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) makes other friends. August
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) community become Lily's new family, and, at long last, Lily develops
into a loved and loving person.
