mentally retarded thirty-two-year-old man, is chosen by a team of
scientists to undergo an experimental surgery designed to boost
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) intelligence. Alice Kinnian, Charlie's teacher at the Beekman
College Center for Retarded Adults, has recommended Charlie for
the experiment because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) exceptional eagerness to learn. The
directors of the experiment, Dr. Strauss and Professor Nemur, ask
Charlie to keep a journal. The entire narrative of Flowers
for Algernon is composed of the <div class="bookquote">``progress reports''  (<font color='red'><b>Algernon</b></font>)</div>that
Charlie writes. Charlie works at Donner's Bakery in New York City as
a janitor and delivery boy. The other employees often taunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
and pick on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), but Charlie is unable to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is
the subject of mockery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) believes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) coworkers are good
friends. After a battery of tests--including a maze-solving competition
with a mouse named Algernon, who has already had the experimental
surgery performed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)--Charlie undergoes the operation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is
initially disappointed that there is no immediate change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
intellect, but with work and help from Alice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) gradually improves
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) spelling and grammar. Charlie begins to read adult books, slowly
at first, then voraciously, filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) brain with knowledge from
many academic fields. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) shocks the workers at the bakery by inventing
a process designed to improve productivity. Charlie also begins
to recover lost memories of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) childhood, most of which involve
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mother, Rose, who resented and often brutally punished Charlie
for not being normal like other children. As Charlie becomes more intelligent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) realizes that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is deeply attracted to Alice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) insists on keeping their relationship
professional, but it is obvious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shares Charlie's attraction.
When Charlie discovers that one of the bakery employees is stealing
from Mr. Donner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is uncertain what to do until Alice tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
to trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) heart. Delighted by the realization that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is capable
of solving moral dilemmas on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) own, Charlie confronts the worker
and forces him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) to stop cheating Donner. Not long afterward, Charlie
is let go from the bakery because the other workers are disturbed
by the sudden change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), and because Donner can see that Charlie no
longer needs his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) charity. Charlie grows closer to Alice, though whenever
the mood becomes too intimate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) experiences a sensation of panic
and feels as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) old disabled self is watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). Charlie recovers
memories of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mother beating him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) for the slightest sexual impulses,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) realizes that this past trauma is likely responsible for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) inability to make love to Alice. Dr. Strauss and Professor Nemur take Charlie and Algernon
to a scientific convention in Chicago, where they are the star exhibits. Charlie
has become frustrated by Nemur's refusal to recognize his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) humanity.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) feels that Nemur treats him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) like just another lab animal, even
though it is disturbingly clear that Charlie's scientific knowledge
has advanced beyond Nemur's. Charlie wreaks havoc at the convention
by freeing Algernon from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) cage while they are onstage. Charlie
flees back to New York with Algernon and gets his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) own apartment,
where the scientists cannot find him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) realizes that Nemur's hypothesis
contains an error and that there is a possibility that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) intelligence
gain will only be temporary. Charlie meets his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) neighbor, an attractive, free-spirited
artist named Fay Lillman. Charlie does not tell Fay about his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) past,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is able to consummate a sexual relationship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). The
foundation that has funded the experiment gives Charlie dispensation
to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) own research, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) returns to the lab. However, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) commitment to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) work begins to consume him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) drifts away from Fay. Algernon's intelligence begins to slip, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) behavior
becomes erratic. Charlie worries that whatever happens to Algernon
will soon happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) as well. Algernon eventually dies. Fearing
a regression to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) previous level of intelligence, Charlie visits
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mother and sister in order to try to come to terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
past. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) finds the experience moving, thrilling, and devastating.
Charlie's mother, now a demented old woman, expresses pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
accomplishments, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sister is overjoyed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). However,
Rose suddenly slips into a delusional flashback and attacks Charlie
with a butcher knife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) leaves sobbing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) feels that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has
finally overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) painful background and become a fully developed individual. Charlie succeeds in finding the error in Nemur's hypothesis,
scientifically proving that a flaw in the operation will cause his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
intelligence to vanish as quickly as it has come. Charlie calls
this phenomenon the <div class="bookquote">``Algernon-Gordon Effect.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) passes through a
stage of average intelligence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) way back to retardation, Charlie
enjoys a brief, passionate relationship with Alice, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
away as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) senses the return of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) old self. When Charlie's regression
is complete, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) briefly returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) old job at the bakery, where
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) coworkers welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) back with kindness. Charlie forgets that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is no longer enrolled in Alice's
night-school class for retarded adults, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) upsets her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by showing
up. In fact, Charlie has forgotten their entire romantic relationship.
Having decided to remove himself from the people who have known
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) and now feel sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) checks himself into a home for
disabled adults. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) last request is for the reader of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) manuscript
to leave fresh flowers on Algernon's grave.
