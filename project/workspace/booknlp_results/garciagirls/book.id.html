enjoyed a fairly sheltered and luxurious childhood in the Dominican
Republic. They often received exciting presents from FAO Schwarz
in the United States. Carla remembers an iron bank representing
Mary ascending to heaven, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave to one of the family's
maids, who was later dismissed for stealing the bank. Yolanda played
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) boy cousin and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) genitals in exchange for
a Human Body doll and modeling clay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) also stole a newborn kitten
from its mother and put it inside a drum that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) played until she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) grew
bored and threw the kitten outside, where it sadly hobbled away.
The mother cat appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in nightmares and haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Sandra
wanted to be an artist but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) irrepressible spirit got her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) in trouble
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) was thrown out of art class. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) later came upon a naked
chained insane sculptor who scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) fell and broke her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>)
arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) artistic vision and settled for being the sculptor's
muse when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) realized he (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) had used her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) face in a representation of
the Virgin Mary. When their father, Carlos, got in trouble with the secret
police for agitating against the military dictatorship, the family
enlisted the help of a CIA operative, Vic, to get them out of the
country. They fled to New York City, where they had trouble adjusting
culturally and materially to the new situation. Laura, the sisters'
mother, came from a wealthy and influential family in the Dominican
Republic and did not like having to become a middle class nobody
in the United States. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) found comfort through supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) daughters'
endeavors, such as Yolanda's poetry and Sofia's defiance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) father's
overprotective nature. Dr. Fanning helped Carlos get a medical fellowship, and
offered to take the family out for a celebratory dinner once they
had settled in the United States. Laura wanted to make a good impression
and pressured the girls to behave themselves and not ask for any
special treats. After Sandra saw Mrs. Fanning kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) father in
the restroom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) insisted that Dr. Fanning buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) a flamenco doll. Carla
had trouble fitting in to American school settings, and was harassed
by abusive and prejudiced schoolboys. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carla</b></font>) also was nearly molested
by a perverted exhibitionist in a car. Yolanda began to write in
English and found a way to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) own voice, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) started
off by imitating Walt Whitman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) father criticized her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) insubordination,
which Yolanda perceived to be intellectual independence. Sofia was
sent to the Dominican Republic as a punishment for using marijuana,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) ended up getting into more trouble by spending time without
a chaperone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) illegitimate cousin, Manuel. In college, Yolanda had trouble relating to men, since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) was turned off by the vocabulary men use to describe sex. Though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) was attracted to a boy, Rudy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) would not sleep with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rudy</b></font>) and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rudy</b></font>) accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) of being frigid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) was hurt by this but later realized that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rudy</b></font>) was just a jerk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) later married a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) loved,
John, though at a certain point they had problems communicating.
Like Rudy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rudy</b></font>) did not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) Dominican cultural heritage,
and could not appreciate the Spanish language. When Yolanda stopped
trusting and loving John, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) could not understand the words he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
used, and only heard <div class="bookquote">``babble, babble.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) had a mental breakdown
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) parents' house, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) could only quote and misquote
bits of things she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) had read and heard throughout her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) spent
time in a mental hospital until she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) recovered. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) sister Sandra
also had a mental breakdown, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) was regressing
through evolution, and would eventually cease to be human. After Sandra is released from the hospital, Sofia planned
to reconcile with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) father during a birthday party. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) broke
tradition, in that the daughters would usually come home for their
father's birthday, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) hosts the party at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) house to show
off her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) German husband and two blond children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) father
had fought when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) of sleeping around during a trip
to Colombia, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) husband, Otto. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) ran away from home
to assert her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) independence, and later married Otto. Though the party
was going well, Sofia was hurt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) father did not express more
affection toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sandra</b></font>) humiliated him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with a seductive kiss in
the ear as part of a party game. Yolanda returned to the Dominican
Republic, possibly for good, to embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) extended family and
cultural roots. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) family thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) was crazy for driving into
the countryside by herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) ignored them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) got lost looking
for fresh guavas, and then got a flat tire. When approached by two
men, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) panicked and pretended not to speak any Spanish. Yolanda
felt more comfortable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) English speaking American identity
than with the Dominican side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yolanda</b></font>) personality.
