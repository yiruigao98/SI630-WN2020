He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) escorts her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) there every week because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has refused to take the bus alone since integration. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) adjusts her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) garish new hat and contemplates returning it to pay the monthly gas bill. While walking through their dilapidated neighborhood, Julian imagines moving to a house in the country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) will one day make money, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) never really will. His (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother encourages him (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) to dream, saying that it will take time to establish himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) continues to chatter, mentioning that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grandfather once owned a plantation with 200 slaves. Embarrassed, Julian comments that the days of slavery are over, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replies that blacks should be free to rise but should do so separately from whites. Both think about the grandfather's house again, and Julian grows envious, despite the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) only saw the house in ruins as a boy. As his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother talks about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) black nurse, Caroline, Julian resolves to sit next to a black person on the bus in reparation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother's prejudices. When they arrive at the bus stop, Julian baits his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother by removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) tie, prompting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to exclaim that he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) looks like a thug. Julian retorts that true culture is in the mind and not reflected by how one acts or looks, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother believes. As they bicker, the bus pulls up and they board. Julian's mother strikes up conversation with other passengers, eventually pointing out with relief that there are only white people on the bus. Another woman joins in, and the subject of the discussion turns to Julian. Julian's mother comments that he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) works as a typewriter salesman but wants to be a writer. Julian withdraws into a mental bubble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) judges his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) opinions, believing that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lives in a distorted fantasy world of false graciousness. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) feels nothing but disdain for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has made sacrifices so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) could have a good education. The bus stops and a well-dressed African American man boards, sits down, and opens a newspaper. Julian imagines striking up conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) just to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother uncomfortable. Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) asks for a light, in spite of the no-smoking signs and the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) doesn't have any cigarettes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) awkwardly returns the matches to the man, who glares at him (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>). Julian dreams up new ways to teach his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother a lesson, imagining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) will ignore her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gets off the bus, which would force her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to worry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) may not pick her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exercise class. Julian retreats deeper into his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) thoughts, daydreaming about bringing a black lawyer or professor home for dinner or about his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother becoming sick and requiring treatment from a black doctor. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) would not want to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother a stroke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) fantasizes about bringing a black woman home and forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Despite these fantasies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) remembers how he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) has failed to connect with the African Americans with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>African</b></font>) has struck up conversations in the past. The bus stops again, and a stern-looking black woman boards with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) young son in tow. Julian senses something familiar about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) doesn't know why. The little boy clambers onto the seat next to Julian's mother, while the black woman squeezes into the seat next to Julian. Julian's mother likes all children regardless of race and smiles at the little boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) then realizes with delight that the black woman seems so familiar because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wears the same ugly hat as his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) hopes the coincidence will teach his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother a lesson. The black woman angrily calls out to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son, Carver, yanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Carver</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side. Julian's mother tries to play peek-a-boo with the little boy, but the black woman ignores her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and chastises her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son instead. Julian and the black woman both pull the signal cord at the same time to get off the bus. Julian realizes with horror that his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother will try to give Carver a nickel as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does with all little children. While they disembark, his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother searches through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) purse but can find only a penny. Despite Julian's warnings, his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother calls after Carver and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Carver</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has a shiny new penny for him (<font color='blue'><b>Carver</b></font>). Carver's mother explodes with rage, shouting <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carver</b></font>) don't take nobody's pennies!''  (<font color='red'><b>Carver mother</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) swings her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) massive purse and knocks Julian's mother down to the ground, then drags Carver away. Julian berates his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother as he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) collects her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) items and pulls her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up. Disoriented, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sways for a moment before stumbling off. Julian follows and lectures her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should learn from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) encounter with the woman on the bus, who represents all African Americans and their distaste for condescending handouts. Reaching out to grab her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) sees a strange expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) to call for Grandpa or her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nurse, Caroline, to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Wresting herself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) grasp, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) crumples to the pavement. Julian rushes to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and finds her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face distorted, one eye rolling around and the other fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) face before finally closing. Julian starts to run for help but quickly returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) mother's side.
