It is late afternoon in the autumn, nearing dusk, in England's coal country. The locomotive pulls into the colliery's loading area, as various miners make their way home. Nearby is a low cottage with a tiled roof and a garden, a sparse apple orchard, and a brook beyond. Elizabeth Bates emerges from the chicken coop, watching the miners walk along the railroad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) turns and calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) son, John, who emerges from the raspberry patch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that it is time to come in. The locomotive her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father is driving appears in the distance. As John makes his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way to the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chides him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) for tearing off the petals of the chrysanthemums and scattering them on the path. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) picks a few of the flowers and, after holding them against her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cheek, sticks a sprig in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) apron. The train comes to a stop near the gate, and Elizabeth brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father tea and bread and butter. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tells Elizabeth that it is time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remarried. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) also informs her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) husband, Walter, had gone on another drinking binge and was heard bragging in the local pub about how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was going to spend. Done with his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) tea, the old man drives off. Elizabeth enters the kitchen, where the table is set and awaiting Walter's return so that the family can have their tea. With no sign of Walter, Elizabeth continues preparing the meal. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) daughter, Annie, enters the room, and Elizabeth mildly scolds her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for being late. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) asks Annie whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) has seen Walter; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) has not. Elizabeth fears that Walter is again at the pub, and at Annie's urging, they start to eat. Annie is transfixed by the slowly dying fire. Eating little, Elizabeth grows increasingly antsy and angry. Elizabeth goes to get coal and drops a few pieces on the fire, which snuffs out almost all the light in the room. John repeatedly complains about the darkness, and Elizabeth lights the overhead lamp, revealing for the first time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) is pregnant. Annie exclaims at the sight of the chrysanthemums in Elizabeth's apron. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) removes them and puts the flowers to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lips, enthralled by their scent. Looking at the clock, Elizabeth realizes that Walter will not get home until he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is again carried in, intoxicated, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) vows not to clean him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) day of work and to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) lying on the floor. The children play quietly, afraid of angering Elizabeth, who sews in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) rocking chair. After a while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sends them to bed, although Annie protests, as Walter has not come home yet. Elizabeth states that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) does appear he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) will be all but unconscious from drinking. Putting the children to bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) angrily and fearfully resumes her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sewing. At eight o'clock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) leaves the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) way to a row of dwellings and enters a passage between two of the houses, asking Mrs. Rigley whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Rigley</b></font>) husband is at home. Mrs. Rigley answers that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has had his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dinner and then gone briefly to the pub and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rigley</b></font>) will go find him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Mrs. Rigley soon returns, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rigley</b></font>) husband in tow. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tells Elizabeth that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last saw Walter at the coal pit, finishing a job. Elizabeth suggests that Walter is simply at another pub, and Mr. Rigley offers to go and find out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) walks her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) home, as Mrs. Rigley runs immediately to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rigley</b></font>) neighbor's house to spread the fresh gossip. After Elizabeth has waited for another forty-five minutes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother-in-law enters the cottage, crying hysterically. Elizabeth asks whether Walter is dead, but all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother-in-law tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) has been in a serious accident. As the mother-in-law laments and defends her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) son's gradual slide into debauchery, a miner arrives to inform the women that Walter has been dead for hours, smothered after a cave-in. Elizabeth's mother-in-law dissolves into tears, and Elizabeth quickly silences her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), afraid that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wailing will wake the children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) moves into the parlor to clear a space on the floor where the body can be laid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spreads cloths on the floor to protect the carpet, takes out a clean shirt to air it, and then waits in the pantry. Shortly, the pit manager and another man arrive with the body on a stretcher. As they bring Walter into the parlor and lay him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) on the floor, one of the men accidentally tips over a vase of chrysanthemums. Elizabeth quickly cleans up the water and broken glass. Annie, who has woken up, calls from upstairs, and Elizabeth rushes up to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). The men try to silence Walter's mother, who is still sobbing loudly. With Annie finally calmed and the men gone, Elizabeth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother-in-law prepare to undress, clean, and lay out the body. Elizabeth embraces the body, trying to make a connection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) husband's still-warm corpse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) and Walter's mother wash the body. Elizabeth presses her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cheek against the body but is repulsed by the dead flesh. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) laments her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) marriage and the hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had in its failure. Walter's mother rouses Elizabeth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) musing. Elizabeth, unable to weep, goes to fetch a shirt. With difficulty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dresses Walter. Covering him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) in a sheet and locking the parlor door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) tidies the kitchen, afraid and ashamed of the harsh realizations she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) has come to as a result of Walter's death.
