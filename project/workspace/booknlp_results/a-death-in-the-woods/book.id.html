All country people have seen a woman like this, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) says, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is usually ignored. The narrator recalls a particular old woman who would walk past his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) house on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way in and out of town, laden with a heavy pack and followed by two or three large, gaunt dogs. The old woman was <div class="bookquote">``nothing special,''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>but thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) have stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) suddenly recalls what happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The woman's name was Grimes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, Jake, and their son in a small house several miles out of town. Both men were tough and violent. The narrator recalls a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) encountered Jake Grimes at Tom Whitehead's livery barn. None of the men there would speak to Grimes, who left after shooting the men a menacing glance. Jake met his (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) future wife at the farm of a German couple, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) was briefly employed and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) labored as an indentured servant. The girl quickly agreed to leave the German, who had sexually assaulted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on several occasions. The German discovered their plan, and the two men engaged in a violent fight before Jake and the girl were able to escape. The narrator wonders how he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) came to know these details, because the events occurred long before he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) was born. The woman and Jake had a son and daughter. The narrator mentions that the daughter died but says nothing else about her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). The Grimes men work little, and the burden of maintaining the livestock falls to the old woman, who is always scheming about how to get everything fed. The woman's husband and son often go off for weeks at a time, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with no money or support. One day during the winter, the old woman goes into town with a few eggs tucked into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old grain bag. A few large farm dogs follow at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heels. At the butcher shop, the butcher, furious that an old, obviously sick woman should be out on such a cold day, tells her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>)'d rather see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband and son starve than get any of the meat he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) is about to give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The old woman doesn't speak, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is mildly surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) reaction. Exhausted and sore, the old woman makes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way through the woods with the pack strapped to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) follows a path to a small clearing, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sits down to rest, eventually closing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes and falling asleep. The four Grimes dogs have picked up a few other farm dogs, and after going off to chase rabbits for a while, they come back to the clearing, excited about something. On a cold, clear night, the narrator says, some old instinct might take hold of these kinds of dogs. The dogs run silently around the clearing in what the narrator calls <div class="bookquote">``a kind of death ceremony.''  (<font color='red'><b>the narrator</b></font>)</div>Each dog takes turns nosing up against the old woman as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dies. The narrator says that, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wasn't present, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) knows what happened because years later, as an adult, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) once found himself in the woods on a winter night and saw a pack of dogs act the same way. The old woman dies quietly, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does, the dogs stop running. They gather around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and drag the large pack of meat and soup bones away. The dogs do not touch the old woman's body. When a rabbit hunter finds her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a day or two later, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) frozen body is so slight and narrow that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks like a young girl. The narrator is following along on his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) brother's newspaper-delivery route when the hunter comes to town with his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) news. The hunter and the town marshal lead a group of townsmen out to the woods to see the body. When the group arrives at the clearing, the narrator notes that the woman does not, in fact, look old. Neither he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) nor his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) brother has ever seen a woman's naked body before. In the snow, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks white and lovely. When the party arrives back in town, the men take the body to the undertaker's and shut the door. The boys go home and the brother tells the family what happened, but the narrator keeps silent and goes to bed early. Jake Grimes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) son are found and questioned, and though they could not be implicated in the old woman's death, the townspeople's disapproval drives them out of town. The narrator only remembers the image of the woman's body in the clearing. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) says that somehow that scene has become <div class="bookquote">``the foundation for the real story I am now trying to tell.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>In a disconnected fashion, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) describes how, as a young man, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) worked for a German farmer whose hired girl feared him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>). Later, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) had a strange encounter with a pack of dogs in a forest on a winter night. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) recounts how, as a child one summer day, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) and a friend went to the old Grimes house, which had been abandoned except for a pair of tall, gaunt dogs. The narrator compares the woman's story to a piece of faint music, heard from far away, which needs to be listened to slowly before it is truly understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) claims that he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) brother were too young at the time to fully understand the point of the story. <div class="bookquote">``A thing so complete has its own beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) says. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) ends by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) won't emphasize the point: he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)'s only trying to explain why, so many years later, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) is telling the story over again.
