He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dreams of being the fastest boy in the fifth grade when school starts up in the fall, feeling that this will for once give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a chance to stand in the spotlight among his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) five sisters, and might win him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the attention of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) preoccupied father. Jess is quite insecure in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) identity. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) loves to paint and draw, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows very well that this labels him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``sissy''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>in the eyes of most of the world, particularly his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father. In addition, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) family is stretched so tight by poverty that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has little chance to really explore his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own identity during this crucial period of adolescence. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has therefore built up the importance of winning in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind, feeling that here, at least, is something that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is good at which won't win him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) an undesired label of <div class="bookquote">``sissy''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``girl''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>in the eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father or schoolmates, and which will allow him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to shine in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own right. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) practices each morning, always dreaming of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) upcoming victory. However, when the races come around at recess, a new girl, Leslie Burke, who just moved next door to Jess, boldly crosses to the boys' side of the playground and beats everyone. A rather unpromising beginning, but Jess and Leslie become fast friends. They build a secret fantasyland across the creek in the woods, called Terabithia, where they play all the time. There they forget the rest of the world, such as the kids at school or Jess's less-than-satisfactory family. The time they spend in Terabithia, in fact, seems to strengthen them for these trials of everyday life: it is there that they map out a plan of revenge on the school bully when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) steals May Belle's Twinkies, and it is there that they discuss Jess's feelings of insecurity when Leslie begins to draw closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leslie</b></font>) father. Leslie also introduces Jess to the world of imagination and creativity, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the stories of such classics of literature as Moby Dick and Hamlet. All this also strengthens Jess's artistic talent and ability, as Leslie supports his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) ambition and, through the stories she (<font color='blue'><b>Leslie</b></font>) tells, provides him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) with great subject matter. But much of the time they play wonderful games of their own invention--defeating intruders on Terabithian territory, praying to the Spirits of the Grove to end a long spell of rain, and numerous other fantasies. However, Jess and Leslie's friendship, though centered in Terabithia, is not limited to Terabithia. They see each other at school, where they take a good deal of ribbing for their cross-gender friendship, but by now that sort of teasing has lost the power to hurt Jess, and Leslie has never been particularly bothered by what others think. At home, they celebrate holidays together, such as Christmas, when Jess gives Leslie a puppy and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) an expensive art set to develop his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) artistic talent, and Easter, when Leslie goes to church for the first time with Jess. Leslie is impressed by the beauty of the story of Christ. Jess and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) little sister May Belle, cowed by negative and unforgiving religious training, are convinced that nonbelievers such as Leslie are doomed to hell, and find the whole experience disturbing. Nevertheless, Jess and Leslie remain the best of friends, and Jess finds a purpose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) life through Leslie's company that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)'s never had before. One day the music teacher at school, Miss Edmunds, whom Jess has long had a crush on, invites him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) to spend a day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) touring the art galleries in Washington. This trip does much to expand his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) mind and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) is special, a feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) has previously only had in Leslie's company. Jess has a perfect day, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) gets home he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) is told that Leslie drowned in the creek that morning trying to swing into Terabithia on the rope that they used for that purpose. Jess is completely devastated and goes through the stages of grief--denial, anger, fear, and sorrow--all incredibly painful to suffer and, indeed, to read about. Initially, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) does not see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) is to go on initially. Leslie has raised him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) to new heights as the king of Terabithia, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) feels that without her (<font color='blue'><b>Leslie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) has no choice but to revert to the old Jess, plagued by fear and insecurity. However, eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) can only keep Leslie's memory, and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own newfound sense of self, alive by continuing the fantasy of Terabithia. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) brings his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) little sister May Belle there and makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) its new queen, assuring that a part of Leslie will live on as well.
