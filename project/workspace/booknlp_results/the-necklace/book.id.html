She (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) was married off to a lowly clerk in the Ministry of Education, who can afford to provide her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) only with a modest though not uncomfortable lifestyle. Mathilde feels the burden of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) poverty intensely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) regrets her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) lot in life and spends endless hours imagining a more extravagant existence. While her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) husband expresses his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pleasure at the small, modest supper she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) has prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) dreams of an elaborate feast served on fancy china and eaten in the company of wealthy friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) possesses no fancy jewels or clothing, yet these are the only things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) lives for. Without them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) feels she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) is not desirable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) has one wealthy friend, Madame Forestier, but refuses to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) because of the heartbreak it brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>). One night, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) husband returns home proudly bearing an invitation to a formal party hosted by the Ministry of Education. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hopes that Mathilde will be thrilled with the chance to attend an event of this sort, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) is instantly angry and begins to cry. Through her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) has nothing to wear and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ought to give the invitation to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) friends whose wife can afford better clothing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband is upset by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reaction and asks how much a suitable dress would cost. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thinks about it carefully and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that 400 francs would be enough. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband quietly balks at the sum but agrees that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may have the money. As the day of the party approaches, Mathilde starts to behave oddly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) confesses that the reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) behavior is her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) lack of jewels. Monsieur Loisel suggests that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) wear flowers, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) refuses. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) implores her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) to visit Madame Forestier and borrow something from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>). Madame Forestier agrees to lend Mathilde her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) jewels, and Mathilde selects a diamond necklace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) is overcome with gratitude at Madame Forestier's generosity. At the party, Mathilde is the most beautiful woman in attendance, and everyone notices her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) is intoxicated by the attention and has an overwhelming sense of self-satisfaction. At 4 a.m., she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) finally looks for Monsieur Loisel, who has been dozing for hours in a deserted room. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cloaks her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) bare shoulders in a wrap and cautions her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) to wait inside, away from the cold night air, while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fetches a cab. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) is ashamed at the shabbiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) wrap and follows Monsieur Loisel outside. They walk for a while before hailing a cab. When they finally return home, Mathilde is saddened that the night has ended. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) removes her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) wrap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) discovers that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) necklace is no longer around her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) neck. In a panic, Monsieur Loisel goes outside and retraces their steps. Terrified, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) sits and waits for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) returns home much later in an even greater panic--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has not found the necklace. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) instructs her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) to write to Madame Forestier and say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) has broken the clasp of the necklace and is getting it mended. They continue to look for the necklace. After a week, Monsieur Loisel says they have to see about replacing it. They visit many jewelers, searching for a similar necklace, and finally find one. It costs 40,000 francs, although the jeweler says he (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) will give it to them for 36,000. The Loisels spend a week scraping up money from all kinds of sources, mortgaging the rest of their existence. After three days, Monsieur Loisel purchases the necklace. When Mathilde returns the necklace, in its case, to Madame Forestier, Madame Forestier is annoyed at how long it has taken to get it back but does not open the case to inspect it. Mathilde is relieved. The Loisels began to live a life of crippling poverty. They dismiss their servant and move into an even smaller apartment. Monsieur Loisel works three jobs, and Mathilde spends all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) time doing the heavy housework. This misery lasts ten years, but at the end they have repaid their financial debts. Mathilde's extraordinary beauty is now gone: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) looks just likes the other women of poor households. They are both tired and irrevocably damaged from these years of hardship. One Sunday, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) is out for a walk, Mathilde spots Madame Forestier. Feeling emotional, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) approaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) and offers greetings. Madame Forestier does not recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>), and when Mathilde identifies herself, Madame Forestier cannot help but exclaim that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) looks different. Mathilde says that the change was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) account and explains to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) the long saga of losing the necklace, replacing it, and working for ten years to repay the debts. At the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) story, Madame Forestier clasps her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) hands and tells Mathilde the original necklace was just costume jewelry and not worth anything.
