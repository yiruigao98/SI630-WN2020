the brief appearance of a trio of witches and then moves to a military
camp, where the Scottish King Duncan hears the news that his (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) generals, Macbeth
and Banquo, have defeated two separate invading armies--one from
Ireland, led by the rebel Macdonwald, and one from Norway. Following
their pitched battle with these enemy forces, Macbeth and Banquo
encounter the witches as they cross a moor. The witches prophesy
that Macbeth will be made thane -LRB-a rank of Scottish nobility-RRB- of
Cawdor and eventually King of Scotland. They also prophesy that
Macbeth's companion, Banquo, will beget a line of Scottish kings,
although Banquo will never be king himself. The witches vanish,
and Macbeth and Banquo treat their prophecies skeptically until
some of King Duncan's men come to thank the two generals for their
victories in battle and to tell Macbeth that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) has indeed been
named thane of Cawdor. The previous thane betrayed Scotland by fighting
for the Norwegians and Duncan has condemned him (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) to death. Macbeth
is intrigued by the possibility that the remainder of the witches'
prophecy--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) will be crowned king--might be true, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) is uncertain
what to expect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) visits with King Duncan, and they plan to dine
together at Inverness, Macbeth's castle, that night. Macbeth writes
ahead to his (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) wife, Lady Macbeth, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) all that has happened. Lady Macbeth suffers none of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) husband's uncertainty.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) desires the kingship for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and wants him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to murder Duncan
in order to obtain it. When Macbeth arrives at Inverness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) overrides all
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) husband's objections and persuades him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to kill the king that
very night. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and Lady Macbeth plan to get Duncan's two chamberlains
drunk so they will black out; the next morning they will blame the
murder on the chamberlains, who will be defenseless, as they will
remember nothing. While Duncan is asleep, Macbeth stabs him (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>), despite
his (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) doubts and a number of supernatural portents, including a vision
of a bloody dagger. When Duncan's death is discovered the next morning,
Macbeth kills the chamberlains--ostensibly out of rage at their crime--and
easily assumes the kingship. Duncan's sons Malcolm and Donalbain
flee to England and Ireland, respectively, fearing that whoever
killed Duncan desires their demise as well. Fearful of the witches' prophecy that Banquo's heirs will
seize the throne, Macbeth hires a group of murderers to kill Banquo
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) son Fleance. They ambush Banquo on his (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) way to a royal feast,
but they fail to kill Fleance, who escapes into the night. Macbeth becomes
furious: as long as Fleance is alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) fears that his (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) power remains
insecure. At the feast that night, Banquo's ghost visits Macbeth.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) sees the ghost, Macbeth raves fearfully, startling his (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) guests,
who include most of the great Scottish nobility. Lady Macbeth tries
to neutralize the damage, but Macbeth's kingship incites increasing
resistance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) nobles and subjects. Frightened, Macbeth goes
to visit the witches in their cavern. There, they show him (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) a sequence
of demons and spirits who present him (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) with further prophecies: he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>)
must beware of Macduff, a Scottish nobleman who opposed Macbeth's
accession to the throne; he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) is incapable of being harmed
by any man born of woman; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) will be safe until Birnam Wood
comes to Dunsinane Castle. Macbeth is relieved and feels secure, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) knows that all men are born of women and that forests cannot
move. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) learns that Macduff has fled to England
to join Malcolm, Macbeth orders that Macduff's castle be seized
and, most cruelly, that Lady Macduff and her (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) children be murdered. When news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) family's execution reaches
Macduff in England, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) is stricken with grief and vows revenge.
Prince Malcolm, Duncan's son, has succeeded in raising an army in
England, and Macduff joins him (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) rides to Scotland to challenge
Macbeth's forces. The invasion has the support of the Scottish nobles, who
are appalled and frightened by Macbeth's tyrannical and murderous
behavior. Lady Macbeth, meanwhile, becomes plagued with fits of
sleepwalking in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) bemoans what she (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) believes to be bloodstains
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) hands. Before Macbeth's opponents arrive, Macbeth receives
news that she (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) has killed herself, causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) to sink into a deep
and pessimistic despair. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) awaits the English and
fortifies Dunsinane, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) seems to have withdrawn in order
to defend himself, certain that the witches' prophecies guarantee
his (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) invincibility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>) is struck numb with fear, however, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>)
learns that the English army is advancing on Dunsinane shielded
with boughs cut from Birnam Wood. Birnam Wood is indeed coming to
Dunsinane, fulfilling half of the witches' prophecy. In the battle, Macbeth hews violently, but the English
forces gradually overwhelm his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) army and castle. On the battlefield,
Macbeth encounters the vengeful Macduff, who declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) was
not <div class="bookquote">``of woman born''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but was instead <div class="bookquote">``untimely ripped''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) mother's
womb -LRB-what we now call birth by cesarean section-RRB-. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) realizes
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) is doomed, Macbeth continues to fight until Macduff kills
and beheads him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>). Malcolm, now the King of Scotland, declares his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)
benevolent intentions for the country and invites all to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)
crowned at Scone.
