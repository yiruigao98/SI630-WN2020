In April, thousands of rats stagger into the open and die. When a mild hysteria grips the population, the newspapers begin clamoring for action. The authorities finally arrange for the daily collection and cremation of the rats. Soon thereafter, M. Michel, the concierge for the building where Dr. Rieux works, dies after falling ill with a strange fever. When a cluster of similar cases appears, Dr. Rieux's colleague, Castel, becomes certain that the illness is the bubonic plague. He (<font color='blue'><b>colleague</b></font>) and Dr. Rieux are forced to confront the indifference and denial of the authorities and other doctors in their attempts to urge quick, decisive action. Only after it becomes impossible to deny that a serious epidemic is ravaging Oran, do the authorities enact strict sanitation measures, placing the whole city under quarantine. The public reacts to their sudden imprisonment with intense longing for absent loved ones. They indulge in selfish personal distress, convinced that their pain is unique in comparison to common suffering. Father Paneloux delivers a stern sermon, declaring that the plague is God's punishment for Oran's sins. Raymond Rambert endeavors to escape Oran to rejoin his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) wife in Paris, but the city's bureaucrats refuse to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) tries to escape by illegal means with the help of Cottard's criminal associates. Meanwhile, Rieux, Tarrou, and Grand doggedly battle the death and suffering wrought by the plague. Rambert finalizes his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) escape plan, but, after Tarrou tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) that Rieux is likewise separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) wife, Rambert is ashamed to flee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) chooses to stay behind and help fight the epidemic. Cottard committed a crime -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) does not name-RRB- in the past, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) has lived in constant fear of arrest and punishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) greets the plague epidemic with open arms because he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) no longer feels alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) fearful suffering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) accumulates a great deal of wealth as a smuggler during the epidemic. After the term of exile lasts several months, many of Oran's citizens lose their selfish obsession with personal suffering. They come to recognize the plague as a collective disaster that is everyone's concern. They confront their social responsibility and join the anti-plague efforts. When M. Othon's small son suffers a prolonged, excruciating death from the plague, Dr. Rieux shouts at Paneloux that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was an innocent victim. Paneloux, deeply shaken by the boy's death, delivers a second sermon that modifies the first. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) declares that the inexplicable deaths of innocents force the Christian to choose between believing everything and believing nothing about God. When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) falls ill, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) refuses to consult a doctor, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fate entirely in the hands of divine Providence. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dies clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) crucifix, but the symptoms of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) illness do not match those of the plague. Dr. Rieux records him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as a <div class="bookquote">``doubtful case.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>When the epidemic ends, Cottard cannot cope. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) begins randomly firing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gun into the street until he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is captured by the police. Grand, having recovered from a bout of plague, vows to make a fresh start in life. Tarrou dies just as the epidemic is waning, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) battles with all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) strength for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) life, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) helped Rieux battle for the lives of others. Rambert's wife joins him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in Oran after the city gates are finally opened, but Dr. Rieux's own wife dies of a prolonged illness before she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband can be reunited. The public quickly returns to its old routine, but Rieux knows that the battle against the plague is never over because the bacillus microbe can lie dormant for years. The Plague is his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chronicle of the scene of human suffering that all too many people are willing to forget.
