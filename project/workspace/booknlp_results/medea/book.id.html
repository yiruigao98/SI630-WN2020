Jason has abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) wife, Medea, along with their two children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) hopes to advance his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters. Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) curses her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) own existence, as well as that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) two children. Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) must leave, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) plans to complete her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) quest for <div class="bookquote">``justice'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--at this stage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) grievances so publicly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) has endangered her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) life and that of their children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) claims that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) spineless, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) refuses to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) token offers of help. Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) home city in exchange for her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) own children; the pain their loss will cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) does not outweigh the satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) will feel in making Jason suffer. For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) pretends to sympathize with Jason -LRB-bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) confidence-RRB- and offers his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) wife <div class="bookquote">``gifts,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) side by dramatically embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and absorbing the poison himself. A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) lot; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) hope of advancing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy.
