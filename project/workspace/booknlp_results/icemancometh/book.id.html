The majority of the customers sleep slumped over their tables. Rocky, the night bartender, sneaks Larry Slade, a former Syndicalist-Anarchist, a drink of whiskey. Larry notes how their group has a <div class="bookquote">``touching credulity''  (<font color='red'><b>Larry</b></font>)</div>concerning tomorrows: the pipe dream gives life to the <div class="bookquote">``misbegotten lot.''  (<font color='red'><b>Larry</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>), on the other hand, has buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) pipe dreams, retiring to the <div class="bookquote">``grandstand of philosophical detachment''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>to await his (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) death. Parritt, a young ex-Anarchist, enters. His (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) cohorts were recently arrested for a bombing on the Coast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) has come to Larry for help, since years ago, Larry had an affair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) mother. Willie tells of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) days at Harvard Law School and the ruin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) industrialist father. A chorus of each guest's fond reminiscences and pipe dreams follows. Hope has not left the bar for twenty years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) is sure, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) will venture out tomorrow. Wetjoen and Lewis jocularly recall their wartime days and imagine their happy return home. Jimmy joins them and pledges to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) old newspaper job back tomorrow. Joe remembers his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) gambling house and dreams of a new venture. Mosher announces his (<font color='blue'><b>Mosher</b></font>) plans to return to the circus. McGloin speaks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mosher</b></font>) imminent reinstatement with the police. Margie and Pearl, Rocky's <div class="bookquote">``tarts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rocky</b></font>)</div>then appear. They chat about their friends Cora, another tart, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margie</b></font>) pimp Chuck, who have long nursed a pipe dream about getting married and buying a farm. Hickey, a salesman, makes a grand entrance and is sober. The residents receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) warily. In Act II, the residents of the bar are irritated and apprehensive, and they are getting ready for a celebration. Hickey is certain that Larry is the only one who can help Parritt. Parritt needs punishment so he (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) can forgive himself. Hickey begins the festivities, and the crowd half-heartedly follows. Hope enters and rails at the crowd, and Hickey begins preaching anew. Larry tauntingly asks whether Hickey's wife finally end up with the iceman. Hickey announces simply that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) wife Evelyn is dead. Act III opens in the barroom on the morning of Hope's birthday. Larry defiantly insists that Hickey has nothing on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>). Parritt admits that lied earlier about his (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) patriotism; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) ratted on the group for some money to blow on a whore. Larry notes he (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) has not explained Evelyn's death--it would little surprise if she (<font color='blue'><b>Evelyn</b></font>) committed suicide. The members of the party gradually appear, weakly putting up fronts of self-assurance and almost coming to blows when the others deride their intentions. Hickey appears and prods the condemned men out of the saloon. Hope returns and pleadingly insists that an automobile almost ran him (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) over. Bitterly Larry condemns Hickey: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) has brought them the peace of death. For the first time Hickey loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) temper and insists that the shock is only temporary--peace will follow. Hickey quietly informs him (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Evelyn</b></font>) did not kill herself: she (<font color='blue'><b>Evelyn</b></font>) was murdered. Act IV begins half past one the next morning in the saloon. The group has returned and sit like wax figures benumbing themselves to the world. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) speaks, Hickey appears at the doorway and denounces Larry angrily. The crowd shrinks away. Hickey begs his (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) friends not to persist in their depression if they are trying to spite him (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>). They have killed their tomorrows and should rejoice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) was living in hell himself until he (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) found a way to free Evelyn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Evelyn</b></font>) pipe dream of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) possible reformation. Two policemen, Moran and Lieb enter from the rear; Hickey has called to turn himself in. Suddenly Hickey explodes, insisting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) must tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) story, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) confesses that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) wife in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sleep to put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own misery. A relieved Parritt makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) own confession and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) betrayed Mother because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). Hickey earnestly begs for the electric chair as the cops take him (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) out--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) has not got a pipe dream left and wants to die. With Hickey gone, Parritt begins begging Larry anew for help. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) too thought of vengeance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hickey</b></font>) treason. Larry commands him (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) suicide. Parritt thanks him (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) with simple gratitude. Jubilantly Hope starts the festivities anew. Hesistantly, the group comes to revive their pipe dreams. A crunching thud is heard, and Larry hides his (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) hands.
