However, his (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) world is thrown upside down by the sensational arrival of May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Recently returned to America after separating from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) husband, a philandering Polish count, Countess Olenska shocks the staid New York aristocracy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Olenska</b></font>) revealing clothes, carefree manners, and rumors of adultery. Because the Countess's family, headed by the powerful Mrs. Manson Mingott, have chosen to reintroduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) into good society, Archer and May feel it necessary to befriend her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>). As Archer comes to better know the Countess, he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) begins to appreciate her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) unconventional views on New York society. Meanwhile, Archer becomes increasingly disillusioned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) new fiance√©, May. He (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) begins to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) as the manufactured product of her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) class: polite, innocent, and utterly devoid of personal opinion and sense of self. The Countess Olenska soon announces her (<font color='blue'><b>Olenska</b></font>) intention of divorcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Olenska</b></font>) husband. While Archer supports her (<font color='blue'><b>Olenska</b></font>) desire for freedom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) feels compelled to act on behalf of the Mingott family and persuade Ellen to remain married. At a friend's cottage near Hudson, Archer realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) is in love with Ellen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) abruptly leaves the next day for Florida, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) is reunited with May and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) parents, who are there on vacation. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) presses May to shorten their engagement. May becomes suspicious and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) if his (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) hurry to get married is prompted by the fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) is marrying the wrong person. Archer reassures May that he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>). Back in New York, Archer calls on Ellen, and Archer admits that he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>). Just then, a telegram arrives from May, announcing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) parents have pushed forward the wedding date. After their wedding and honeymoon in Europe, Archer and May settle down to married life in New York. Over time, Archer's memory of Ellen fades to a wistful image. But on vacation in Newport, he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) is reunited with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>), and Ellen promises not to return to Europe as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) and Newland do not act upon their love for each other. Back in New York, Archer learns that Count Olenski wants his (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) wife to return to him (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) and that Ellen has refused. After the stroke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother, Ellen returns to New York to care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) and Archer agree to consummate their affair. But suddenly, Ellen announces her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) intention to return to Europe. May throws a farewell party for Ellen, and after the guests leave, May announces to Archer that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) is pregnant and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) told Ellen her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) news two weeks earlier. Twenty-five years pass. In that time, the Archers have had three children and May has died from pneumonia. Now Archer's son convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) to travel to France. There, they arrange to visit the Countess Olenska at her (<font color='blue'><b>Olenska</b></font>) Paris apartment. However, at the last minute Archer sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) son alone to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Olenska</b></font>), content instead to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) memories of the past.
