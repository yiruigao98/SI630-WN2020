set around the 1950s and is narrated by a
young man named Holden Caulfield. Holden is not specific about his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>)
location while he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>)'s telling the story, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) makes it clear that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is undergoing treatment in a mental hospital or sanatorium. The
events he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) narrates take place in the few days between the end of
the fall school term and Christmas, when Holden is sixteen years
old. Holden's story begins on the Saturday following
the end of classes at the Pencey prep school in Agerstown, Pennsylvania.
Pencey is Holden's fourth school; he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) has already failed out of three
others. At Pencey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) has failed four out of five of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) classes
and has received notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is being expelled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is not
scheduled to return home to Manhattan until Wednesday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) visits
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) elderly history teacher, Spencer, to say goodbye, but when Spencer
tries to reprimand him (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) poor academic performance, Holden
becomes annoyed. Back in the dormitory, Holden is further irritated
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) unhygienic neighbor, Ackley, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) own roommate, Stradlater.
Stradlater spends the evening on a date with Jane Gallagher, a girl
whom Holden used to date and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) still admires. During the course
of the evening, Holden grows increasingly nervous about Stradlater's
taking Jane out, and when Stradlater returns, Holden questions him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>)
insistently about whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) tried to have sex with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). Stradlater
teases Holden, who flies into a rage and attacks Stradlater. Stradlater
pins Holden down and bloodies his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) nose. Holden decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>)'s
had enough of Pencey and will go to Manhattan three days early,
stay in a hotel, and not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) parents that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is back. On the train to New York, Holden meets the mother
of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) fellow Pencey students. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) thinks this student
is a complete <div class="bookquote">``bastard,''  (<font color='red'><b>this student</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) tells the woman made-up stories about
how shy her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son is and how well respected he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is at school. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) arrives at Penn Station, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) goes into a phone booth and considers
calling several people, but for various reasons he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) decides against
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) gets in a cab and asks the cab driver where the ducks in
Central Park go when the lagoon freezes, but his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) question annoys
the driver. Holden has the cab driver take him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) to the Edmont Hotel, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) checks himself in. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) room at the Edmont, Holden can see into the rooms
of some of the guests in the opposite wing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) observes a man putting on
silk stockings, high heels, a bra, a corset, and an evening gown. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>)
also sees a man and a woman in another room taking turns spitting
mouthfuls of their drinks into each other's faces and laughing hysterically.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) interprets the couple's behavior as a form of sexual play and
is both upset and aroused by it. After smoking a couple of cigarettes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) calls Faith Cavendish, a woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) has never met but whose number
he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) got from an acquaintance at Princeton. Holden thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) remembers
hearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) used to be a stripper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) can persuade
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to have sex with him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) calls her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is at first
annoyed to be called at such a late hour by a complete stranger,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eventually suggests that they meet the next day. Holden doesn't
want to wait that long and winds up hanging up without arranging
a meeting. Holden goes downstairs to the Lavender Room and sits at
a table, but the waiter realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>)'s a minor and refuses to serve
him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) flirts with three women in their thirties, who seem like
they're from out of town and are mostly interested in catching a
glimpse of a celebrity. Nevertheless, Holden dances with them and
feels that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``half in love''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with the blonde one after seeing
how well she (<font color='blue'><b>thirties</b></font>) dances. After making some wisecracks about his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) age,
they leave, letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) pay their entire tab. As Holden goes out to the lobby, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) starts to
think about Jane Gallagher and, in a flashback, recounts how he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>)
got to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Gallagher</b></font>). They met while spending a summer vacation in Maine,
played golf and checkers, and held hands at the movies. One afternoon,
during a game of checkers, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gallagher</b></font>) stepfather came onto the porch where
they were playing, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>stepfather</b></font>) left Jane began to cry. Holden had
moved to sit beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) face, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
wouldn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) on the mouth. That was the closest they
came to <div class="bookquote">``necking.''  (<font color='red'><b>Holden</b></font>)</div>Holden leaves the Edmont and takes a cab to Ernie's jazz
club in Greenwich Village. Again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) asks the cab driver where the
ducks in Central Park go in the winter, and this cabbie is even
more irritable than the first one. Holden sits alone at a table
in Ernie's and observes the other patrons with distaste. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) runs
into Lillian Simmons, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) older brother's former girlfriends,
who invites him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) to sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) date. Holden says he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) has
to meet someone, leaves, and walks back to the Edmont. Maurice, the elevator operator at the Edmont, offers to
send a prostitute to Holden's room for five dollars, and Holden
agrees. Ayoung woman, identifying herself as <div class="bookquote">``Sunny,''  (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div>arrives at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>)door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sunny</b></font>) pulls off her (<font color='blue'><b>Sunny</b></font>) dress, but Holden starts to feel <div class="bookquote">``peculiar''
 (<font color='red'><b>Holden</b></font>)</div>and tries to make conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sunny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) claims that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) recently
underwent a spinal operation and isn't sufficiently recovered to
have sex with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sunny</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) offers to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Sunny</b></font>) anyway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sunny</b></font>) sits on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) lap and talks dirty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) insists on paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Sunny</b></font>) five
dollars and showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sunny</b></font>) the door. Sunny returns with Maurice, who
demands another five dollars from Holden. When Holden refuses to
pay, Maurice punches him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) in the stomach and leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) on the floor, while
Sunny takes five dollars from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) wallet. Holden goes to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) wakes up at ten o'clock on Sunday and calls Sally Hayes,
an attractive girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) has dated in the past. They arrange to
meet for a matinee showing of a Broadway play. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) eats breakfast
at a sandwich bar, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) converses with two nuns about Romeo
and Juliet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) gives the nuns ten dollars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) tries to telephone
Jane Gallagher, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gallagher</b></font>) mother answers the phone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) hangs up.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) takes a cab to Central Park to look for his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) younger sister, Phoebe, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) isn't there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) helps one of Phoebe's schoolmates tighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) skate,
and the girl tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) that Phoebe might be in the Museum of Natural
History. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) knows that Phoebe's class wouldn't be at the
museum on a Sunday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) goes there anyway, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) gets there
he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) decides not to go in and instead takes a cab to the Biltmore Hotel
to meet Sally. Holden and Sally go to the play, and Holden is annoyed
that Sally talks with a boy she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) knows from Andover afterward. At
Sally's suggestion, they go to Radio City to ice skate. They both
skate poorly and decide to get a table instead. Holden tries to
explain to Sally why he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is unhappy at school, and actually urges
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) to run away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) to Massachusetts or Vermont and live in
a cabin. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) refuses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``pain in the ass''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
laughs at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) reacts angrily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) refuses to listen to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) apologies and leaves. Holden calls Jane again, but there is no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) calls
Carl Luce, a young man who had been Holden's student advisor at
the Whooton School and who is now a student at Columbia University. Luce
arranges to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Luce</b></font>) for a drink after dinner, and Holden goes to
a movie at Radio City to kill time. Holden and Luce meet at the Wicker
Bar in the Seton Hotel. At Whooton, Luce had spoken frankly with
some of the boys about sex, and Holden tries to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) into a
conversation about it once more. Luce grows irritated by Holden's
juvenile remarks about homosexuals and about Luce's Chinese girlfriend,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) makes an excuse to leave early. Holden continues to drink
Scotch and listen to the pianist and singer. Quite drunk, Holden telephones Sally Hayes and babbles
about their Christmas Eve plans. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) goes to the lagoon in Central Park,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) used to watch the ducks as a child. It takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) a long time
to find it, and by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) does, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is freezing cold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) then decides
to sneak into his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) own apartment building and wake his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) sister, Phoebe.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is forced to admit to Phoebe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) was kicked out of school,
which makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) mad at him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) tries to explain why he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) hates
school, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) accuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) of not liking anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>)
fantasy of being <div class="bookquote">``the catcher in the rye,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>a person who catches
little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff. Phoebe tells
him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) has misremembered the poem that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) took the image from:
Robert Burns's poem says <div class="bookquote">``if a body meet a body, coming through
the rye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert Burns</b></font>)</div>not <div class="bookquote">``catch a body.''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert Burns</b></font>)</div>Holden calls his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) former English teacher, Mr. Antolini,
who tells Holden he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) can come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) apartment. Mr. Antolini asks
Holden about his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) expulsion and tries to counsel him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) future. Holden
can't hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) sleepiness, and Mr. Antolini puts him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) to bed on the
couch. Holden awakens to find Mr. Antolini stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) forehead.
Thinking that Mr. Antolini is making a homosexual overture, Holden
hastily excuses himself and leaves, sleeping for a few hours on
a bench at Grand Central Station. Holden goes to Phoebe's school and sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) a note saying
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is leaving home for good and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) should meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) at
lunchtime at the museum. When Phoebe arrives, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) is carrying a
suitcase full of clothes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) asks Holden to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) refuses angrily, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) cries and then refuses to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>).
Knowing she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) will follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) walks to the zoo, and then takes
her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) across the park to a carousel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) buys her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) a ticket and watches
her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) ride it. It starts to rain heavily, but Holden is so happy watching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) sister ride the carousel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is close to tears. Holden ends his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) narrative here, telling the reader
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) is not going to tell the story of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) went home and got
<div class="bookquote">``sick.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) plans to go to a new school in the fall and is cautiously
optimistic about his (<font color='blue'><b>Holden</b></font>) future.
