During this time, Orlando ages only thirty-six years, and changes gender from a man to a woman. This fantastic story opens with the protagonist, Orlando, a young noble boy, pretending to chop off the heads of Moors, just like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father and grandfather have done. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is too young to fight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) longs to go on adventures around the world like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) family. Young Orlando goes out into the woods to write poetry and he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) falls asleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) is awakened by trumpets sounding that the Queen Elizabeth has arrived. Orlando runs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) house to get ready. When the Queen sees him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) is impressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) youth and innocence. Two years later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sends for him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) court. There, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) Steward, Treasurer, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) lover, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Treasurer</b></font>) all the wealth and status he (<font color='blue'><b>Treasurer</b></font>) could want. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sees Orlando kissing a young girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) becomes furious and smashes her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) mirror with a sword. For a while, Orlando takes to spending time with people of a <div class="bookquote">``low kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Treasurer</b></font>) frequents pubs and has his (<font color='blue'><b>Treasurer</b></font>) way with many young women. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Treasurer</b></font>) grows tired of this lifestyle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Treasurer</b></font>) heads back to the Court, this time under King James I -LRB-Queen Elizabeth has died-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) dates many pretty and wealthy women, and becomes engaged to Euphrosyne, a woman of incredibly high birth and connections. This is the winter of the Great Frost and King James has turned the frozen river into a carnival scene. One night on the river, Orlando sees a figure skate past him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is not sure whether it is a man or a woman, but he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is incredibly attracted to it. It turns out to be the Russian princess, Sasha. Because Orlando speaks fluent French, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) is the only one who can converse with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>). They grow very close, become lovers, and plan to run away together. One day, Orlando sees her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) on the knee of a Russian sailor and he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) grows very angry. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) assures him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) that nothing at all is going on. They plan to leave London together that night, but Orlando waits for Sasha and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) never arrives. Orlando rides to the river to find that the frost has broken; hundreds of people are stranded on icebergs and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) watches as the Russian ship drifts away. Heartbroken, Orlando closes himself up inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) house with 365 rooms and fifty-two staircases. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) will concentrate all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) efforts on writing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) invites Nick Greene, a famous poet, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) house, and although Nick is entertaining, their difference in class is clearly a great barrier between them. When Nick returns home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) writes a parody of Orlando, a rich nobleman closed up inside his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) house. Orlando is once again heartbroken and he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) burns all his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) poems and dramas save one, a poem entitled <div class="bookquote">``The Oak Tree.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Orlando decides to refurnish every room in his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) home; after this is done, he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) invites all the neighbors in, earning their respect. One afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) sees a figure on horseback in his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) courtyard. It is an extremely tall woman, the Archduchess Harriet of Romania. Orlando is repulsed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) advances toward him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) decides to leave England immediately. King Charles II sends Orlando to Constantinople as an ambassador. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) does such a good job that King Charles makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a duke. That night, witnesses see Orlando lowering a rope down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) balcony, pulling up a woman, and embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passionately. The next morning, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) servants find Orlando alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) room, in a trance, unable to be awakened. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) desk they find a marriage certificate between Orlando and Rosina Pepita, a Spanish dancer. An insurrection occurs in Turkey and many foreigners are killed. Robbers break into Orlando's room, but since he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is in a trance, they think he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is already dead. After seven days, Orlando awakens from the trance a woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not surprised, and it does not take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long to get used to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) new body. Orlando rides away with Rustum, an old gypsy and joins Rustum's tribe in the mountains of Turkey. There, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feels at one with nature, but the gypsies mistrust Orlando because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) values strange things like houses, bedrooms, and nature. Orlando decides to leave them and sail back to England. On the ship voyage back to England, Orlando becomes romantic with the ship's Captain, Nicholas. Finally she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feels what it is like to be a woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cannot decide which gender she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enjoys more. On returning to England, Orlando meets Archduchess Harriet again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) finds out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) is really a man, Archduke Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) proposes to Orlando, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) too slow and boring to marry. Orlando takes to spending time with famous poets of the eighteenth century like Addison, Dryden, and Pope. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) soon tires of them too, and begins spending time with some London prostitutes, whose stories she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) finds entertaining. As Orlando looks up to the sky above, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sees great clouds come over London; the eighteenth century is over and the nineteenth century has begun. The Victorian era is gloomy; no sunlight gets in and all the vegetation is overgrown. Orlando feels pressure to yield to <div class="bookquote">``the spirit of the age''  (<font color='red'><b>a husband</b></font>)</div>and find a husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) goes out and thinks herself nature's bride, a woman married to the moor. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) falls and twists her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ankle. Just then, a man rides up to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine, Esquire. Within two minutes, they know everything about each other, and know they are meant to be together. Orlando cannot believe that Shel has all the good qualities of a woman, and Shel cannot believe that Orlando has all the good qualities of a man. But Shel is a seaman, and when the wind changes, he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) must leave to do his (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) duty on his (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) ship. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) goes, he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) marries Orlando in a hasty but romantic ceremony. Orlando finally finishes the manuscript of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poem, <div class="bookquote">``the Oak Tree,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) travels to London. There she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meets Nick Greene, who is now the most eminent Victorian literary critic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greene</b></font>) reads her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poem and is very impressed by it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Greene</b></font>) promises to have it published with excellent reviews. It is now 1901, and as King Edward VII succeeds Queen Victoria on the throne, the world becomes much brighter, if more desperate. Suddenly a light becomes very bright, and Orlando is struck ten times on the head. It is 10 AM on Thursday, October 11, 1928; Orlando has been struck by the present; she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) is thirty-six. Orlando goes to the store, smells a candle, and thinks it is Sasha. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) realizes that everything is now connected to something else. On the drive home from the store, Orlando thinks about all the different selves that compose her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) calls for the one that is the real Orlando, and then realizes that it is all of them. The present frightens Orlando. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) goes out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) oak tree to bury her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) book, but decides against it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) looks out over her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) house, thinking how it now belongs to history as well as to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) thinks that her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) husband's ship is safe and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) cries out his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) name. Then Orlando sees the dead Queen coming once again to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) hears an airplane above and bears her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) breast to the sky. Shel, now a fine sea captain, leaps down. As he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) does this, a wild bird springs up. The clock strikes midnight, and it is the present.
