Their dogs disappear as they are lured by a she-wolf and eaten by the pack. They only have three bullets left and Bill, one of the men, uses them to try to save one of their dogs; he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) misses and is eaten with the dog. Only Henry and two dogs are left; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) makes a fire, trying to drive away the wolves. They draw in close, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is almost eaten, saved only by a company of men who were traveling nearby. The wolves are in the midst of a famine. They continue on, lead by several wolves alongside the she-wolf, and when they finally find food the pack starts to split up. The she-wolf mates with one of the wolves and has a litter of pups. Only one survives after several more famines, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) grows strong and is a feisty pup. They come to an Indian village where the she-wolf's -LRB-who is actually half-wolf, half-dog-RRB- master is. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) catches her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) again and White Fang, her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pup, stays nearby. Soon, she (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is sold to another Indian, while White Fang stays with Gray Beaver, her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) master. The other dogs of the village terrorize White Fang, especially one named Lip-lip. White Fang becomes more and more vicious, encouraged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) master. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) kills other dogs. Gray Beaver goes to Fort Yukon to trade and discovers whiskey. White Fang is passed into the hands of Beauty Smith, a monster of a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) fights other dogs until he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) meets his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) match in a bulldog and is saved only by a man named Scott. Scott tames White Fang and takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) back to California with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>). There White Fang learns to love his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) master and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) master's family and even saves Scott's father from a criminal that escaped from the nearby prison. White Fang has puppies with Collie, one of the master's dogs, and lives a happy life.
