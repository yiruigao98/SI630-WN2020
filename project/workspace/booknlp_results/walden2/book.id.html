Burris remembers that Frazier was a classmate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frazier</b></font>) in graduate school, one with radical ideas and a distaste for the establishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frazier</b></font>) sends a letter to Frazier and immediately gets a reply inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Frazier</b></font>) to visit the community. Burris agrees to take time off from his (<font color='blue'><b>Burris</b></font>) academic duties to accompany Rogers and Steve on a visit to <div class="bookquote">``Walden Two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Steve</b></font>)</div>Frazier's community. Rodge's girlfriend Barbara, Steve's girlfriend Mary, and Burris's colleague Castle also come. Upon their arrival at Walden Two, they are greeted by Frazier. Over the course of their three-day visit, they are given a tour of Walden Two, a taste of what it is like to live and work there, and an earful of talk from Frazier about the planning that lies behind this utopian community. The population of Walden Two is about one thousand people, all of whom seem to be healthy and happy. They live in communal dwellings, eat in common dining spaces, raise their children in a communal nursery, and grow and build much of what they need. The standard workday lasts only four hours, or less; no one is paid wages--but nothing at Walden Two costs money. How does Walden Two achieve this utopia? Through a science of behavior. Everything that is done at Walden Two is based on principles of behaviorism, the idea that human behavior can be controlled by manipulating contingencies of reward and, to a lesser extent, punishment. From an early age, members of Walden Two are conditioned to be productive and happy members of society. In line with its basis in science, Walden Two is an inherently experimental community. If there is evidence that a new social practice -LRB-e.g., not saying <div class="bookquote">``thank you'' (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>-RRB- will make people happier and healthier, it is immediately implemented and its consequences are carefully monitored. Each of the visitors responds to the community differently. Castle finds it abhorrent; he (<font color='blue'><b>Walden</b></font>) spends the duration of the visit arguing with Frazier about the feasibility and desirability of a community like Walden Two. Burris, on the other hand, finds himself somewhere in the middle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Burris</b></font>) is skeptical that such a utopia could work, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Burris</b></font>) finds Frazier's arguments compelling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frazier</b></font>) cannot discount the evidence of success in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frazier</b></font>). Steve and Mary are both convinced that this is the life for them; they decide to stay at Walden Two. Rodge, too, is convinced, but Barbara is not; he (<font color='blue'><b>Walden</b></font>) grudgingly leaves Walden Two with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) at the end of their visit. Burris is torn, but decides to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Burris</b></font>) academic life. However, at the train station he (<font color='blue'><b>Burris</b></font>) suddenly realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Burris</b></font>) would rather try life at Walden Two, for whatever it's worth, than go back to the university. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walden</b></font>) walks back to Walden Two and begins his (<font color='blue'><b>Two</b></font>) new life there. In the last chapter, an epilogue, he (<font color='blue'><b>Two</b></font>) and Frazier discuss the writing and publishing of the preceding narrative as a way of spreading the word about Walden Two.
