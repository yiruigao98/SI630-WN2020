Moses is a middle-aged college professor living temporarily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) country home in the Berkshires. Moses has made a habit of writing letters, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) never sends, to family, friends, acquaintances, scholars, writers, and the dead. These letters make up much of the novel. Moses decides to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) friends at Martha's Vineyard, mostly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) wants to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) lover, Ramona. Almost immediately up arriving at the Vineyard, however, Moses decides to return to New York, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) writes letters compulsively. Moses spends the next night with Ramona. The following morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) decides he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) must act somehow, and determines to fight his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) ex-wife, Madeleine, for custody of their daughter, June. June's babysitter wrote a letter accusing Valentine Gersbach, Moses' best friend and Madeleine's lover, of treating June badly. According to the babysitter, Valentine locked the child in the car while he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) and Madeleine argued. Moses calls his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) lawyer, Simkin, and arranges a meeting in the courthouse. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) waits for Simkin, Moses witnesses several cases ranging from prostitution to a mother's murder of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter. The next day, Moses impulsively flies to Chicago to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) daughter. In Chicago, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) goes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) childhood home, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) widowed stepmother, Tante Taube, still lives. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) goes to the desk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) late father, Jonah Herzog, and takes Jonah's old gun and some Russian rubles. Moses considers murdering his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) ex-wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) lover with the gun. After spying on Madeleine and Valentine through a window of their house, however, Moses realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) will not kill them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) goes to Phoebe Gersbach, Valentine's wife, and asks for her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) help in gaining custody of June, but Phoebe refuses to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>). Moses spends the night with his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) good friend Lucas Asphalter. Through Lucas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) arranges to meet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) daughter. The next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) takes June to the aquarium. As they leave the aquarium, Moses gets into a car accident. June is not hurt, but Moses is knocked unconscious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) wakes up to find himself at the feet of the police. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) is charged with possession of a weapon and taken to jail. His (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) brother Will bails him (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) out. Will is worried for Moses. Later, the brothers meet in the Berkshires. Will suggests that Moses allow himself to be taken to a hospital for observed rest under the care of a psychiatrist. Moses had once had the same idea himself, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) rejects it and remains in the Berkshires. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) arranges a night with Ramona, who comes to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>). By the end of the novel, Moses has found contentment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) country home and the pleasant weather. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) feels he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) does not need to write any more letters. Other important facts arise, not in the course of the main plot, but through Moses' letters and memory. We learn that before Moses married Madeleine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) was married to a woman named Daisy, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) had had a son named Marco. We also learn that Moses was raised in a Jewish immigrant family in LaRoux, Canada, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) father Johan failed in many business ventures and eventually became a bootlegger. Moses also recounts tales of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) brothers and sister -LRB-Will, Shura, and Helen-RRB-. Moses constantly mentions his (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) efforts as a writer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) published one book entitled Romanticism and Christianity, which gained critical acclaim as time passed, despite an initially chilly critical response. His (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) never completed the intended second volume of the book.
