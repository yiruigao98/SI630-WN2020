early nineteenth- century Jamaica. The white daughter of ex-slave
owners, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lives on a run-down plantation called Coulibri Estate.
Five years have passed since her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, Mr. Cosway, reportedly
drunk himself to death, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) finances in ruins after the passage
of the Emancipation Act of 1833,
which freed black slaves and led to the demise of many white slave
owners. Throughout Antoinette's childhood, hostility flares between
the crumbling white aristocracy and the impoverished servants they
employ. As a young girl, Antoinette lives at Coulibri Estate with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) widowed mother, Annette, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sickly younger brother, Pierre,
and gossiping servants who seem particularly attuned to their employers' misfortune
and social disrepute. Antoinette spends her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) days in isolation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>)
mother, a beautiful young woman who is ostracized by the Jamaican
elite, spends little time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>), choosing to pace listlessly
on the house's glacis -LRB-the covered balcony-RRB- instead
of nurturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) child. Antoinette's only companion, Tia, the daughter
of a servant, turns against her (<font color='blue'><b>Tia</b></font>) unexpectedly. One day, Antoinette is surprised to find a group of elegant
visitors calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) mother from Spanish Town, the island's version of
a sophisticated metropolis. Among them is an English man named Mr.
Mason who, after a short courtship, asks for Annette's hand in marriage.
When Mr. Mason and Annette honeymoon in Trinidad, Antoinette and
Pierre stay with their Aunt Cora in Spanish Town. In the interim, Mr. Mason has had the estate repaired
and restored to it to its former grandeur, and has bought new servants. Discontent,
however, is rising among the freed blacks, who protest one night
outside the house. Bearing torches, they accidentally set the house
on fire, and Pierre is badly hurt. As the family flees the house,
Antoinette runs desperately towards Tia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) mother. Tia throws
a jagged rock at Antoinette, cutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) forehead and drawing blood. The events of the night leave Antoinette dangerously ill
for six weeks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) wakes to find herself in Aunt Cora's care. Pierre
has died. Annette's madness, which has revealed itself gradually
over the years, has fully surfaced after the trauma of the fire.
When Antoinette visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) mother, who has been placed in the care
of a black couple, she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) hardly recognizes the ghostlike figure she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>)
encounters. When Antoinette approaches, Annette violently flings
her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) away. Antoinette then enrolls in convent school along with other
young Creole girls. For several years, she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) lives at the school with
the nuns, learning everything from proper ladylike deportment to
the tortured histories of female saints. Antoinette's family has
all but deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>): Aunt Cora has moved to England for a year,
while Mr. Mason travels for months away from Jamaica, visiting only
occasionally. When Antoinette is seventeen, Mr. Mason announces on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>)
visit that friends from England will be coming the following winter.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) means to present Antoinette into society as a cultivated woman,
fit for marriage. At this point, the end of Part One, Antoinette's
narration becomes increasingly muddled, jumping from present- tense descriptions
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) life in the convent to muddled recollections of past events. Antoinette's husband, an Englishman who remains nameless, narrates
Part Two. After a wedding ceremony in Spanish Town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) and Antoinette
honeymoon on one of the Windward Islands, at an estate that once
belonged to Antoinette's mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) begins to have misgivings about
the marriage as they approach a town ominously called Massacre.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) knows little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) new wife, having agreed to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) days
before, when Mr. Mason's son, Richard Mason, offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) #30,000 if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) proposed. Desperate for money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) agreed to the marriage. When the couple arrives at Granbois, Antoinette's inherited estate,
the man feels increasingly uncomfortable around the servants and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strange young wife. Hostility grows between the man and Christophine,
Antoinette's surrogate mother and a servant who wields great power
in the house. The man soon receives a menacing letter from Daniel
Cosway, one of old Cosway's illegitimate children. Venomous in tone,
letter warns of Antoinette's depravity, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) comes from
a family of derelicts and has madness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) blood. After reading
this letter, the man begins to detect signs of Antoinette's insanity. Antoinette, sensing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) husband hates her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>), asks Christophine
for a magic love potion. Christophine grudgingly agrees. That night,
when the man confronts Antoinette about her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) past, they argue passionately.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) awakes the next morning believing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been poisoned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
later sleeps with the servant girl, Amelie, who helps him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recover.
Sitting in the next room, Antoinette hears everything. The next morning, Antoinette leaves for Christophine's.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) returns, she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) seems to be totally mad. Drunk and raving,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) pleads with the man to stop calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Bertha,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>a name he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has given her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) without explanation. Antoinette then bites her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) husband's arm,
drawing blood. After she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) collapses and falls in bed, Christophine
rails at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cruelty. That night, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) decides to leave Jamaica
with Antoinette. Antoinette narrates Part Three from England, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>)
is locked away in a garret room in her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) husband's house, under the watch
of a servant, Grace Poole. A hidden captive, Antoinette has no sense
of time or place; she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) does not even believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) is in England when
Grace tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) so. Violent and frenzied, Antoinette draws a knife
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) stepbrother, Richard Mason, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>). Later she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>)
has no memory of the incident. Antoinette has a recurring dream about
taking Grace's keys and exploring the house's downstairs quarters.
In this dream, she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) lights candles and sets the house ablaze. One
night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) wakes from this dream and feels she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) must act on it. The
novel ends with Antoinette holding a candle and walking down from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) upstairs prison.
