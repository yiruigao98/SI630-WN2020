Adela Quested and the elderly Mrs. Moore, travel to India. Adela
expects to become engaged to Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny, a British magistrate
in the Indian city of Chandrapore. Adela and Mrs. Moore each hope
to see the real India during their visit, rather than cultural institutions
imported by the British. At the same time, Aziz, a young Muslim doctor in India,
is increasingly frustrated by the poor treatment he (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) receives at
the hands of the English. Aziz is especially annoyed with Major
Callendar, the civil surgeon, who has a tendency to summon Aziz
for frivolous reasons in the middle of dinner. Aziz and two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>)
educated friends, Hamidullah and Mahmoud Ali, hold a lively conversation about
whether or not an Indian can be friends with an Englishman in India.
That night, Mrs. Moore and Aziz happen to run into each other while
exploring a local mosque, and the two become friendly. Aziz is moved
and surprised that an English person would treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) like a friend. Mr. Turton, the collector who governs Chandrapore, hosts
a party so that Adela and Mrs. Moore may have the opportunity to meet
some of the more prominent and wealthy Indians in the city. At the
event, which proves to be rather awkward, Adela meets Cyril Fielding,
the principal of the government college in Chandrapore. Fielding,
impressed with Adela's open friendliness to the Indians, invites
her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) and Mrs. Moore to tea with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fielding</b></font>) and the Hindu professor Godbole.
At Adela's request, Fielding invites Aziz to tea as well. At the tea, Aziz and Fielding immediately become friendly,
and the afternoon is overwhelmingly pleasant until Ronny Heaslop arrives
and rudely interrupts the party. Later that evening, Adela tells
Ronny that she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) has decided not to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Ronny</b></font>). But that night, the
two are in a car accident together, and the excitement of the event
causes Adela to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) mind about the marriage. Not long afterward, Aziz organizes an expedition to the
nearby Marabar Caves for those who attended Fielding's tea. Fielding
and Professor Godbole miss the train to Marabar, so Aziz continues
on alone with the two ladies, Adela and Mrs. Moore. Inside one of
the caves, Mrs. Moore is unnerved by the enclosed space, which is crowded
with Aziz's retinue, and by the uncanny echo that seems to translate
every sound she (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) makes into the noise <div class="bookquote">``boum.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Aziz, Adela, and a guide go on to the higher caves while
Mrs. Moore waits below. Adela, suddenly realizing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) does
not love Ronny, asks Aziz whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) has more than one wife--a question
he (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) considers offensive. Aziz storms off into a cave, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) returns,
Adela is gone. Aziz scolds the guide for losing Adela, and the guide
runs away. Aziz finds Adela's broken field‑glasses and heads down
the hill. Back at the picnic site, Aziz finds Fielding waiting for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>). Aziz is unconcerned to learn that Adela has hastily taken a
car back to Chandrapore, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) is overjoyed to see Fielding. Back
in Chandrapore, however, Aziz is unexpectedly arrested. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) is charged
with attempting to rape Adela Quested while she (<font color='blue'><b>Quested</b></font>) was in the caves,
a charge based on a claim Adela herself has made. Fielding, believing Aziz to be innocent, angers all of
British India by joining the Indians in Aziz's defense. In the weeks
before the trial, the racial tensions between the Indians and the
English flare up considerably. Mrs. Moore is distracted and miserable
because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) memory of the echo in the cave and because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>)
impatience with the upcoming trial. Adela is emotional and ill;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) too seems to suffer from an echo in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) mind. Ronny is fed up
with Mrs. Moore's lack of support for Adela, and it is agreed that
Mrs. Moore will return to England earlier than planned. Mrs. Moore
dies on the voyage back to England, but not before she (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) realizes
that there is no <div class="bookquote">``real India'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--but rather a complex multitude of
different Indias. At Aziz's trial, Adela, under oath, is questioned about
what happened in the caves. Shockingly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) declares that she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) has
made a mistake: Aziz is not the person or thing that attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>)
in the cave. Aziz is set free, and Fielding escorts Adela to the
Government College, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) spends the next several weeks. Fielding
begins to respect Adela, recognizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) bravery in standing against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) peers to pronounce Aziz innocent. Ronny breaks off his (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) engagement
to Adela, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) returns to England. Aziz, however, is angry that Fielding would befriend Adela
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) nearly ruined Aziz's life, and the friendship between
the two men suffers as a consequence. Then Fielding sails for a
visit to England. Aziz declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) is done with the English
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) intends to move to a place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) will not have to
encounter them. Two years later, Aziz has become the chief doctor to the
Rajah of Mau, a Hindu region several hundred miles from Chandrapore.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) has heard that Fielding married Adela shortly after returning
to England. Aziz now virulently hates all English people. One day, walking
through an old temple with his (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) three children, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) encounters Fielding
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) brother‑in‑law. Aziz is surprised to learn that the brother-in-law's
name is Ralph Moore; it turns out that Fielding married not Adela
Quested, but Stella Moore, Mrs. Moore's daughter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) second
marriage. Aziz befriends Ralph. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) accidentally runs his (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) rowboat
into Fielding's, Aziz renews his (<font color='blue'><b>Aziz</b></font>) friendship with Fielding as well.
The two men go for a final ride together before Fielding leaves,
during which Aziz tells Fielding that once the English are out of
India, the two will be able to be friends. Fielding asks why they
cannot be friends now, when they both want to be, but the sky and
the earth seem to say <div class="bookquote">``No, not yet... . No, not there.''
