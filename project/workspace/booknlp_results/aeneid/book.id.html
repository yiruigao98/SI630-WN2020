and his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) fellow Trojans flee from their home city of Troy, which
has been destroyed by the Greeks. They sail for Italy, where Aeneas
is destined to found Rome. As they near their destination, a fierce
storm throws them off course and lands them in Carthage. Dido, Carthage's
founder and queen, welcomes them. Aeneas relates to Dido the long
and painful story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) group's travels thus far. Aeneas tells of the sack of Troy that ended the Trojan
War after ten years of Greek siege. In the final campaign, the Trojans
were tricked when they accepted into their city walls a wooden horse that,
unbeknownst to them, harbored several Greek soldiers in its hollow
belly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) tells how he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) escaped the burning city with his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) father,
Anchises; his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) son, Ascanius; and the hearth gods that represent
their fallen city. Assured by the gods that a glorious future awaited
him (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) in Italy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) set sail with a fleet containing the surviving citizens
of Troy. Aeneas relates the ordeals they faced on their journey.
Twice they attempted to build a new city, only to be driven away
by bad omens and plagues. Harpies, creatures that are part woman
and part bird, cursed them, but they also encountered friendly countrymen
unexpectedly. Finally, after the loss of Anchises and a bout of
terrible weather, they made their way to Carthage. Impressed by Aeneas's exploits and sympathetic to his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>)
suffering, Dido, a Phoenician princess who fled her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) home
and founded Carthage after her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) brother murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband, falls
in love with Aeneas. They live together as lovers for a period,
until the gods remind Aeneas of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) duty to found a new city. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>)
determines to set sail once again. Dido is devastated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) departure, and
kills herself by ordering a huge pyre to be built with Aeneas's castaway
possessions, climbing upon it, and stabbing herself with the sword
Aeneas leaves behind. As the Trojans make for Italy, bad weather blows them
to Sicily, where they hold funeral games for the dead Anchises.
The women, tired of the voyage, begin to burn the ships, but a downpour
puts the fires out. Some of the travel-weary stay behind, while
Aeneas, reinvigorated after his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) father visits him (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) in a dream, takes
the rest on toward Italy. Once there, Aeneas descends into the underworld, guided
by the Sibyl of Cumae, to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) is shown a pageant
of the future history and heroes of Rome, which helps him (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) to understand
the importance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) mission. Aeneas returns from the underworld,
and the Trojans continue up the coast to the region of Latium. The arrival of the Trojans in Italy begins peacefully.
King Latinus, the Italian ruler, extends his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hospitality, hoping
that Aeneas will prove to be the foreigner whom, according to a
prophecy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) daughter Lavinia is supposed to marry. But Latinus's
wife, Amata, has other ideas. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) means for Lavinia to marry Turnus,
a local suitor. Amata and Turnus cultivate enmity toward the newly
arrived Trojans. Meanwhile, Ascanius hunts a stag that was a pet
of the local herdsmen. A fight breaks out, and several people are
killed. Turnus, riding this current of anger, begins a war. Aeneas, at the suggestion of the river god Tiberinus,
sails north up the Tiber to seek military support among the neighboring
tribes. During this voyage, his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) mother, Venus, descends to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) a new set of weapons, wrought by Vulcan. While the Trojan leader
is away, Turnus attacks. Aeneas returns to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) countrymen embroiled
in battle. Pallas, the son of Aeneas's new ally Evander, is killed
by Turnus. Aeneas flies into a violent fury, and many more are slain
by the day's end. The two sides agree to a truce so that they can bury
the dead, and the Latin leaders discuss whether to continue the
battle. They decide to spare any further unnecessary carnage by
proposing a hand-to-hand duel between Aeneas and Turnus. When the
two leaders face off, however, the other men begin to quarrel, and
full-scale battle resumes. Aeneas is wounded in the thigh, but eventually
the Trojans threaten the enemy city. Turnus rushes out to meet Aeneas,
who wounds Turnus badly. Aeneas nearly spares Turnus but, remembering
the slain Pallas, slays him (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) instead.
