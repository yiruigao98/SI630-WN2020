A beacon flashes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Watchman</b></font>) joyfully runs to tell the news to Queen Clytemnestra. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Watchman</b></font>) is gone, the Chorus, made up of the old men of Argos, enters and tells the story of how the Trojan Prince Paris stole Helen, the wife of the Greek king Menelaus, leading to ten years of war between Greece and Troy. Then the Chorus recalls how Clytemnestra's husband Agamemnon -LRB-Menelaus' brother-RRB- sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia to the god Artemis to obtain a favorable wind for the Greek fleet. The Queen appears, and the Chorus asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) has ordered sacrifices of thanksgiving. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) tells them that a system of beacons has brought word that Troy fell the previous night. The Chorus give thanks to the gods, but wonder if her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) news is true; a Herald appears and confirms the tidings, describing the army's sufferings at Troy and giving thanks for a safe homecoming. Clytemnestra sends him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) back to Agamemnon, to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) husband to come swiftly, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) departs, the Chorus asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) for news of Menelaus. The Herald replies that a terrible storm seized the Greek fleet on the way home, leaving Menelaus and many others missing. The Chorus sings of the terrible destructive power of Helen's beauty. Agamemnon enters, riding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) chariot with Cassandra, a Trojan Princess whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) has taken as his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) slave and concubine. Clytemnestra welcomes him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>), professing her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) love, and orders a carpet of purple robes spread in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) enters the palace. Agamemnon acts coldly toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and says that to walk on the carpet would be an act of hubris, or dangerous pride; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) badgers him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) into walking on the robes, however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) enters the palace. The Chorus expresses a sense of foreboding, and Clytemnestra comes outside to order Cassandra inside. The Trojan Princess is silent, and the Queen leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) in frustration. Then Cassandra begins to speak, uttering incoherent prophecies about a curse on the house of Agamemnon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cassandra</b></font>) tells the Chorus that they will see their king dead, says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cassandra</b></font>) will die as well, and then predicts that an avenger will come. After these bold predictions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cassandra</b></font>) seems resigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cassandra</b></font>) fate, and enters the house. The Chorus' fears grow, and they hear Agamemnon cry out in pain from inside. As they debate what to do, the doors open, and Clytemnestra appears, standing over the corpses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cassandra</b></font>) husband and Cassandra. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cassandra</b></font>) declares that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cassandra</b></font>) has killed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to avenge Iphigenia, and then is joined by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cassandra</b></font>) lover Aegisthus, Agamemnon's cousin, whose brothers were cooked and served to Aegisthus' father by Agamemnon's father. They take over the government, and the Chorus declares that Clytemnestra's son Orestes will return from exile to avenge his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father.
