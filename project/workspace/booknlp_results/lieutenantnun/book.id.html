1585, is placed in a Dominican convent, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) trains until the age of fifteen to
become a nun. On March 18, 1600, Catalina runs away from the convent and fashions
herself a suit of male clothes out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) convent garments. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) begins her (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) life
as a man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) obtains a number of jobs, including one as a page for the king's
secretary. While in his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) employ, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) encounters her (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) father, who is petitioning for
help in finding his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) missing daughter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) father does not recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) again
tempts fate and returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) old convent for mass, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) mother is in
attendance. Catalina's mother also does not recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Catalina's journeys through the New World begin when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) meets her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uncle, a
sea captain who, not recognizing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), signs her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on as a ship's boy. Eventually
Catalina flees the ship, stealing money from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uncle as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) leaves for Panama, and
embarks on a series of jobs and adventures. A number of violent episodes ensue,
which often lead Catalina to flee into a local church for safety. At that time,
police were barred from invading the sanctity of a church, thus granting criminals
inside sanctuary. Catalina's tendency to get into violent and criminal scrapes leads
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to take frequent advantage of this legal loophole. Catalina also has a number of problematic encounters with young ladies. Some
want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to ward off their advances. But in one situation,
Catalina is dismissed from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) position for inappropriate behavior with the
sister-in-law of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) master. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) signs up for the army and soon travels to Chile,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) becomes a soldier for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother, who does not recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Although
they generally get along well, after three years they fight over a woman, and
Catalina is banished to another town. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manages to distinguish herself in battle,
both for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bravery and for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) propensity for violence. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kills many people,
both on and off the battlefield, and is constantly running from the law. When a friend asks her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) second in a duel, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) agrees. During the
course of the duel, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kills the other man's second, who turns out to be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) retreats to the church to avoid arrest, and from there, wracked with
sorrow, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) watches her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother's funeral. After months of hiding out in the church,
Catalina leaves town and joins up with two other army deserters, who eventually die
of starvation during their journey. Catalina is rescued by a half-Indian woman who
wants Catalina to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter. At the same time, a local vicar tries to
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) niece. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) accepts their gifts, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eventually
abandons them both. Catalina assists in suppressing the Alonso Ibáñezi uprising and is part of a
bloody battle where thousands of Indians are butchered. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is accused of committing
a crime that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is innocent of, and although she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is tortured, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refuses to admit
to it. Soon after, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is accused of a murder that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) actually has committed, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refuses to admit to this crime either. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is nearly put to death until a fellow
Basque halts the execution. In Bolivia, the daughter of a nun begs Catalina to help her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) escape her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
husband, who is about to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) for infidelity. The husband then tries to kill
them both, but Catalina gets the woman to the safety of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother's convent.
Catalina then goes to Peru to investigate crimes in the area. Soon after, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kills
a man for insulting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and is sentenced to death. Due to a technicality in the
church doctrine, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gains her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) freedom by taking communion and spitting it into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hand, holding onto the host until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is taken into a church, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is granted
sanctuary. In Lima, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) joins Spanish troops who are being attacked by the Dutch and then
returns to the city of Cuzco, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gets into a bloody fight over a game of
cards. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kills her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opponent, <div class="bookquote">``the Cid,''  (<font color='red'><b>opponent</b></font>)</div>who inflicts mortal wounds on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as well.
Thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is going to die, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) makes a full confession to a priest. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) survives, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is wanted by the law. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brushes with the
constables grow more and more dangerous, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is eventually surrounded by
officers who have been given orders to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). A bishop intervenes and takes
Catalina into the safety of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) house. Catalina finally admits to the bishop that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a woman, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) expresses doubts, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gamely offers to submit to a
medical examination. During the examination, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is proven to be not only a woman
but a virgin, and the bishop vows to help her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is sent to a nunnery while the church investigates her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) past to find out if
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ever took vows to become a nun. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) story spreads far and wide, and by 1620 she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
is well known throughout Spain. When, two years later, it is confirmed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
never took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vows, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is allowed to leave the convent and begin her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life as a
Spanish celebrity. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goes to Madrid and presents herself to the king, who, in
1625, grants her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a pension for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) service to Spain. Catalina travels to Rome, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meets Pope Urban the Eighth and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Urban</b></font>)
about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life and travels. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Urban</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a woman and a virgin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Urban</b></font>)
gives her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) permission to continue to dress in men's clothing. Catalina ends her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) memoir with a short tale about being confronted by two
prostitutes, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) insults because they address her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as a woman.
