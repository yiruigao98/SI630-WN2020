her (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) way to Mississippi in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) baby's father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) hitches
a ride into the small town of Jefferson, which is home to a planing
mill. One of the workers at the mill, Joe Christmas, is a brooding,
racially ambiguous man who appeared suddenly at the mill one day
in search of a job. After gaining employment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was soon joined
at the mill by another man named Joe Brown. The two formed a partnership,
making and selling liquor illegally, and eventually quit their jobs. Another of the mill workers, Byron Bunch, is intrigued
and unsettled when Lena Grove suddenly appears at the mill one day.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bunch</b></font>) tells the town's disgraced former minister, Reverend Gail Hightower,
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hightower</b></font>) efforts to care for the girl. Soon, Lena comes to realize that
the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) seeks--her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) baby's father, Lucas Burch--is really Joe Brown.
Upon Lena's arrival in town, Brown is being held in the town jail
after the murder of a local woman, Joanna Burden, and the burning
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Burden</b></font>) home. Joe Christmas, Miss Burden's occasional lover, is the
chief suspect. The narrative then shifts to explore several of the characters' pasts.
As a young minister, Gail Hightower secures a church in Jefferson
to feed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) obsession with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) grandfather, a Confederate cavalryman
who was killed in the town during the Civil War. Hightower's young
wife is unfaithful and grapples with mental health problems. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
eventually dies in a fall from the window of a Memphis hotel room
where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is staying with another man. A scandal ensues, and the
Jefferson parishioners turn on Hightower, who is forced to step
down. As a child, Joe Christmas is left on the steps of an orphanage. When
the facility's dietician mistakenly believes that Joe has overheard
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) having sex with a young doctor in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) worries she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
will lose her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) job. To eliminate this risk, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) threatens to expose young
Joe's biracial background and thus have him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) transferred to an orphanage
for black children. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) discusses the plan with the orphanage's
janitor, who kidnaps Joe and takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to Little Rock, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
is found and returned, only to be adopted two weeks later by a sternly
religious man, Mr. McEachern, and his (<font color='blue'><b>McEachern</b></font>) wife. Joe's new foster father subjects him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to regular beatings.
As Joe grows and enters puberty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) eventually crosses paths with
Bobbie, a prostitute who works as a waitress in the nearby town.
When Mr. McEachern catches his (<font color='blue'><b>McEachern</b></font>) son at a dance with Bobbie, a fight
erupts, and Joe kills his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) foster father by smashing a chair over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head. Abandoned by Bobbie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) cohorts, Joe embraces a life
on the run and wanders for more than fifteen years, eventually making
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) way to Jefferson. In Jefferson, Joe Christmas stays in the cabin on Joanna
Burden's property, and the two quickly become lovers. Their relationship
is marked by passion, violence, and long periods in which they ignore each
other. Miss Burden wants a child and claims to be pregnant, but
Joe is strongly opposed to the idea. After a time, Joe Brown comes
to live with Joe Christmas in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christmas</b></font>) cabin. Miss Burden tries to help
Joe Christmas financially, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Burden</b></font>) meddling only provokes his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) ire.
One night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) savagely attacks and kills her (<font color='blue'><b>Burden</b></font>) with a razor after
she (<font color='blue'><b>Burden</b></font>) tries to fire a pistol at him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) in an apparent attempt at a murder-suicide. Miss Burden's nephew in New Hampshire offers a $1,000 reward
for the capture of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) aunt's killer. Search parties with bloodhounds
comb the countryside for the fugitive Joe Christmas, who eludes
capture for days, running to the point of hunger and exhaustion.
Lena, meanwhile, moves into the cabin that the two Joes had shared
in order to prepare for the birth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) baby; Byron Bunch stays
in a tent nearby. Joe Christmas is apprehended on the streets of nearby Mottstown.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) biological maternal grandfather, Uncle Doc Hines, makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
way through the crowd to curse Joe and call for his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) death. When
the officials from Jefferson arrive to take charge of the prisoner,
Mrs. Hines breaks through the crowd as well, hoping to see the face
of the grandson who her (<font color='blue'><b>Hines</b></font>) husband told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hines</b></font>) died as a child. The Hineses
then take the train to Jefferson together. Byron and the Hineses arrive at Hightower's house and
reveal that Joe Christmas's father was a circus worker who tried
to run off with the Hineses' daughter before Uncle Doc shot and
killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Doc</b></font>). Eventually, Uncle Doc placed the baby in the orphanage
in Memphis where he (<font color='blue'><b>Doc</b></font>) worked as a janitor. Byron wants Hightower to
lie and claim that Joe Christmas was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Christmas</b></font>), at his (<font color='blue'><b>Christmas</b></font>) house, on
the night of Joanna Burden's murder. Hightower becomes angry and asks
them to leave. Lena goes into labor, but by the time Byron arrives with
the doctor, Hightower has already delivered the baby. Assisting
in the delivery is Mrs. Hines, who mistakenly believes that Lena
is her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) long-dead daughter, Milly, and that the newborn is her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) grandson,
Joe Christmas. Byron arranges to have Joe Brown sent to Lena's cabin; upon
arriving, Brown is shocked to see Lena holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) newborn son,
slips out a back window, and runs away. Byron sees Brown escape
and tries to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>), but the much larger man beats Byron soundly
and escapes on a passing train. Joe Christmas, meanwhile, escapes
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) captors as well, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is being led across the town
square. Before long, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is tracked down, shot, killed, and castrated
in Hightower's kitchen by a bounty hunter named Percy Grimm. Afterward,
the aging Hightower muses on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hightower</b></font>) past and prepares for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hightower</b></font>) own death. After a road trip, a local furniture mover near Jefferson
recounts to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) wife how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) gave a ride to a curious couple--a woman
with a newborn child accompanied by a man who was not the child's father.
The couple--Lena and Byron--was halfheartedly in search of the baby's
biological father, as the man drove them deeper into Tennessee.
