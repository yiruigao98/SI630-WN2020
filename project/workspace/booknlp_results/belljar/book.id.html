Massachusetts, travels to New York to work on a magazine for a month
as a guest editor. She works for Jay Cee, a sympathetic but demanding
woman. Esther and eleven other college girls live in a women's hotel.
The sponsors of their trip wine and dine them and shower them with
presents. Esther knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should be having the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) feels deadened. The execution of the Rosenbergs worries
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) can embrace neither the rebellious attitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
friend Doreen nor the perky conformism of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) friend Betsy. Esther
and the other girls suffer food poisoning after a fancy banquet.
Esther attempts to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) virginity with a UN interpreter, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) seems uninterested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) questions her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) abilities and worries about
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) will do after college. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) last night in the city, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
goes on a disastrous blind date with a man named Marco, who tries
to rape her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Esther wonders if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) should marry and live a conventional domestic
life, or attempt to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ambition. Buddy Willard, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) college
boyfriend, is recovering from tuberculosis in a sanitarium, and
wants to marry Esther when he (<font color='blue'><b>Willard</b></font>) regains his (<font color='blue'><b>Willard</b></font>) health. To an outside observer,
Buddy appears to be the ideal mate: he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddy</b></font>) is handsome, gentle, intelligent,
and ambitious. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddy</b></font>) does not understand Esther's desire to write
poetry, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddy</b></font>) confesses that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddy</b></font>) slept with a waitress while
dating Esther, Esther thinks him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddy</b></font>) a hypocrite and decides she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) cannot
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sets out to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) virginity as though in pursuit
of the answer to an important mystery. Esther returns to the Boston suburbs and discovers that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) has not been accepted to a writing class she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had planned to
take. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) will spend the summer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother instead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) makes
vague plans to write a novel, learn shorthand, and start her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) senior
thesis. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) finds the feelings of unreality she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) experienced
in New York taking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is unable to read, write,
or sleep, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) stops bathing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) mother takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to Dr. Gordon,
a psychiatrist who prescribes electric shock therapy for Esther.
Esther becomes more unstable than ever after this terrifying treatment,
and decides to kill herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tries to slit her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wrists, but can
only bring herself to slash her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) calf. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) tries to hang herself,
but cannot find a place to tie the rope in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) lowâ€‘ceilinged house.
At the beach with friends, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) attempts to drown herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
keeps floating to the surface of the water. Finally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hides in
a basement crawl space and takes a large quantity of sleeping pills. Esther awakens to find herself in the hospital. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) has
survived her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) suicide attempt with no permanent physical injuries.
Once her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) body heals, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is sent to the psychological ward in the
city hospital, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is uncooperative, paranoid, and determined
to end her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) life. Eventually, Philomena Guinea, a famous novelist
who sponsors Esther's college scholarship, pays to move her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to a
private hospital. In this more enlightened environment, Esther comes
to trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) new psychiatrist, a woman named Dr. Nolan. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) slowly
begins to improve with a combination of talk therapy, insulin injections,
and properly administered electric shock therapy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) becomes friends with
Joan, a woman from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hometown and college who has had experiences
similar to Esther's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is repulsed, however, when Joan makes a
sexual advance toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>). As Esther improves, the hospital officials grant her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
permission to leave the hospital from time to time. During one of
these excursions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) finally loses her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) virginity with a math professor
named Irwin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) begins bleeding profusely and has to go to the
emergency room. One morning, Joan, who seemed to be improving, hangs
herself. Buddy comes to visit Esther, and both understand that their
relationship is over. Esther will leave the mental hospital in time
to start winter semester at college. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) believes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) has regained
a tenuous grasp on sanity, but knows that the bell jar of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) madness
could descend again at any time.
