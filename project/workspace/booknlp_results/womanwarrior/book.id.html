The chapters integrate Kingston's lived experience with a series of talk-stories--spoken stories that combine Chinese history, myths, and beliefs--her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) mother tells her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). The first chapter, <div class="bookquote">``No-Name Woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>an aunt</b></font>)</div>begins with one such talk-story, about an aunt Kingston never knew she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had. Because this aunt had brought disgrace upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) family by having an illegitimate child, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) killed herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) baby by jumping into the family well in China. After hearing the story, which is told to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) as a warning, Kingston is never allowed to mention her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) aunt aloud again, so she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) decides to create a history of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) aunt in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) memoir. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) imagines the ways that her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) aunt attracted a suitor, comparing her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) aunt's actions of quiet rebellion against the community to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own rebellion. Kingston also recreates her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) aunt's horrible experience of giving birth in a pigsty and imagines her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) aunt's ghost walking around with no one to give it gifts, as was Chinese custom. In the end, Kingston is unsure whether she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is doing justice to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) aunt's memory or just serving her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own needs. <div class="bookquote">``White Tigers''  (<font color='red'><b>warrior</b></font>)</div>is based on another talk-story, one about the mythical female warrior Fa Mu Lan. Fa Mu Lan, whose story is told through Kingston's first-person narrative, trains to become a warrior from the time she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is seven years old, then leads an army of men--even pretending to be a man herself--against the forces of a corrupt baron and emperor. After her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) battles are over, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) returns to be a wife and mother. The story of Fa Mu Lan is contrasted sharply with Kingston's own life in America, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) can barely stand up to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) racist bosses. Kingston realizes, however, that her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) weapons are her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) words. <div class="bookquote">``Shaman''  (<font color='red'><b>Kingston mother</b></font>)</div>focuses on Kingston's mother, Brave Orchid, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) old life back in China. Brave Orchid was a powerful doctor, midwife, and, according to the talk-story, destroyer of ghosts back in her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) village. To a young Kingston, Brave Orchid's past is as astounding as it is terrifying, and many of the images from her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) mother's talk-story--Chinese babies left to die, slave girls being bought and sold, a woman stoned to death by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) villagers--haunt Kingston's dreams for years to come. At the end of the chapter, Maxine visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Maxine</b></font>) mother after being away for many years. The two arrive at some kind of understanding after many years of disagreement and conflict, and Brave Orchid is warm and affectionate towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Maxine</b></font>) daughter for the first time in the memoir. The title of <div class="bookquote">``At the Western Palace''  (<font color='red'><b>Brave</b></font>)</div>refers to another of Brave Orchid's talk-stories, about an emperor who had four wives. It is an analogy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maxine</b></font>) sister Moon Orchid's situation: Moon Orchid's husband, now a successful Los Angeles doctor, had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maxine</b></font>) behind in China and remarried in America. Brave Orchid urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Maxine</b></font>) sister into a disastrous confrontation with the man to demand her (<font color='blue'><b>Maxine</b></font>) due as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. As a result, Moon Orchid, who does not speak a word of English, is left to fend for herself in America. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maxine</b></font>) eventually goes crazy and dies in a California state mental asylum. The final chapter of the memoir, <div class="bookquote">``A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is about Kingston herself. This section focuses mainly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maxine</b></font>) childhood and teenage years, depicting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maxine</b></font>) anger and frustration in trying to express herself and attempting to please an unappreciative mother. There are a number of characters whose personalities highlight many of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Kingston's own characteristics, including a silent Chinese girl whom Kingston torments as a little girl. In a pivotal moment in the chapter, Kingston, after unsuccessfully trying to express her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feelings one at a time, erupts at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother with a torrent of complaints and criticisms. Later in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life, however, Kingston comes to appreciate her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's talk-stories. At the end of the chapter she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) even tells one herself: the story of Ts`ai Yen, a warrior poetess captured by barbarians who returns to the Chinese with songs from another land. It is a fitting conclusion to a text in which Kingston combines very different worlds and cultures and create a harmony of her (<font color='blue'><b>poetess</b></font>) own.
