A group of judges are gathered together in a private room of the courthouse when Peter Ivanovich, a judge and close friend of Ivan Ilych, announces that Ivan has died. Consoled by the thought that it is Ivan who has died and not them, the men in the room cannot help but think of the promotions and transfers that Ivan's death will occasion. That evening, Peter drives to Ivan's house to attend his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) funeral. But while looking at Ivan's corpse, Peter is bothered by an expression of disapproval and warning on Ivan's face. Ivan's wife Praskovya quizzes Peter about possible strategies to maximize her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dead husband's government pension. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) way out, Peter encounters Gerasim, Ivan's sick nurse. Peter mentions that Ivan's death and funeral are a sad affair, and Gerasim surprises Peter with the observation that everyone dies some day. The story then shifts more than thirty years into the past and picks up with a description of Ivan's life. Ivan is the second of three sons, and in all respects is an average and commonplace person. Around the age of thirteen he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) attends the School of Law where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) assimilates the values and behavior of those with high social standing. Ivan becomes an examining magistrate in the reformed judicial institutions and moves to a new province. Ivan marries and things progress smoothly until Praskovya becomes pregnant. As Praskovya's behavior begins to disrupt the proper and decorous lifestyle cherished by Ivan and approved by society, Ivan increasingly absorbs himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) official work and distances himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) family. At work he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) prides himself on removing all personal concerns from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) consideration, and at home he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) adopts a formal attitude toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) family. Time passes and Ivan moves up in the ranks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) expects to be awarded the post of presiding judge in a University town, but is passed over for promotion. Infuriated and struck by a keen sense of injustice, Ivan obtains a leave of absence and moves with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) family to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother-in-law's house in the country. Conscious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) salary cannot cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) family's living expenses, Ivan travels to St. Petersburg to look for a higher paying job. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) learns that due to a change in the administration of the Ministry of Justice, a close friend has landed a position of great authority. Ivan is awarded a higher paying position in the city, and informing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) family of the good news, Ivan departs alone to buy and furnish a house in preparation for the family's arrival. One day as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is mounting a step-ladder to hang some drapes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) makes a false step and slips, banging his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) side against the window frame. The injury is not serious, however, and Ivan is quite pleased with the final appearance of the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) settles into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) new life and acquires a love of bridge. Ivan begins to experience some discomfort in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) left side and an unusual taste in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mouth. The discomfort gradually increases and soon Ivan is both irritable and quarrelsome. The doctors Ivan visits all disagree on the nature of the illness, and Ivan becomes depressed and fearful. Even cards lose their appeal. Ivan's physical condition degenerates rapidly. One night while lying alone in the dark, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is visited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) first thoughts of mortality, and they terrify him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) realizes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) illness is not a question of health or disease, but of life or death. Praskovya does not understand nor wish to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) husband's plight, and Ivan can barely suppress his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hatred for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). Ivan knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is dying, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is unable to grasp the full implications of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mortality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) tries to erect screens to block the thought of death from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mind, but death haunts him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) ceaselessly. In the midst of this suffering, Gerasim, Ivan's peasant servant, enters the scene. Assigned the task of helping Ivan with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) excretions, Gerasim soon begins passing the entire night with the dying man. To ease his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) pain, Gerasim supports Ivan's legs on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) shoulders. More than any other living person, Gerasim provides Ivan with the compassion and honesty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) needs. Ivan's daily routine is monotonous and maddening. As those around him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) continue to pretend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is only sick and not dying, Ivan feels that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is surrounded by artificiality. No one wants to confront the fact of Ivan's imminent death. Ivan becomes silently enraged, and seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) little son Vasya, Ivan realizes that Vasya is the only one besides Gerasim who understands him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). That night Ivan dreams of a deep black sack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is being violently pushed into the sack, but cannot fall through. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) both fears and desires to fall into it. Awaking from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) dream, Ivan sends Gerasim away, and for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hears the inner voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) soul speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). Twelve more days pass, and Ivan is no longer able to leave the sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) lies pondering death and questioning the rationale behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suffering. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) examines his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) life, Ivan realizes that the further back he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) looks, the more joy there is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) finds that just as the pain grew worse and worse, so too did his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) knows that an explanation for the suffering would be possible if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had not lived rightly, but recalling the propriety of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) resigns himself to the senselessness of death. Then, one night while looking at Gerasim's face, Ivan begins to doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) has lived his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) life correctly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) imagines the black sack again, and the immense agony he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) experiences stems partly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) being thrust into the sack, and partly from not being able to get right into it. The conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) life was a good one prevents him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) from entering the sack, but for some reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is unwilling to relinquish that belief. Suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``some force''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Ilych</b></font>)</div>strikes Ivan in the chest and side. It pushes him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) through the sack and into the presence of a bright light. At that very moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand falls on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sons head and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) feels sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wife approaches his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face wet with tears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) feels sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) realizes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) official life and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) family and social relations were all artificial. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) experiences a sense of extreme joy. In the middle of a sigh, Ivan stretches out and dies.
