one of the earliest attempts to confront human history from a feminist
perspective. It won de Beauvoir many admirers and just as many detractors. Today,
many regard this massive and meticulously researched masterwork
as not only as pillar of feminist thought but of twentieth-century
philosophy in general. De Beauvoir's primary thesis is that men fundamentally
oppress women by characterizing them, on every level, as the Other,
defined exclusively in opposition to men. Man occupies the role
of the self, or subject; woman is the object, the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is essential,
absolute, and transcendent. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is inessential, incomplete, and
mutilated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) extends out into the world to impose his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) will on it,
whereas woman is doomed to immanence, or inwardness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) creates,
acts, invents; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waits for him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) to save her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). This distinction is
the basis of all de Beauvoir's later arguments. De Beauvoir states that while it is natural for humans
to understand themselves in opposition to others, this process is
flawed when applied to the genders. In defining woman exclusively
as Other, man is effectively denying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) humanity. The Second Sex chronicles de Beauvoir's
effort to locate the source of these profoundly imbalanced gender
roles. In Book I, entitled <div class="bookquote">``Facts and Myths,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asks how <div class="bookquote">``female
humans''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>come to occupy a subordinate position in society. To answer
this question--and to better understand her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own identity--de Beauvoir
first turns to biology, psychoanalysis, and historical materialism.
These disciplines reveal indisputable <div class="bookquote">``essential''  (<font color='red'><b>men women</b></font>)</div>differences between
men and women but provide no justification for woman's inferiority.
They all take woman's inferior <div class="bookquote">``destiny''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>for granted. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) then moves to history to trace the emergence of male
superiority in society, from nomadic hunter-gatherers through the
French Revolution and contemporary times. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finds ample examples
of female subordination, but again, no persuasive justification for
them. History, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) argues, is not an immutable <div class="bookquote">``fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but a reflection
of certain attitudes, preconceptions, and injustices. De Beauvoir next discusses various mythical representations
of women and demonstrates how these myths have imprinted human consciousness,
often to the disservice of women. De Beauvoir hopes to debunk the
persistent myth of the <div class="bookquote">``eternal feminine''  (<font color='red'><b>De Beauvoir/de Beauvoir</b></font>)</div>by showing that it arose
from male discomfort with the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beauvoir</b></font>) own birth. Throughout
history, maternity has been both worshipped and reviled: the mother
both brings life and heralds death. These mysterious operations
get projected onto the woman, who is transformed into a symbol of
<div class="bookquote">``life''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>and in the process is robbed of all individuality. To illustrate
the prevalence of these myths, de Beauvoir studies the portrayal
of women by five modern writers. In the end of this section, de
Beauvoir examines the impact of these myths on individual experience.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) concludes that the <div class="bookquote">``eternal feminine''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>fiction is reinforced
by biology, psychoanalysis, history, and literature. De Beauvoir insists on the impossibility of comparing
the <div class="bookquote">``character''  (<font color='red'><b>De Beauvoir/de Beauvoir</b></font>)</div>of men and women without considering the immense
differences in their situation, and in Book II, entitled <div class="bookquote">``Woman's
Life Today,''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) turns to the concrete realities of this situation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) traces female development through its formative stages: childhood, youth,
and sexual initiation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) goal is to prove that women are not born <div class="bookquote">``feminine''
 (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>but shaped by a thousand external processes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) shows how, at each
stage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) upbringing, a girl is conditioned into accepting passivity,
dependence, repetition, and inwardness. Every force in society conspires
to deprive her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) of subjectivity and flatten her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) into an object. Denied
the possibility of independent work or creative fulfillment, the
woman must accept a dissatisfying life of housework, childbearing,
and sexual slavishness. Having brought the woman to adulthood, de Beauvoir analyzes the
various <div class="bookquote">``situations,''  (<font color='red'><b>De Beauvoir/de Beauvoir</b></font>)</div>or roles, the adult woman inhabits. The bourgeois
woman performs three major functions: wife, mother, and entertainer.
No matter how illustrious the woman's household may be, these roles
inevitably lead to immanence, incompleteness, and profound frustration.
Even those who accept a less conventional place in society--as a
prostitute or courtesan, for example--must submit to imperatives
defined by the male. De Beauvoir also reflects on the trauma of
old age. When a woman loses her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reproductive capacity, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loses
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) primary purpose and therefore her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) identity. In the final chapter
of this section, <div class="bookquote">``Woman's Situation and Character,''  (<font color='red'><b>De Beauvoir/de Beauvoir</b></font>)</div>de Beauvoir
reiterates the controversial claim that woman's situation is not a
result of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) character. Rather, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) character is a result of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
situation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mediocrity, complacency, lack of accomplishment,
laziness, passivity--all these qualities are the consequences of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) subordination, not the cause. In <div class="bookquote">``Justifications,''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>de Beauvoir studies some of the ways
that women reinforce their own dependency. Narcissists, women in
love, and mystics all embrace their immanence by drowning selfhood
in an external object--whether it be the mirror, a lover, or God. Throughout
the book, de Beauvoir mentions such instances of females being complicit
in their Otherness, particularly with regard to marriage. The difficulty
of breaking free from <div class="bookquote">``femininity'' (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>--of sacrificing security and comfort
for some ill-conceived notion of <div class="bookquote">``equality'' (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>--induces many women to
accept the usual unfulfilling roles of wife and mother. From the
very beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) discussion, de Beauvoir identifies the economic
underpinnings of female subordination--and the economic roots of
woman's liberation. Only in work can she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) achieve autonomy. If woman
can support herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can also achieve a form of liberation.
In the concluding chapters of The Second Sex, de
Beauvoir discusses the logistical hurdles woman faces in pursuing
this goal.
