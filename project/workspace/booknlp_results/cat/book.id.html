While undressing, Maggie complains that his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) brother Gooper and wife Mae have been having their monstrous children perform for Big Daddy, incessantly reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) of their own childlessness. Now that Daddy is dying of cancer, Mae and Gooper are trying to cut them out of the estate. The doctors have lied to Daddy and Mama, claiming that Daddy only suffers from a spastic colon, but tonight the truth will be revealed. Brick is not helping any with his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) incessant drinking and much-publicized stunt on the high school athletic field. Brick broke his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) ankle jumping hurdles. Maggie is confident of their advantage, because Big Daddy dotes on Brick, abhors Gooper and his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) wife, and has a <div class="bookquote">``lech''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>for Maggie herself. Suddenly Maggie catches sight of Brick staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in the mirror. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cries that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has become hard and frantic. Living with someone who does not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``cat on a hot tin roof.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Fiercely Maggie locks the door and draws the curtains. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) attempts to seduce him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>), Brick warns her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) against making a fool of herself. Maggie murmurs she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has realized her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mistake: she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should not have confessed to making love with Skipper. Maggie continues and says that Brick and Skipper's love was sad and awful because it could never be satisfied or even talked about. Maggie recalls how on their double dates in college it always seemed the boys were out together. The night of the Thanksgiving game, Maggie confronted Skipper on his (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>) desire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>) made a pitiful attempt to prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wrong. Threatening to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), Brick hurls his (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>) crutch at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Maggie insists that now is her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) time of the month to conceive and they must make love. Brick wonders how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) plans to have a child by a man who cannot stand her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Big Daddy enters ferociously and greets Brick. The servants enter with Daddy's cake, and a grotesque sing-a-long commences. Daddy furiously orders everyone to stop. Mama sobs that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has never believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't it be funny if that was true''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Daddy murmurs. Daddy bellows for Brick. Maggie delivers him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a kiss on the mouth that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediately wipes off. Daddy asks Brick why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wiped off her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kiss. Mae and Gooper have been saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't sleep with Maggie. As Brick freshens his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drink, Daddy asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) drinking problem. Brick cannot explain. Drawing Brick close, Daddy recalls his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) world tour with Mama. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) anxiously closes the doors and asks if Brick has ever been terrified of anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) aims to cut loose and get himself a woman. Brick explains that he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) has not gotten the click in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) head that makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) peaceful, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) attempts to flee his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) father. Daddy makes Brick a deal: he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) a drink if he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) drinks. Daddy knows that Brick is lying since he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) started drinking when Skipper died. Daddy asks if there was something <div class="bookquote">``abnormal''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in their friendship. Daddy replies that having just come from <div class="bookquote">``death's country,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>) is not easily shocked. Brick insists that his (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>) friendship with Skipper was clean and true until Maggie got the idea Daddy is talking about. Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>) back injury, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put the idea into Skipper's head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>) became a lush and died. Daddy knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>) is not telling the full story and Brick says that Skipper made a drunken confession to him (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>) over the phone, and Brick hung up on him (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>). Brick's disgust with mendacity is disgust with himself. Daddy curses the <div class="bookquote">``lying dying liars''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>around him (<font color='blue'><b>Skipper</b></font>) and goes to bed. Mae appears, and the family soon follows. Now that Daddy has gone to bed, they can finally talk. The family surrounds Mama and begins to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) of Daddy's cancer. Mama calls for Brick, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``only son.''  (<font color='red'><b>Brick</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) implores Maggie to help straighten Brick out so he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) can take over the place. Gooper protests and says he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has always resented Daddy's love for Brick. Gooper and Mae present Mama with a drafted will and Mama rejects it in disgust. Mama embraces the distant Brick, begging him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to provide Big Daddy with a grandson before he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dies. Suddenly Maggie announces that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and Brick are to have a child. Sobbing, Mama flees jubilantly to tell Big Daddy. Mae accuses Maggie of lying. Maggie thanks Brick for saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face. Brick puts down three shots, finds his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) click, and exits indifferently. Maggie forlornly gathers Brick's liquor bottles and locks them away, refusing to release it until he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has sated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Desperately she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) declares her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). The distant Brick can only reply: <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't it be funny if that was true?''
