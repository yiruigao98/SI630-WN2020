In April, the spring thaw begins and the first golfers brave the course. Unlike the dismal spring, the autumn and winter empower Dexter and stimulate his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) imagination. Dexter imagines beating the golf club's most esteemed members. At work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) crosses paths with Judy Jones, who, attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) nurse, asks Dexter to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) clubs. Dexter can't leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) post, and Judy throws a tantrum and tries to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) nurse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) clubs. When the caddy-master promptly returns and Dexter is free to be Judy's caddy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) quits. Hastily ending his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) employment as a caddie is the first in a lifelong series of impetuous acts that would be dictated to Dexter by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) so-called winter dreams, which drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) to desire material success. Dexter foregoes state school for a more esteemed eastern university, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) financial resources are stretched. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) still longs for luxury, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) desires are often denied. After college, Dexter, articulate and confident, borrows $1,000 off the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) degree and buys a partnership in a laundry. By age twenty-seven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) owns the largest chain of laundries in the upper Midwest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) sells the business and moves to New York. We learn more about a period of time during Dexter's rise to success. At age twenty-three, Dexter is given a weekend pass to the Sherry Island Golf Club by Mr. Hart, for whom Dexter used to caddy. Dexter feels superior to the other competitors but also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) does not belong in this world. At the fifteenth green, while the group searches for a lost ball, Mr. Hedrick is struck in the stomach by Miss Jones, who wishes to play through and doesn't realize that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) has struck another player. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hits her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) ball and continues on, as the men alternately praise or criticize her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) beauty and forward behavior. Later that evening, Dexter swims out to the raft in the club's lake, stretching out on the springboard and listening to a distant piano. The sound of the tune fills him (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) with delight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) present situation. The peaceful scene is disturbed by the roar of Judy's motorboat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) has abandoned a date who believes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) ideal, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) asks Dexter to drive the boat so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) can water-ski. Waiting for Judy to arrive for their date the next evening, Dexter imagines all the successful men from esteemed backgrounds who had once loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) has acquired polish and sophistication despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) humble origins. Judy arrives in modest clothes, tells the maid that dinner can be served, and informs Dexter that her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) parents will not be in attendance, which is a relief for Dexter. After dinner, on the sun porch, Judy asks Dexter whether it is all right if she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) cries. A man she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) was dating has confessed he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) is poor. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) asks Dexter what his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) financial standing is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) is most likely the richest young man in the entire region. They kiss, and Dexter's passion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) increases. Dexter continues his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) pursuit of Judy, but during a picnic she (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) leaves with another man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) claims that nothing has happened between her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) and the other man, which Dexter doesn't believe. Judy toys with the various men who seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) affections. The summer ends, and Dexter takes up residence at a club in town, showing up at the dances when Judy is in attendance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) still desires her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) and dreams of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) to New York to live. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) eventually forces himself to accept the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) will never possess her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) wants. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) throws himself into work and becomes engaged to Irene. One night, just before the engagement is to be announced, Irene's headache forces her (<font color='blue'><b>Irene</b></font>) to cancel her (<font color='blue'><b>Irene</b></font>) plans with Dexter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) return to the University Club, where Judy, back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) travels, approaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>). They go for a drive. Judy flirts with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>), telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) should marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>), and they discuss their former passion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) asks to be taken home and begins to cry quietly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) repeats her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) desire to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) relents. Later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) does not regret that Judy's ardor cools after a month, that Irene and her (<font color='blue'><b>Irene</b></font>) family were deeply hurt by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) betrayal, or that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) reputation in the city has been compromised. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) loves Judy above all. Leaving for the East with the intention of selling his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) laundries and settling in New York, the outbreak of World War I calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) back west, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) transfers management of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) business to a partner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) enters basic training, welcoming the distraction of combat. In New York seven years later, when Dexter is thirty-two, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) is more successful than ever. Devlin, a business associate, informs Dexter that Judy married a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>), a man who cheats on her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) and drinks heavily while Judy stays at home with the children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) has also, according to Devlin, lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) looks. Dexter feels the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Judy</b></font>) beauty and spark personally, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) illusions of Judy are finally and irreparably shattered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) cries, mourning the past and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) lost youth, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dexter</b></font>) will never be able to reclaim.
