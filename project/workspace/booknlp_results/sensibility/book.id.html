Mrs. Dashwood and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters -LRB-Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret-RRB- are invited to stay with their distant relations, the Middletons, at Barton Park. Elinor is sad to leave their home at Norland because she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) has become closely attached to Edward Ferrars, the brother-in-law of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) half-brother John. However, once at Barton Park, Elinor and Marianne discover many new acquaintances, including the retired officer and bachelor Colonel Brandon, and the gallant and impetuous John Willoughby, who rescues Marianne after she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) twists her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ankle running down the hills of Barton in the rain. Willoughby openly and unabashedly courts Marianne, and together the two flaunt their attachment to one another, until Willoughby suddenly announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) must depart for London on business, leaving Marianne lovesick and miserable. Meanwhile, Anne and Lucy Steele, two recently discovered relations of Lady Middleton's mother, Mrs. Jennings, arrive at Barton Park as guests of the Middletons. Lucy ingratiates herself to Elinor and informs her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) -LRB-Lucy-RRB- has been secretly engaged to Mr. Ferrars for a whole year. Elinor initially assumes that Lucy is referring to Edward's younger brother, Robert, but is shocked and pained to learn that Lucy is actually referring to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own beloved Edward. In Volume II of the novel, Elinor and Marianne travel to London with Mrs. Jennings. Colonel Brandon informs Elinor that everyone in London is talking of an engagement between Willoughby and Marianne, though Marianne has not told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) family of any such attachment. Marianne is anxious to be reunited with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) beloved Willoughby, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sees him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) at a party in town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) cruelly rebuffs her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) and then sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a letter denying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) ever had feelings for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). Colonel Brandon tells Elinor of Willoughby's history of callousness and debauchery, and Mrs. Jennings confirms that Willoughby, having squandered his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) fortune, has become engaged to the wealthy heiress Miss Grey. In Volume III, Lucy's older sister inadvertently reveals the news of Lucy's secret engagement to Edward Ferrars. Edward's mother is outraged at the information and disinherits him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), promising his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fortune to Robert instead. Meanwhile, the Dashwood sisters visit family friends at Cleveland on their way home from London. At Cleveland, Marianne develops a severe cold while taking long walks in the rain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) falls deathly ill. Upon hearing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) illness, Willoughby comes to visit, attempting to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) misconduct and seek forgiveness. Elinor pities him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) and ultimately shares his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) story with Marianne, who finally realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) behaved imprudently with Willoughby and could never have been happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) anyway. Mrs. Dashwood and Colonel Brandon arrive at Cleveland and are relieved to learn that Marianne has begun to recover. When the Dashwoods return to Barton, they learn from their manservant that Lucy Steele and Mr. Ferrars are engaged. They assume that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) means Edward Ferrars, and are thus unsurprised, but Edward himself soon arrives and corrects their misconception: it was Robert, not himself, whom the money-grubbing Lucy ultimately decided to marry. Thus,x Edward is finally free to propose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) beloved Elinor, and not long after, Marianne and Colonel Brandon become engaged as well. The couples live together at Delaford and remain in close touch with their mother and younger sister at Barton Cottage.
