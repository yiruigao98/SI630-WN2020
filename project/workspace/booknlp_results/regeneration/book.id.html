The letter has been published in the London Times and has received much attention in England, as many people are upset over the length and toll of the war thus far. The army is not sure what to do with Sassoon, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) letter clearly threatens to undermine the strength of the war effort at home. With the string-pulling and guidance of Robert Graves, a fellow poet and friend of Sassoon, the Board agrees to send Sassoon to Craiglockhart War Hospital--a mental facility in Scotland--rather than court-marshaling him (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>). Sassoon is at first hesitant to agree to this, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) -LRB-rightly-RRB- fears that being committed to a mental hospital will undermine his (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) cause; however, convinced by Graves that there is no other option, Sassoon agrees. At Craiglockhart, Sassoon meets with Dr. W.H.R. Rivers, a former anthropologist turned psychiatrist who encourages his (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) patients to express their war memories so that they can heal their <div class="bookquote">``nerves.''  (<font color='red'><b>patients</b></font>)</div>Though Rivers can sympathize with the strong dislike of the horrors of war, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) believes it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) duty to encourage Sassoon to return to France to fight. There are many soldiers with various problems and ailments in the hospital. Burns, an emaciated man, has been unable to eat since a shell threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) into the gas-filled stomach of a German corpse. Anderson, a former war surgeon, is now terrified at the sight of blood, and is worried about resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) civilian medical practice. Prior, a young, stubborn, and slightly difficult patient, enters the hospital suffering from mutism. Rivers meets with each of them in turn, helping them to recover from their problems. One stormy night, Burns leaves the hospital, makes a trip far into the countryside, and comes across a tree with dead animals hanging from it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) is at first frightened, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) then starts removing the animals from the branches one by one and arranging them in a circle. Burns lies down in the middle of the circle, naked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) feels soothed. Eventually, Burns returns to the hospital, but no one finds out about this episode. Dr. Rivers is personally and emotionally tied to the welfare of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) patients. One night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) has a nightmare about old nerve regeneration experiments he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) used to conduct with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) old friend, Henry Head. At Cambridge, the two had severed a nerve in Head's hand with the purpose of charting its gradual regeneration. Rivers still feels guilty about the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) inflicted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) friend, as well as the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) inflicts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) patients by forcing them to talk about their war experiences. Sassoon's letter is read in the House of Commons and is dismissed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) is considered mentally unstable. Though Sassoon expected this result, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) is still saddened and disappointed by the news. Slowly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) begins to become friends with another patient in the hospital, Wilfred Owen. Owen is also a poet and he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) greatly respects Sassoon's work; Sassoon agrees to help Owen with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) poetry. Prior, who has regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) voice, finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) way to a pub in Edinburgh where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) meets a young munitions worker named Sarah Lumb. They strike up an acquaintance and agree to see each other again. When Prior returns to the hospital, Rivers tries hypnosis on Prior to see if it enables him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) to remember the tragic events that led to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) breakdown. The hypnosis works, and Prior remembers in vivid detail having to shovel his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) men's remains after they were killed by a shell. Prior's memories anger and upset him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>). The next week, Prior takes Sarah to a seaside town where they see crowds of people walking on the beach. Prior envies and resents the way these people can just escape from the war. A storm comes, and Prior and Sarah make love under the shelter of a thornbush. After a very busy day, Rivers wakes up in the middle of the night with chest pain; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) doctor insists that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) take three weeks vacation. During these three weeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) visits his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) brother's house and reflects on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) relationship with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) deceased father. Rivers then visits his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) old friend Henry Head, who offers him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) a terrific job at a war hospital in London. Finally Rivers visits Burns's house in Suffolk for a few days. The Review Board has given Burns an unconditional discharge from the army. While at Suffolk, Burns has an episode and tries to commit suicide by hiding in a hole that floods at high tide. Rivers finds Burns, however, and saves him (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>). Back at Craiglockhart, the Board has granted Prior permanent home service; he (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) will not have to return to the war. Prior sneaks into Sarah's room and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) the news. Though they are both skeptical about love, they agree to give their relationship a try. Meanwhile, Sassoon has also come to a very important decision. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) still disagrees with the brutality and suffering of the war, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) decides to return to France in order to care for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sassoon</b></font>) men. Both Graves and Rivers are pleased with this decision. Dr. Rivers decides to take the job in London, and leaves Craiglockhart in glory -LRB-Willard, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) patients, has overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) mental block and is now able to walk again-RRB-. In London, Rivers is fascinated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) new work. Dr. Yealland, another psychiatrist specializing in war patients, invites Rivers to the National Hospital to come on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) rounds. Rivers watches one of Yealland's horrific electro-shock therapy sessions on a patient named Callan. That night, Rivers has a nightmare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) is shoving a horse's bit into Sassoon's mouth, similar to the way Yealland shoved the electrode into the patient's mouth. Rivers returns to Craiglockhart for a monthly Review Board meeting. The Board grants Anderson a desk position in the War Office and discharges Sassoon to duty, to return to France to fight. As Rivers says farewell to Sassoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) realizes how much his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) own views about the war have changed.
