Perry, a black high school graduate from Harlem, travels to Vietnam
to fight in the United States Army. When Richie leaves basic training
for Vietnam, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) harbors a host of illusions about the war and the
army. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) confidently believes that the medical profile he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) has received
for a knee injury will be properly processed and prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) from
engaging in combat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) also believes in the flurry of rumors about
imminent peace and in the prevalent romantic myths about warfare. When Richie first arrives in Vietnam, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) befriends Harold
<div class="bookquote">``Peewee''  (<font color='red'><b>Harold</b></font>)</div>Gates and Jenkins, two new recruits assigned to the same squad.
A sergeant assures them that they should encounter only easy, light
work, as there is not much fighting near Chu Lai, where their company
is stationed. These rumors prove to be wishful thinking, however,
when the three new soldiers arrive at their camp; Jenkins is killed
by a land mine during the squad's first patrol. Richie is deeply
shaken and longs to communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) terror and horror to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) family,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) finds himself unable to write the truth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) mother and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) brother, Kenny. As Richie witnesses ever-increasing levels of destruction
and brutality, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) begins to doubt whether there is any straightforward morality
in war. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) sees that the line between good and bad is often ambiguous.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) also becomes disillusioned with the selfishness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) commanding
officers, particularly the company commander, Captain Stewart, who
is more concerned with earning a promotion than he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is with the safety
of the soldiers under his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) command. When Richie's platoon leader,
Lieutenant Carroll, is killed during a combat mission, Richie begins
a serious search for answers to why he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) fellow soldiers are
even fighting in Vietnam in the first place. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) friends
insist that such thoughts are futile and dangerous, Richie feels
compelled to find meaning within the chaos. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) also longs for some
way to communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) confused thoughts and emotions to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) family,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) remains unable to do so. Richie is not sure how to sort out
the emotions he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) feels or how to communicate them effectively to
civilians who have never seen combat. As Richie searches for meaning in the war, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) also searches
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) own sense of self. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) struggles to unravel his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) motivations
for enlisting in the army, wondering whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) reason was a selfless
one, based on the desire to earn money to provide for Kenny, or
a selfish one--simply to escape from the hard life he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenny</b></font>) faced in Harlem.
Richie also forces himself to confront the uncomfortable question
of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) will do when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) returns to civilian life. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) is
highly intelligent and highly motivated and has ambitions to become
a writer, his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) family is too poor to send him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) to college. Richie's
father abandoned the family years ago, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) mother has since
become an alcoholic. Richie is afraid that without an education
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) has no career potential, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) is unsure what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) has to look
forward to if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) survives. Richie is wounded in a battle and transferred to a hospital.
During the peaceful weeks spent recuperating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) begins to remember the
joys of safety and gains a new sense of the horrors of war. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>)
is declared healthy and ordered to rejoin his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) unit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) wonders how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) can possibly go back into combat and considers deserting the
army. In the end, though, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) rejoins his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) unit as ordered. Back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) unit, Richie learns that the old squad leader,
Sergeant Simpson, has been sent home. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) replacement is the racist Sergeant
Dongan, who always places black soldiers in the most dangerous positions.
Early in their tour of duty, there are racial and ethnic tensions
among the squad members, which frequently result in physical confrontations.
As the squad's bond grows stronger, however, petty prejudices begin
to fade, and the squad bands together against Dongan's racism. Soon,
Dongan is killed, and the squad is placed under the command of one
of its own soldiers, Corporal Brunner. Brunner leads the men on a deadly mission to track down
a group of Vietcong--North Vietnamese guerilla forces--along a river. After
a series of mistakes and miscalculations, a firefight breaks out, leaving
both Richie and Peewee wounded. Richie's medical profile is finally
processed while he (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) is recovering, and Peewee's wounds are serious
enough to earn him (<font color='blue'><b>Richie</b></font>) a discharge from the army. Peewee and Richie
fly home on the same plane, along with caskets containing dead soldiers.
They try to stand tall for the new recruits, who are just arriving
in Vietnam.
