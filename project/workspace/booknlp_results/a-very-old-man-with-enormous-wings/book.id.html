The old man is filthy and apparently senile, and speaks an unintelligible language. After consulting a neighbor woman, Pelayo and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pelayo</b></font>) wife, Elisenda, conclude that the old man must be an angel who had tried to come and take their sick child to heaven. The neighbor woman tells Pelayo that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pelayo</b></font>) should club the angel to death, but Pelayo and Elisenda take pity on their visitor, especially after their child recovers. Pelayo and Elisenda keep the old man in their chicken coop, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pelayo</b></font>) soon begins to attract crowds of curious visitors. Father Gonzaga, the local priest, tells the people that the old man is probably not an angel because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s shabby and doesn't speak Latin. Father Gonzaga decides to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) bishop for guidance. Despite Father Gonzaga's efforts, word of the old man's existence soon spreads, and pilgrims come from all over to seek advice and healing from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). One woman comes because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d been counting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heartbeats since childhood and couldn't continue counting. An insomniac visits because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) claims that the stars in the night sky are too noisy. The crowd eventually grows so large and disorderly with the sick and curious that Elisenda begins to charge admission. For the most part, the old man ignores the people, even when they pluck his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feathers and throw stones at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stand up. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) becomes enraged, however, when the visitors sear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a branding iron to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s still alive. Father Gonzaga does his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) best to restrain the crowd, even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) waits for the Church's opinion on the old man. The crowd starts to disperse when a traveling freak show arrives in the village. People flock to hear the story of the so-called spider woman, a woman who'd been transformed into a giant tarantula with the head of a woman after she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d disobeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) parents. The sad tale of the spider woman is so popular that people quickly forget the old man, who'd performed only a few pointless semimiracles for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pilgrims. Pelayo and Elisenda have nevertheless grown quite wealthy from the admission fees Elisenda had charged. Pelayo quits his (<font color='blue'><b>Pelayo</b></font>) job and builds a new, larger house. The old man continues to stay with them, still in the chicken coop, for several years, as the little boy grows older. When the chicken coop eventually collapses, the old man moves into the adjacent shed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) often wanders from room to room inside the house, much to Elisenda's annoyance. Just when Pelayo and Elisenda are convinced that the old man will soon die, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begins to regain his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feathers grow back and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begins to sing sea chanteys -LRB-sailors' songs-RRB- to himself at night. One day the old man stretches his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wings and takes off into the air, and Elisenda watches him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disappear over the horizon.
