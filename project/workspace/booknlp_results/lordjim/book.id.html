Jim is a promising young man who goes to sea as a youth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) rises quickly through the ranks and soon becomes chief mate. Raised on popular sea literature, Jim constantly daydreams about becoming a hero, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) has never faced any real danger. Finally, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) chance comes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) is serving aboard a vessel called the Patna, carrying Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, when the ship strikes an underwater object and springs a leak. With a storm approaching, the crew abandons her (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) passengers to their fate. Jim, not thinking clearly, abandons the ship with the rest of the crew. The Patna does not sink, however, and Jim, along with the rest of the officers, is subjected to an official inquiry by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) fellow seamen. It is at this inquiry, where Jim is stripped of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) officer's certification, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) first meets Marlow. Seeing something in Jim that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) recognizes, or perhaps fears, in himself, Marlow strikes up a tortured friendship with Jim. Jim tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) story, and Marlow helps him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) obtain a series of jobs. The Patna incident haunts him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), though; each time it is mentioned, Jim flees his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) current situation, enlisting Marlow's help once again. Finally, with the help of Stein, an expatriate trader, Marlow gets Jim situated as post manager in the remote territory of Patusan. Jim is initially captured by one of the warring factions of the area, but soon escapes and finally becomes a hero by defeating a local bandit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) falls in love with Jewel, the beautiful, half-native stepdaughter of the previous trading post manager, a bitter little man called Cornelius. Jim becomes the spiritual leader of Patusan. Its citizens place their trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) and rely on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to enforce justice. One day, Gentleman Brown, a pirate, shows up in Patusan with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) crew in search of provisions. A skirmish ensues, and Brown holes up atop a hill. Cornelius, annoyed by Jim's success and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) own failures, secretly meets with Brown and a conspiracy, including a dissenting Patusan faction, is formed against Jim. Jim, unaware of the plot, agrees to let Brown leave the area peacefully -LRB-Brown guesses at Jim's dishonorable past, and Jim decides it would be still more dishonorable to kill Brown simply because Brown knows the truth about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)-RRB-. Cornelius guides Brown down an alternate river channel, which leads him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) to the camp of Dain Waris, the son of Jim's closest ally, Doramin. Brown and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) men ambush the camp, killing Dain Waris. Jim, realizing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) has still not been able to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) initial failure aboard the Patna, ignores Jewel's pleas and goes to Doramin's compound, where the grieving father shoots and kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). Much of the novel is concerned with Marlow's attempts to piece together Jim's story from a variety of sources. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) recounts the story to a group of acquaintances. At this point in time, though, Brown has not yet come to Patusan, and the story remains unfinished. Once events are completed, Marlow writes them down in manuscript form, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) then sends to a member of the audience of the first part of the story. The novel fragments time, and Marlow juxtaposes different, non-chronological pieces of Jim's story for maximum effect, all the while seeking to discover the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) own fascination with Jim and the meaning behind the story.
