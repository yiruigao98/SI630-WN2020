It is late July, and Abel stays with his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) grandfather Francisco, who is a farmer. Abel meets a young white woman named Angela through the town priest, Father Olguin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) chops wood for her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) and they eventually have an affair. Abel's return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) home brings up many different memories for him (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>), about his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) brother, mother, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) membership in the Eagle Watchers Society. Father Olguin is also highly cognizant of memory, obsessed with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Olguin</b></font>) predecessors at the mission. Father Olguin also eventually develops another interest, Angela. He (<font color='blue'><b>Olguin</b></font>) stops in her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) house the same day that Abel chopped wood for her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>), and invites her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) to the town's feast of Santiago. During a contest that reenacts a historical event in the life of Santiago, Angela witnesses a brilliant horseman, an albino, ceremonially smear Abel with the blood of a rooster. In the beginning of August there is a festival and a large storm. A bull runs through the streets, chased by the townspeople people, and Francisco engages in a ceremony with many of the other elders. That night, after drinking at the bar, Abel seemingly inexplicably kills the albino man with a knife. Seven years later, Abel is released from prison and placed under the care of an Indian Relocation program in Los Angeles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) begins to work at a factory where he (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) meets Ben Benally, who offers to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) apartment with Abel. -LRB-Many of these details unfold out of chronological order, only pieced together in the last several chapters.-RRB- Much of the section <div class="bookquote">``The Priest of the Sun'' (<font color='red'><b>Abel</b></font>)</div>, the first portion of the novel set in Los Angeles, is written from the point of view of Abel. The present moment of the chapter is a night when Abel has just been beaten up by unknown assailants and left almost dead on the beach. One of the poignant threads to Abel's past resurfaces in this section--his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) memory of Milly, a social worker, who would come around to the apartment and spend time with Abel and Ben. Eventually, Abel gets to know Milly socially and they become lovers. In contrast with Abel's daily existence are the sermons that the Priest of the Sun, John Big Bluff Tosamah, delivers in this same section of the novel, the last weekend of January 1952. The sermons contain several stories of the Kiowa people, such as how the Kiowa came to be and how the Big Dipper was formed in the sky. Tosamah also delivers a sermon that gives the history of the last days of the Kiowa as a sun dance culture, titled <div class="bookquote">``The Way to Rainy Mountain.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Kiowa</b></font>)</div>At the end of the sermon, Tosamah tells of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own experience visiting the grave of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) grandmother at the base of Rainy Mountain. The next section of the novel, set in February of that same year, is told from the point of view of Ben Benally on the day that Abel leaves for Walatowa. At the hospital and during a ceremony with the Priest of the Sun, both Ben and Abel make a pact to meet some day to sing the ceremonial song <div class="bookquote">``House Made of Dawn.''  (<font color='red'><b>Abel</b></font>)</div>Ben recounts the events leading up to Abel's disappearance: working at the factory, drinking, more drinking, an altercation at Tosamah's, the visits of Milly, and a trip to the beach one afternoon. By that point of the trip to the beach, Abel has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) job and spends most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) time at the bars. One night, Ben and Abel are mugged when they are returning home from the bar. A week later, Abel's alcoholism leads to further aggression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) part towards Ben, who refuses to take Abel's behavior any more. The two men have a fight and Abel leaves, not returning until three days later, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) shows up at the apartment badly beaten and seemingly near death. It is never revealed what has happened to Abel during these three days of absence: all we can surmise from the previous chapter is that Abel is badly beaten by a group of men and left on the beach. Not long after his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) beating, Abel returns to Walatowa, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) grandfather, Francisco, on the verge of dying. Francisco remembers the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) became a man, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) first bear hunt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) also remembers taking Abel to the place where the race of the dead took place each year, at the old wagon road near town. That night, Francisco passes away and Abel prepares him (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) and leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) with Father Olguin before dawn. Abel then quickly goes to the old wagon road until he (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) approaches the field where the race of the dead used to take place. As the first light of dawn strikes the slopes of the valley, Abel watches the runners whip by him (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) follows, regardless of his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) body's pain, and runs after them.
