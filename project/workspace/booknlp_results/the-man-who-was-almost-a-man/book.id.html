He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) vows to someday own a gun and get the respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) deserves, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) wants to prove to the others that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) is no longer a child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) decides to head to the local store to examine the guns offered in a mail-order catalog, hoping that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) mother will let him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) buy a pistol with the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) earns working in Mr. Hawkins's fields. Entering the store, Dave feels his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) confidence drain from him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) sees Joe, the shopkeeper, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) manages to convince Joe to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) the catalog overnight. Joe is surprised that Dave is thinking of buying a gun, especially because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) knows that Dave's mother saves all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) summer earnings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) nevertheless offers to sell Dave an old pistol he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) has on hand for $2. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) interest piqued, Dave says he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) will come back for it later. At home, Mrs. Saunders chides Dave for being late, and Dave tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) was visiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) friends. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) way out to wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) hands, Mrs. Saunders notices the catalog and seizes it, giving it back when Dave explains he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) has to return it the next day. During supper, Dave is too engrossed in the catalog to eat or notice the arrival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) father and younger brother. Admiring the revolvers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) chokes down his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) dinner, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) should ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) mother for the money instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) father. Dave finally works up enough courage after dinner to broach the subject, first asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) mother whether Mr. Hawkins has paid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) time working in the fields. Mrs. Saunders responds that the money is solely for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) school clothes and immediately dismisses the idea of buying a gun. Dave pleads his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) case, arguing that the family needs a gun and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>)'ll give it to Mr. Saunders. Still not fully convinced, Mrs. Saunders finally gives Dave the $2 on the condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) bring the gun directly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) after buying it. After buying the pistol, Dave walks around the fields with it, admiring the gun but too scared and unsure of how to fire it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) waits until it's dark and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>)'s sure everyone has already fallen asleep before going home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) puts the gun underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) pillow instead of giving it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) mother as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>)'d promised. Mrs. Saunders approaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) in the middle of the night and quietly asks for the gun, but Dave tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) stashed it outside and will give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) in the morning. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) wakes up, Dave removes the gun and holds it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) hands, realizing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) now has the power to kill someone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) quietly gets out of bed and ties the pistol to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) leg with an old strip of flannel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) then heads out to the fields where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) works, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) accidentally runs into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) boss, Mr. Hawkins. Surprised but not wanting to give away his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) secret, Dave tells Mr. Hawkins that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) just wanted to get a head start on the day's work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) hitches the plow to a mule named Jenny and heads to the field farthest away so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) can fire the pistol without anyone noticing. After holding and admiring the gun, Dave finally works up the courage to actually pull the trigger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) doesn't take proper aim, however, and accidentally shoots Jenny. Dave panics and desperately tries to stop the bleeding by plugging the wound with dirt, but Jenny soon dies. Sickened and frightened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) buries the gun at the base of tree and heads across the field, trying to concoct a believable story to explain Jenny's death to Mr. Hawkins. Someone eventually finds Jenny, and a small group gathers around her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) body. When pressed, Dave lies and says that Jenny had been startled and fell on the point of the plow. Unconvinced, Mrs. Saunders urges him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) to tell the truth and then quietly asks about the gun when no one else is listening. Meanwhile, someone comments that Jenny's wound looks like a bullet hole. Crying and realizing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) has to tell the truth, Dave confesses. Mr. Saunders is shocked to hear about the pistol and Mrs. Saunders's complicity. Mr. Hawkins tells Dave that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>)'ll have to pay $50 for the mule even though her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) death had been an accident. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) then tells Mr. Saunders that he (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>)'ll take $2 out of Dave's pay each month until the debt has been paid. When Mr. Saunders asks Dave where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) put the gun, however, Dave lies again and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) threw it into the creek. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) father tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) to retrieve it, get his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) $2 back from Joe, and give them to Mr. Hawkins as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) first payment. Unable to sleep that night, Dave skulks out to retrieve the gun. Cleaning it off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) forces himself to shoot it without closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) eyes and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) head away as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>)'d done before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) fires the gun four times until there are no more bullets left. Putting the gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) heads across the field until he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) comes to Mr. Hawkins's large white house. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had one more bullet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) muses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) would fire at the house to let Mr. Hawkins know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) is really a man. Dave then hears the sound of a train in the distance. Gun in hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) heads for the tracks and hops into a moving boxcar as the train continues on into the night.
