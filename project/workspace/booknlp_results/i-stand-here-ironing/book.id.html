The mother likens the back-and-forth motion of the iron to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own mental process as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) considers the cautionary statement made by this outside party. The person has asked the narrator to help him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) understand the narrator's daughter, Emily, a young woman whom the person claims is in need of assistance. The narrator balks, wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can possibly do to change the situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) believes that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has no special insight into Emily's behavior simply because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother. The narrator feels she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would become mired in the abstractions of the situation, all the things she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should have done or those things that cannot be altered. The narrator remembers how beautiful Emily was as a baby, then her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) awkward phase, followed by the blossoming of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) beauty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) late teens. The narrator states that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) breast-fed Emily, then questions why she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) cites that fact first in pleading her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) case to the unnamed <div class="bookquote">``you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When Emily was eight months old, the narrator was forced to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) in the care of a neighbor. Emily's father had left unexpectedly, unable to bear the family's poverty. The narrator recalls running home from work to retrieve Emily, who always cried when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) spotted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>). Eventually, the narrator sent Emily to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) father's family. Emily returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) mother's care when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was two, but the narrator worked long hours and placed Emily in day care. The narrator is still angry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) had no other choice. Emily would find any excuse to stay home from nursery school with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) mother. The narrator recalls an old neighbor gently telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) should smile more at Emily. The narrator was more joyful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) other four children and fears she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) is responsible for Emily's somber nature. Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) restrained temperament, Emily displays a talent for comedy and acting. The mother recalls sending Emily away to another's care a second time and Emily's subsequent return, this time adjusting to a new stepfather. The narrator and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) second husband often left Emily alone for hours. Emily was sick with the measles when the narrator went to the hospital to have another daughter, Susan. The illness left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) thin, weak, and prone to nightmares. The narrator tries to comfort Emily now, in the present, but it is too late. Suffering from tuberculosis at another point in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) life, Emily was sent to a convalescent home, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) could be better cared for. During twice-monthly visits, the narrator had to shout to Emily, who stood on a balcony some distance away, because all the parents were forbidden from getting too close to their children. Emily returned home frail, distant, and rigid, with little appetite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) disliked the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) looked and had few friends and little luck attracting boys' attention. The family moved frequently, and Emily's feigned illnesses meant she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was often absent from school, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was labeled a <div class="bookquote">``slow learner.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>In rare peaceful moments, Emily and Susan played together. Otherwise, the girls were at odds. Susan would retell one of Emily's jokes in front of company to the praise and admiration of all. Emily's physical development as a teenager was slow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) self-esteem issues deepened. The crying of the narrator's infant son, Ronnie, interrupts her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) reverie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) cradles the child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) resumes her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) examination of Emily's life, serving as mother to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) four younger siblings during and after World War II and helping to get the chaotic brood off to school, where Emily was lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) classes. Good at imitations and comic performances, Emily, with the narrator's encouragement, entered and won the school talent show. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) tearfully phoned the narrator at work to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) the news. Emily began performing widely, blossoming into a talented performer. But without the money and encouragement to develop her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) talent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) potential remained unfulfilled. In the story's present moment, Emily returns home and fixes herself something to eat. The narrator assures the person she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) is addressing that Emily will be fine just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) is. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) then lists the multiple reasons Emily had a rocky childhood and hopes that Emily will come to view herself as a valuable creation.
