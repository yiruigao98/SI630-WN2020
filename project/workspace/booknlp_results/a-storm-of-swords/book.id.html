The novel describes the increasingly vicious War of Five Kings in Westeros, Daenerys's strengthening forces in the East, and the oncoming threat of the Others, a ghostly army that is nearly invincible. The story is told from the perspective of 12 different characters, though 10 tell the majority of the story. Their tales occur simultaneously, as the chapters cycle among their perspective, though here they are recounted one at a time. The novel opens with a prologue. Chett, a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, has decided to murder his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) superiors and desert his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) post. But before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) can carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) plan, a vast army attacks the Wall, a massive structure designed to repel northern invaders. Chett fears that the invasion may be successful, for the first time in generations. In the city of King's Landing, Tyrion Lannister recuperates. At the end of the previous novel, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was involved in a massive battle in which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) showed great courage and was seriously wounded. As he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) recovers, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) tries to win the favor he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) feels his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) family owes him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), but to little effect. His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) father, Tywin, continues to disparage him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sister, Cersei, despises him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) as much as ever. Tyrion does little to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) disapproval of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) family and the reign of King Joffrey, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) nephew. Meanwhile, Tyrion has been carrying on a secret relationship with Shae, a prostitute he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) has disguised as a castle maid. The relationship becomes complicated when Tyrion, for political reasons and much against his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will, is married to 13-year-old Sansa Stark. Tyrion refuses to consummate the marriage with the terrified young Sansa, who for some time has been a hostage to the Lannisters and subjected to endless mistreatment. During this time, King Joffrey has been engaged to marry Margaery Tyrell in order to create an alliance between their two houses. But on the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyrell</b></font>) wedding, Joffrey is poisoned, and Tyrion is immediately accused of the crime. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyrell</b></font>) chooses trial by combat, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyrell</b></font>) champion is killed, condemning Tyrion to death. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyrell</b></font>) waits in jail, Shae quickly forgets him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyrell</b></font>). Then, just before his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyrell</b></font>) execution, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyrell</b></font>) recently returned brother, Jaime, rescues him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyrell</b></font>). Jaime admits to having lied to Tyrion in the past about a woman that Tyrion once married, but who Tywin in disapproval had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) soldiers rape to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) off. Jaime told Tyrion at the time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a prostitute he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) had paid to sleep with Tyrion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) now reveals to Tyrion that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was just a crofter's daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marriage to Tyrion wasn't purchased. Tyrion is furious and swears revenge. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) flees for good, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) gains access to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) father's room via a secret passageway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) finds Shae there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) strangles her (<font color='blue'><b>Shae</b></font>) first, then discovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) father in the bathroom, kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) with a crossbow. Sansa is also suspected of having been involved in Joffrey's murder. In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shae</b></font>) had been planning to escape with the help of a knight whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Shae</b></font>) had once saved from Joffrey's wrath. On the night of Joffrey's wedding, immediately after Joffrey is killed, the knight takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Shae</b></font>) out to a waiting ship. Sansa is shocked to find on board the devious and charismatic Petyr Baelish, who reveals that the poison was smuggled into the wedding feast in Sansa's hairnet. They escape to the castle Baelish shares with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wife, Lysa, who is also Sansa's aunt. There, Sansa is betrothed to the sickly young Robert, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own cousin. One day, as Sansa builds a snow castle during a snowstorm, Baelish tries to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). Lysa becomes suspicious, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) angrily confronts Baelish, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) murders her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). But with Sansa's help, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sansa</b></font>) is able to convince everyone her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) death was an accident. Arya Stark, having escaped capture by the Lannisters, is trying to get to Riverrun, but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is soon taken captive by a band of outlaws. When they capture Sandor Clegane, a vicious former henchman of the Lannisters called the Hound, Arya wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) killed, but after winning a trial by combat, the Hound is freed. Arya runs away from the group, but the Hound finds and kidnaps her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), taking her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>). They travel to a fortress called the Twins, where Arya's brother Robb will be married, but they arrive just as assassins kill Robb and slaughter his (<font color='blue'><b>Robb</b></font>) court. The Hound takes Arya to an inn. It's his (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) rendezvous point with the Tickler and Polliver, men Arya encountered in the previous novel and also wants dead. In a drunken quarrel, the Hound kills the two men but is critically wounded himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) begs Arya to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) abandons him (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) to die. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) rides to Saltpans, a seaside town, where she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) boards a ship for the city of Braavos. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) ship having sunk in the massive battle that concluded A Clash of Kings, Ser Davos Seaworth begins the novel stranded on a small island until a passing ship rescues him (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) arrives at Dragonstone, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) king, Stannis Baratheon, has made his (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) seat, Davos tries to kill Melisandre, a cunning priestess whom Davos blames for the disastrous battle that sunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) ship and killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) sons. Melisandre anticipates Davos's move and imprisons him (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>). Rather than execute him (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>), however, Stannis, with Melisandre's approval, makes Davos his (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Davos</b></font>)</div>or most trusted advisor. Davos remains skeptical of Melisandre, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) learns that Edric Storm will be sacrificed to the god R'hllor at Melisandre's bidding, Davos helps Edric escape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arya</b></font>) then convinces King Stannis to help the Night's Watch repel the northern invasion. Because she (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) released Ser Jaime Lannister, her (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) family's sworn enemy, without the permission of her (<font color='blue'><b>priestess</b></font>) son Robb, the King in the North, Lady Catelyn Stark is accused of treason. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) freed Jaime with the understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) would return her (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) daughters, Sansa and Arya, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>), so Robb forgives her (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Robb</b></font>) also reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robb</b></font>) married Jeyne Westerling, despite having promised to marry one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters in order to solidify an alliance between their families. Everyone knows it was a disastrous lapse in judgment. Robb tries to mend ties by marrying Catelyn's brother, Edmure, to Roslin, a Frey daughter. At Edmure's wedding, however, Frey assassins massacre the Stark court, including Robb and Catelyn, in what is infamously called the Red Wedding. Three days after her (<font color='blue'><b>Frey</b></font>) death, Catelyn reappears, horribly scarred, unable to speak, and seething for vengeance. Ser Jaime Lannister, meanwhile, is on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lannister</b></font>) way back to King's Landing after being released by Catelyn Stark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) is not entirely free; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) is shackled and escorted by Brienne of Tarth, a tough and extremely dutiful woman who promised to see Jaime safely home and bring Catelyn's daughters back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Jaime and Brienne come to respect one another despite being adversaries. Eventually Brienne and Jaime are recognized and abducted on the road, and one of the captors cuts off Jaime's sword hand. It is a tremendous blow to Jaime, who has shaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) whole life and identity around being a skilled swordfighter and knight. They are taken to the court of Lord Bolton, who releases Jaime to win favor with the Lannisters. As Jaime is leaving, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) sees Brienne fighting unarmed against a bear for the amusement of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) captors and rescues her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). When Jaime returns to the House of Lannister, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) is restored to the Kingsguard and has a dramatic change of heart about himself. Previously selfish and uninterested in honor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) now wishes to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) legacy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaime</b></font>) shows concern for Brienne and Sansa Stark, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) relationship with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) twin sister and lover Cersei falls apart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) betrays his (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) family by rescuing Tyrion from execution. Meanwhile, in the far north, Jon Snow, a bastard child of the Stark family and member of the Night's Watch, pretends to join the wildlings, or the free people who live north of The Wall. At the end of the previous novel, Jon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) commander were captured by the wildlings, and Jon was instructed to feign joining them to gather information. Jon becomes close with Mance Rayder, a former brother of the Night's Watch and leader of the wildlings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) learns that a horde of undead creatures called the Others has begun moving south, which is why the wildlings are heading toward The Wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) also starts a relationship with Ygritte, a wildling woman, and falls in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Eventually Jon escapes, and upon making it back to The Wall, reveals the wildlings' intention to invade. When the invasion comes, Jon bravely helps lead the defense, but a faction of the Watch with a personal grudge against him (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) accuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) of being a traitor and imprisons him (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) is told he (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) can only prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) loyalty by killing Mance Rayder, which is essentially a suicide mission. While the wildlings continue to siege The Wall, King Stannis arrives with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) forces and drives the wildlings off. Stannis has Jon freed and offers to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) the Lord of Winterfell, a title Jon could never have held because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) was a bastard. At the same time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) is chosen by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) brothers as the new Lord Commander of the Watch since the previous one has died, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) must decide whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) wants to rule over Winterfell or remain in the Watch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jon</b></font>) chooses the Night's Watch. When the book begins and Jon Snow is with the wildlings, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) friend Samwell Tarly is also north of The Wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) is on a ranging expedition with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) brothers in the Watch when their company is attacked by undead creatures referred to as the Others. The cowardly Sam manages to kill an Other with an obsidian blade and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) realizes they are vulnerable to obsidian and fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) and a small number of men survive the battle, and they go to Craster's Keep. While there, a mutiny breaks out and some men kill the Watch's Lord Commander, Mormont. Sam escapes with Gilly, whose newborn baby he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) has sworn to protect. They are chased by Others and are ultimately rescued by a mysterious undead man called Coldhands. When they return to The Wall and Castle Black, it is Sam who convinces the Night's Watch to elect Jon Snow as Lord Commander. Having escaped from Winterfell in the last novel, Bran Stark, meanwhile, is on the run with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) caretakers Hodor, Meera, and Jojen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) feels driven to head north to The Wall because of a recurring vision he (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) has. While they march, Bran, who is a warg, or skinchanger, spends more and more time inside the mind of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) wolf, Summer, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Stark</b></font>) supernatural abilities continue to grow stronger. Ultimately they arrive at The Wall and meet the mysterious Coldhands, who takes them through it via the ancient Black Gate. In the east, Daenerys Tagaryen needs to raise an army to invade Westeros and reclaim her (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) crown. Ser Jorah Mormont, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) guardian and advisor, tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) can buy a slave army in Slaver's Bay, a region where slavery is common that includes the cities of Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen. In Astapor, at Ser Jorah's behest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) purchases a massive troupe of Unsullied, eunuch slave warriors who are skilled and fearless fighters, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) is horrified by the way they are raised and trained. Immediately after buying them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) turns them against their former masters and has all the slaves in the city set free. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) new force then march on Yunkai, where the rulers, unable to contend with Daenerys's army, relinquish their slaves to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>). Lastly she (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) turns to Meereen, and as they approach the city they find the Meereenese have nailed a slave child to a post every mile along the road. The city has massive walls though, and there is no obvious way to take the city. While they are encamped in front of it, Daenerys learns that her (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) closest aides, Arstan Whitebeard and Ser Jorah Mormont, have lied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>). Whitebeard is actually Ser Baristan Selmy, a former knight of the Kingsguard who sought out Daenerys as the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. He (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) didn't reveal himself because before pledging himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) first wanted to make sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) wasn't mad, like some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) ancestors had been. Ser Jorah, on the other hand, had been selling information on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) to spies from Westeros, though he (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) stopped some time ago. Daenerys offers them a chance to redeem themselves by sneaking into Meereen through the sewers and opening the doors. They succeed and Daenerys's army takes the city. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) forgives Ser Barristan, but Ser Jorah's betrayful is too painful and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) banishes him (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>). Reports come back that a new ruler has taken over Astapor, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) is more brutal to the slaves than those who ruled before. Feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) can't abandon those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Meera</b></font>) freed, Daenerys decides to stay in Meereen and rule as queen.
