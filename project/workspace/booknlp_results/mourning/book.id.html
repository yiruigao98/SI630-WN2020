The master of the house, Brigadier-General Ezra Mannon, is soon to return from war. Lavinia, Ezra's severe daughter, has just come, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) mother Christine, from a trip to New York. Seth, the gardener, takes the anguished girl aside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) needs to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would-be beau, Captain Brant. Before Seth can continue, however, Lavinia's suitor Peter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sister Hazel, arrive. Lavinia stiffens. If Peter is proposing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) must realize that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) cannot marry anyone because Father needs her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>). Lavinia asks Seth to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Seth</b></font>) story. Seth asks if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) has not noticed that Brant looks just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) all the other male Mannons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) believes that Brant is the child of David Mannon and Marie Brant√¥me, a Canuck nurse, a couple expelled from the house for fear of public disgrace. Suddenly Brant himself enters from the drive. Calculatingly Lavinia derides the memory of Brant's mother. Brant explodes and reveals his (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) heritage. Lavinia's grandfather loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) mother and jealously cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) brother out of the family. Brant has sworn vengeance. A moment later, Lavinia appears inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) father's study. Christine enters indignantly, wondering why Lavinia has summoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>). Lavinia reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) to New York and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) kissing Brant. Christine defiantly tells Lavinia that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) has long hated Ezra and that Lavinia was born of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) disgust. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) brother Orin because he (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) always seemed hers alone. Lavinia coldly explains that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) intends to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) mother's secret for Ezra's sake. Christine must only promise to never see Brant again. Laughingly Christine accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) daughter of wanting Brant herself. Lavinia has always schemed to steal her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) place. Christine agrees to Lavinia's terms. Later she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) proposes to Brant that they poison Ezra and attribute his (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) death to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) heart trouble. One week later, Lavinia stands stiffly at the top of the front stairs with Christine. Suddenly Ezra enters and stops stiffly before his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) house. Lavinia rushes forward and embraces him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>). Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) and Ezra alone, Christine assures her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) has nothing to suspect with regards to Brant. Ezra impulsively kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) hand. The war has made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) realize that they must overcome the wall between them. Calculatingly Christine assures him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) that all is well. They kiss. Toward daybreak in Ezra's bedroom, Christine slips out from the bed. Mannon's bitterly rebukes her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) knows the house is not his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) and that Christine awaits his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) death to be free. Christine deliberately taunts that she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) has indeed become Brant's mistress. Mannon rises in fury, threatening her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) murder, and then falls back in agony, begging for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) medicine. Christine retrieves a box from her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) room and gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) the poison. Mannon realizes her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) treachery and calls Lavinia for help. Lavinia rushes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) father. With his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dying effort, Ezra indicts his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) wife: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)'s guilty--not medicine!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) gasps and then dies. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) strength gone, Christine collapses in a faint. Peter, Lavinia, and Orin arrive at the house. Orin disappointedly complains of Christine's absence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) jealously asks Lavinia about what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) regarding Brant. Lavinia warns him (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) against believing Christine's lies. Suddenly Christine hurries out, reproaching Peter for leaving Orin alone. Mother and son embrace jubilantly. Suspiciously Orin asks Christine about Brant. Christine explains that Lavinia has gone mad and begun to accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) of the impossible. Orin sits at Christine's feet and recounts his (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) wonderful dreams about her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) and the South Sea Islands. The Islands represented all the war was not: peace, warmth, and security, or Christina herself. Lavinia reappears and coldly calls Orin to see their father's body. In the study, Orin tells Lavinia that Christine has already warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) madness. Calculatingly Lavinia insists that Orin certainly cannot let their mother's paramour escape. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) proposes that they watch Christine until she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) goes to meet Brant herself. Orin agrees. The night after Ezra's funeral, Brant's clipper ship appears at a wharf in East Boston. Christine meets Brant on the deck, and they retire to the cabin to speak in private. Lavinia and an enraged Orin listen from the deck. The lovers decide to flee east and seek out their Blessed Islands. Fearing the hour, they painffully bid each other farewell. When Brant returns, Orin shoots him (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) and ransacks the room to make it seem that Brant has been robbed. The following night Christine paces the drive before the Mannon house. Orin and Lavinia appear, revealing that they killed Brant. Christine collapses. Orin knees beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) pleadingly, promising that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) happy, that they can leave Lavinia at home and go abroad together. Lavinia orders Orin into the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) obeys. Christine glares at her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) daughter with savage hatred and marches into the house. Lavinia determinedly turns her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) back on the house, standing like a sentinel. A shot is heard from Ezra's study. Lavinia stammers: <div class="bookquote">``It is justice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)</div>A year later, Lavinia and Orin return from their trip East. Lavinia's body has lost its military stiffness and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) resembles her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) mother perfectly. Orin has grown dreadfully thin and bears the statue-like attitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) father. In the sitting room, Orin grimly remarks that Lavinia's has stolen Christine's soul. Death has set her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) free to become her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>). Peter enters from the rear and gasps, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) has seen Christine's ghost. Lavinia approaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) eagerly. Orin jealously mocks his (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) sister, accusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) of becoming a true romantic during their time in the Islands. A month later, Orin works intently at a manuscript in the Mannon study. Lavinia knocks sharply at the locked door. With forced casualness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) asks Peter what he (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) is doing. Orin insists that they must atone for Mother's death. As the last male Mannon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) has written a history of the family crimes, from Abe's onward. Lavinia is the most interesting criminal of all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) only became pretty like Mother on Brant's Islands, with the natives staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) with desire. When Orin accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) of sleeping with one of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) assumes Christine's taunting voice. Reacting like Ezra, Orin grasps his (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) sister's throat, threatening her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) murder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) has taken Father's place and she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) Mother's. A moment later, Hazel and Peter appear in the sitting room. Orin enters, insisting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) see Hazel alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) a sealed envelope, enjoining her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) to keep it safe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should only open it if something happens to him (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) or if Lavinia tries to marry Peter. Lavinia enters from the hall. Hazel moves to leave, trying to keep Orin's envelope hidden behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) back. Rushing to Orin, Lavinia beseeches him (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) surrender it. Orin complies. Orin tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) sister she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) can never see Peter again. A <div class="bookquote">``distorted look of desire''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)</div>comes into his (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) face. Lavinia stares at him (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) in horror, saying, <div class="bookquote">``For God's sake--! No! You're insane! You can't mean--!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Lavinia wishes his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) death. Startled, Orin realizes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) death would be another act of justice. Mother is speaking through Lavinia. Peter appears in the doorway. Unnaturally casual, Orin remarks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) was about to go clean his (<font color='blue'><b>Orin</b></font>) pistol and exits. Lavinia throws herself into Peter's arms. A muffled shot is heard. Three days later, Lavinia appears dressed in deep mourning. A resolute Hazel arrives and insists that Lavinia not marry Peter. The Mannon secrets will prevent their happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) already has told Peter of Orin's envelope. Peter arrives, and the pair pledges their love anew. Started by the bitterness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) voice, Lavinia desperately flings herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) arms crying, <div class="bookquote">``Take me, Adam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)</div>Horrified, Lavinia orders Peter home. Lavinia cackles that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) is bound to the Mannon dead. Since there is no one left to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) must punish herself--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) must entomb herself in the house with the ancestors.
