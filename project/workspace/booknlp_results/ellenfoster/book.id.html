medication, eleven- year-old Ellen, the title character and narrator
of the book, must find herself a loving home and family to take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) in. Immediately after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) mother's death, Ellen endures repeated
physical, psychological, and sexual abuse by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) alcoholic father
and, because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) father's habit, is forced to pay the bills,
shop for groceries, and cook for herself. Ellen retreats to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)
friend Starletta's house for refuge from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) food-grubbing,
flesh- grabbing friends. Starletta and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) parents, who are black,
live in a grungy cabin without an indoor bathroom. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) teacher finds a bruise on Ellen's arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) intervenes, and
Ellen is sent to live with Julia, the school's art teacher, and
Roy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) husband. Both Julia and Roy are young, liberal hippies
who care for Ellen as best they can while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) is with them. Together
with Starletta, they celebrate Ellen's eleventh birthday, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) had nearly forgotten. However, Ellen must leave Julia and Roy
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother battles for and wins custody of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) in court.
Ellen does not want to leave Julia and Roy to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother--a
cruel, miserly old woman who has scarcely talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) ever before--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)
must, per the court's orders. Ellen spends the summer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)
calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``mama's mama,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and is miserable with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother owns
farmland and orders Ellen to work the fields with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) black servants
beneath the scorching summer sun. While working the fields, Ellen
befriends Mavis, a kind black woman who teaches Ellen how to row
and who tells Ellen how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) mother as a child. Mavis
notes how much Ellen resembles Ellen's mother. Ellen's grandmother,
however, is insistent that Ellen is a mirror image of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) father,
a wretched man whom both Ellen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother hate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) is
constantly reminding Ellen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) is just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) father and somehow
wants revenge on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) torture of Ellen. Ellen's grandmother
also tells Ellen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) is to blame for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) mother's death, because
Ellen had allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) to die. During the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) stay with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother, Ellen's father dies, having suffered an aneurysm
as a result of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) habitual binge drinking. Ellen, who has thought
of killing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) father many times, had not planned on being sad to
hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) death. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) feels as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) does when a movie star
dies--a distant sadness--and sheds a single tear for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother
is furious at her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) show of emotion for her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) father and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) never
to cry again. Ellen is scarred for a long time afterwards, for at
the close of the book, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) still cannot bring herself to cry. After
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) father's death, Ellen determines that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother had been
paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) uncles, Rudolph and Ellis, to spy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) father
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) was still living with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). When Rudolph brings over the
flag that had been on Ellen's father's casket, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother turns
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) away and later burns the flag in a wood fire she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)'s made outside.
When her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother falls ill, Ellen cares for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) with the utmost
tenderness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) does not want to be blamed for yet another death.
Inevitably, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother dies, and Ellen frames her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) body with
fake flowers, as if to <div class="bookquote">``trick''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellen</b></font>)</div>God into accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) into heaven. After her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) grandmother's death, Ellen is sent to live with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) aunt Nadine, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) cousin Dora. Nadine and Dora treat Ellen
condescendingly and ignore her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) for being <div class="bookquote">``cheap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellen</b></font>)</div>though they have
little more money than Ellen and far less integrity. For Christmas,
Ellen wants to give Nadine and Dora a wonderful gift. Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)
cannot afford to buy them a present, Ellen uses her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) artistic talent
and paints them a picture of two cute-looking cats. Ellen would
not have personally chosen to paint cats, as they are empty of any
deep emotional quality, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) knows that Nadine and Dora will appreciate
them more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) pictures of the brooding ocean. When Nadine asks
Ellen what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) wants for Christmas, Ellen asks only for a package
of art paper, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) secretly hopes that Nadine will give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)
a few other surprise gifts. Ellen works up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) hope for these other
few gifts and for Nadine and Dora's appreciation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) cat painting.
Both of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) hopes, disappointingly, are crushed on Christmas Day
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) receives only the pack of white paper and later overhears
Nadine and Dora making disparaging remarks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Nadine</b></font>) painting, though
Nadine had pretended to like it earlier that morning. Upon hearing
this, Ellen is deeply ashamed and, moreover, enraged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) shuts
herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) room, and when Dora and Nadine aggravate her (<font color='blue'><b>Nadine</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Nadine</b></font>)
retaliates. Nadine orders Ellen out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) house on Christmas day,
and Ellen packs up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) box and walks across town to the Foster lady's
house in hopes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) in. Ellen wears her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) best dress so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) will make a good
first impression and, after a few moments of hesitation, knocks
on the Foster lady's'' door. The woman, soon to become Ellen's <div class="bookquote">``new mama,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellen</b></font>)</div>welcomes Ellen into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) warm home and is concerned for Ellen's well
being. Ellen offers her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) the one hundred and sixty six dollars she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)
has been saving for the past two years in exchange for a home and
a bit of attention. Ellen's new mama refuses the money but offers
to call the county the first thing the next morning to negotiate
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) adoption of Ellen. In bed that night, Ellen thinks to herself how
lucky she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) is to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) new mama, who, in the future, will provide
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) with plenty of love, food, and nurturing. After Ellen has settled in at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) new mama's house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)
wants to invite Starletta to sleep over, since they have drifted
apart as each has grown older. Ellen thinks how brave it is to be
breaking a social rule in having a black person sleep over a white
person's house. Ellen is ashamed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) remembers how, two years
ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) would not even eat supper with Starletta and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) family
and only because of their skin color. Now, Ellen vows to lick Starletta's
cup if that is what it takes to prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>). When Starletta
does come over Ellen's new house, Ellen confesses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) the remorse
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) feels for past prejudices and, ultimately, realizes that it
has been Starletta, not herself, who has had the most hardship to
endure.
