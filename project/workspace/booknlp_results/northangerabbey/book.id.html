It is divided into two sections, Book I and Book II. The two Books differ significantly from each other in setting and, to a degree, in tone. Book I begins when the Allens, family friends of the Morlands, offer to take Catherine with them to Bath, a resort for the wealthier members of British society. The 17-year-old Catherine eagerly accepts the Allens' invitation. Catherine is young and na√Øve. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life has been relatively sheltered, so Bath is a new world for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). In Bath, Catherine is introduced to Henry Tilney, a young clergyman who impresses Catherine with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) wit and pleasant conversation. Catherine quickly falls for Henry, but after their first meeting she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) does not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) again for some time. Mrs. Allen runs into an old acquaintance, Mrs. Thorpe, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) three young daughters, including Isabella, who is slightly older than Catherine. Catherine and Isabella are soon best friends. Isabella, superficial and fond of gossip, inducts Catherine into the social world of Bath, with all its balls, dances, shows, fashion, and its gossip. Just when Catherine and Isabella have settled into a close friendship, they are met with the arrival of James Morland, Catherine's brother, and John Thorpe, Isabella's brother. James and John are friends at Oxford University. Isabella wastes no time in flirting with James, and soon it is obvious to everyone except Catherine that James and Isabella are in love. Taking a cue from James, John tries to woo Catherine, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) dance partner. But at a ball, Catherine sees Henry Tilney again and is more interested in Henry than in John. John's bragging and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arrogant nature put off Catherine. Soon all of Isabella's time is taken up with James. Without Isabella to spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) time with and saddled with the unpleasant John Thorpe, Catherine decides to become friends with Eleanor Tilney, Henry's sister. Eleanor quickly sees that Catherine has feelings for Henry, but does not say anything. After rain seems to wash out her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) plans for a walk with Henry and Eleanor, Catherine is pressured by James and Isabella into riding with John, much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dismay. On the way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spots Henry and Eleanor walking toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) house for the planned walk. John refuses to stop, angering Catherine. Catherine apologizes to Eleanor and Henry, and plans are made for another walk. John, Isabella, and James again intervene, pressuring Catherine into another outing. Catherine firmly refuses this time and joins Eleanor and Henry in a walk around Beechen Cliff. They discuss novels, and Catherine is delighted to find that Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) does. Catherine returns home to discover that James and Isabella have become engaged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) briefly meets with John, who is leaving Bath for several weeks. John leaves with the false impression that Catherine is in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), although Catherine does not realize this. Book II begins with the arrival of Henry's older brother, Captain Frederick Tilney. Isabella quickly catches the eye of the captain and, dismayed by the discovery of James's modest income, begins to flirt with Frederick. Eleanor invites Catherine to visit the Tilney home in Northanger Abbey. The invitation is seconded by Eleanor's father, General Tilney. Catherine eagerly accepts the invitation, delighted at the prospect of visiting a real abbey and at seeing more of Henry. Before Catherine leaves, Isabella tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that John is planning to propose to Catherine. Catherine tells Isabella to write him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) apologies, that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is mistaken. Frederick appears and flirts with Isabella, who returns his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) attentions. Dismayed by this behavior, Catherine asks Henry to convince Frederick to leave Isabella alone. Henry refuses, knowing that Isabella is at least as guilty as the captain, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tells Catherine that Frederick will probably leave Bath with his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) regiment soon anyway. Catherine leaves with the Tilneys for Northanger Abbey. On the way, Catherine tells Henry how she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) imagines the Abbey to resemble the haunted ruins of the Gothic novels she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loves. Henry, amused, responds by giving a hypothetical account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first night at the Abbey, complete with mysterious chests, violent storms, and secret passages. Northanger Abbey turns out to be quite dull, having been fixed up by General Tilney. Due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) overactive imagination, Catherine entertains all sorts of frightening ideas about the place, each of which is thwarted. For instance, a strange bureau in Catherine's room turns out to contain nothing more mysterious than receipts. Catherine becomes intrigued by the death of Eleanor and Henry's mother years earlier. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind full of Gothic plots, Catherine suspects that General Tilney of murdering his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) wife. Catherine sneaks into the mother's old chamber and discovers nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is caught by Henry, who guesses her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thoughts and scolds her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Mortified and ashamed, Catherine quickly resumes her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) good behavior. Catherine receives a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) engagement to Isabella has been called off. Catherine thinks that Frederick forced himself between them, but Henry convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that it was as much Isabella's fault as Frederick's. Catherine visits Henry's house at Woodston. The General drops hints about Catherine marrying Henry. Catherine gets another letter, this time from Isabella, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that Frederick has left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and asking Catherine to apologize to James for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Angry at being manipulated, Catherine wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had never known Isabella. The General leaves on a business trip, and Henry goes back to Woodston for several days. The General then returns unexpectedly and tells Eleanor to send Catherine away the next morning. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is very embarrassed, Eleanor has no choice but to send Catherine to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) home in Fullerton. Catherine's family is irritated by the General's rudeness, but is glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) home. Catherine mopes around, despondent, until suddenly Henry arrives in Fullerton and proposes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Henry explains that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father's behavior was due to John Thorpe. In Bath, when John thought Catherine loved him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had told General Tilney that Catherine was from a very wealthy family. When the General ran into John much later, after Isabella had told John about Catherine's true feelings, John had angrily told the General that the Morlands were almost poor. Mortified, the General had sent Catherine away, furious that his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) hopes for John to make a wealthy match were to be frustrated. Henry and Catherine decide to wait until the General gives his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) consent to their marriage. Within a few months, Eleanor marries a very wealthy and important man, which puts the General in a good mood. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) is told of the true nature of the Morland's financial situation, which is moderate, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) gives his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) consent, and the novel ends with the marriage of Henry and Catherine.
