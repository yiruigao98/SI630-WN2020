Who was born in Newgate, and during a life of continu'd Variety for Threescore Years, besides her (<font color='blue'><b>Newgate</b></font>) Childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife -LRB-whereof once to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newgate</b></font>) own brother-RRB-, Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv'd Honest and died a Penitent. Written from her (<font color='blue'><b>Newgate</b></font>) own Memorandums.''  (<font color='red'><b>Moll/Moll Flanders</b></font>)</div>Moll Flanders is born to a mother who has been convicted of a felony and who is transported to America soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Newgate</b></font>) birth. As an infant, Moll lives on public charity, under the care of a kind widow who teaches her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) manners and needlework. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) grows into a beautiful teenager and is seduced at an early age. Abandoned by her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) first lover, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) is compelled to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) younger brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) dies after a few years, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) marries a draper who soon flees the country as a fugitive from the law. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) marries yet again and moves to America, only to find out that her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) husband is actually her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) half-brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in disgust and returns to England, where she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) becomes the mistress of a man whose wife has gone insane. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) renounces his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affair with Moll after a religious experience. Moll's next marriage offer is from a banker whose wife has been cheating on him (<font color='blue'><b>Moll</b></font>). Moll agrees to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Moll</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Moll</b></font>) can obtain a divorce, and meanwhile she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) travels to the country and marries a rich gentleman in Lancashire. This man turns out to be a fraud--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is as poor as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is--and they part ways to seek their fortunes separately. Moll returns to marry the banker, who by this time has succeeded in divorcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Moll</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moll</b></font>) dies soon after, however, and Moll is thrown back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own resources once again. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lives in poverty for several years and then begins stealing. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is quite talented at this new <div class="bookquote">``trade''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and soon becomes an expert thief and a local legend. Eventually she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is caught, imprisoned, and sentenced to death. In prison at Newgate, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reunites with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Lancashire husband, who has also been arrested. They both manage to have their sentences reduced, and they are transported to the colonies, where they begin a new life as plantation owners. In America, Moll rediscovers her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) son and claims the inheritance her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother has left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Prosperous and repentant, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) returns with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband to England at the age of seventy.
