his aunt, Lady Brandon, the well-known artist Basil Hallward meets
Dorian Gray. Dorian is a cultured, wealthy, and impossibly beautiful
young man who immediately captures Basil's artistic imagination.
Dorian sits for several portraits, and Basil often depicts him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) as
an ancient Greek hero or a mythological figure. When the novel opens,
the artist is completing his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) first portrait of Dorian as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) truly
is, but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) admits to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) friend Lord Henry Wotton, the painting
disappoints him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) because it reveals too much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) feeling for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
subject. Lord Henry, a famous wit who enjoys scandalizing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) friends by celebrating youth, beauty, and the selfish pursuit
of pleasure, disagrees, claiming that the portrait is Basil's masterpiece.
Dorian arrives at the studio, and Basil reluctantly introduces him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
to Lord Henry, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fears will have a damaging influence on the impressionable,
young Dorian. Basil's fears are well founded; before the end of their
first conversation, Lord Henry upsets Dorian with a speech about
the transient nature of beauty and youth. Worried that these, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
most impressive characteristics, are fading day by day, Dorian curses
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) portrait, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) believes will one day remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) of the beauty
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) will have lost. In a fit of distress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) pledges his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) soul if
only the painting could bear the burden of age and infamy, allowing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) to stay forever young. After Dorian's outbursts, Lord Henry
reaffirms his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) desire to own the portrait; however, Basil insists
the portrait belongs to Dorian. Over the next few weeks, Lord Henry's influence over
Dorian grows stronger. The youth becomes a disciple of the <div class="bookquote">``new
Hedonism''  (<font color='red'><b>youth a disciple</b></font>)</div>and proposes to live a life dedicated to the pursuit of
pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) falls in love with Sibyl Vane, a young actress who
performs in a theater in London's slums. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) adores her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) acting; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>),
in turn, refers to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``Prince Charming''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and refuses to heed
the warnings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) brother, James Vane, that Dorian is no good
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). Overcome by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) emotions for Dorian, Sibyl decides that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) can no longer act, wondering how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) can pretend to love on
the stage now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) has experienced the real thing. Dorian, who
loves Sibyl because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) ability to act, cruelly
breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) engagement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). After doing so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) returns home
to notice that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) face in Basil's portrait of him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) has changed:
it now sneers. Frightened that his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) wish for his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) likeness in the
painting to bear the ill effects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) behavior has come true and
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sins will be recorded on the canvas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) resolves to make
amends with Sibyl the next day. The following afternoon, however,
Lord Henry brings news that Sibyl has killed herself. At Lord Henry's
urging, Dorian decides to consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) death a sort of artistic
triumph--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) personified tragedy--and to put the matter behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).
Meanwhile, Dorian hides his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) portrait in a remote upper room of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
house, where no one other than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) can watch its transformation. Lord Henry gives Dorian a book that describes the wicked exploits
of a nineteenth-century Frenchman; it becomes Dorian's bible as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) sinks ever deeper into a life of sin and corruption. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) lives a
life devoted to garnering new experiences and sensations with no regard
for conventional standards of morality or the consequences of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
actions. Eighteen years pass. Dorian's reputation suffers in circles
of polite London society, where rumors spread regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) scandalous
exploits. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) peers nevertheless continue to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) remains young and beautiful. The figure in the painting, however,
grows increasingly wizened and hideous. On a dark, foggy night,
Basil Hallward arrives at Dorian's home to confront him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) about the
rumors that plague his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) reputation. The two argue, and Dorian eventually
offers Basil a look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) -LRB-Dorian's-RRB- soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shows Basil the now-hideous
portrait, and Hallward, horrified, begs him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) to repent. Dorian claims
it is too late for penance and kills Basil in a fit of rage. In order to dispose of the body, Dorian employs
the help of an estranged friend, a doctor, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) blackmails. The
night after the murder, Dorian makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) way to an opium den, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) encounters James Vane, who attempts to avenge Sibyl's death. Dorian
escapes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) country estate. While entertaining guests, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) notices
James Vane peering in through a window, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) becomes wracked by
fear and guilt. When a hunting party accidentally shoots and kills
Vane, Dorian feels safe again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) resolves to amend his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) life but
cannot muster the courage to confess his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) crimes, and the painting
now reveals his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) supposed desire to repent for what it is--hypocrisy.
In a fury, Dorian picks up the knife he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) used to stab Basil Hallward
and attempts to destroy the painting. There is a crash, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
servants enter to find the portrait, unharmed, showing Dorian Gray
as a beautiful young man. On the floor lies the body of their master--an
old man, horribly wrinkled and disfigured, with a knife plunged
into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart.
