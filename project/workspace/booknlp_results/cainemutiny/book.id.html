Mrs. Keith drops him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) off, lavishing on him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) all of the motherly pampering she (<font color='blue'><b>Keith</b></font>) can before he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) leaves. Willie goes into the Columbia University School of Journalism, which has been converted for the war effort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) is almost rejected for physical reasons, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) Princeton background carries him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) though. Willie meets his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) roommates, Roland Keefer, a chubby, lazy, dedicated man from a military prep school, and Edwin Keggs, a high school algebra teacher. The three of them will live in Furnald Hall. Many hijinks ensue, but all three men make the cut and earn positions as officers in the Navy. Willie is almost kicked out on demerits he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) gets because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) relationship with a lounge singer, May Wynn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wynn</b></font>) likes May a lot, but thinks of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) as a fun fling. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is from a lower class Italian family, which makes her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) unsuitable in Willie's eyes. Willie is assigned to the DMS Caine for minesweeping duty in Pearl Harbor, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) arrives to find the ship already departed. Willie and Roland manage to get plush shore assignments until the Caine returns, mostly because of Willie's piano playing for a resident admiral. When the Caine returns to port, Willie is dragged from a drunken sleep early in the morning to join the crew. The ship is in bad repair, and is run by a tyrant named De Vriess. Willie is indoctrinated into the ship's ragtag communications department, which is managed by Lieutenant Tom Keefer, Roland's brother and a budding novelist. The ship spends its time in Pearl Harbor running exercises and performing menial tasks. Willie writes to May regularly and eagerly awaits her (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) replies. One day Willie forgets about an urgent dispatch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) pocket while observing a minesweeping exercise from the bridge. De Vriess chews him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) out for the incident when he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) discovers the missing log, and Willie takes offense. Willie considers asking for reassignment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) changes his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) mind upon receiving a package from his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) father, who on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) deathbed sent Willie a Bible and a note telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), among other things, to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) absolute best at whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) committed to. Willie stays on the Caine. A new captain takes command of the ship: Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg, who surprises the crew of the Caine by arriving unannounced and catching the ship in its disheveled state. Though the Caine is his (<font color='blue'><b>Caine</b></font>) first command, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Caine</b></font>) has never served on a four-pipe minesweeper before, Queeg completes the transfer of command in a mere forty-eight hours, without allowing De Vriess to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Vriess</b></font>) how the ship really works. As soon as De Vriess leaves the ship, things begin to change. Queeg begins making new demands of the crew in an attempt to restore it to Navy regulations. Willie takes to the new captain at once. Queeg's first attempt at conning the ship is a complete disaster. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) attempts to turn the ship too quickly when backing out of the slip and badly scrapes the side of a neighboring ship. Queeg then forgets to stop the engines and grounds the ship on the other side of the channel. In another symbolic incident, while Queeg is busy reprimanding a sailor for having his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) shirttail out, he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) forgets to stop the ship's turn, and accidentally crosses and cuts the towline they had been using to drag targets. These incidents cause Pacific Command to become suspicious of the new captain of the Caine, so they send him (<font color='blue'><b>Caine</b></font>) to San Francisco for a refitting instead of sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) directly to combat action. Even on this very safe mission, Queeg creates trouble by trying to smuggle liquor to the states. The loss of the booze falls on Willie and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) is forced to pay for it before he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) is allowed to take shore leave. May Wynn and Mrs. Keith are both waiting for their war hero in San Francisco when the Caine finally arrives. Willie is forced to introduce May to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) mother for the first time. Mrs. Keith is not exactly pleased with Willie's girlfriend, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Keith</b></font>) still allows her (<font color='blue'><b>Keith</b></font>) son to take May to Yosemite for the weekend. On the trip, May and Willie sleep together for the first time, greatly complicating their relationship. The next day, Willie proposes to May, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Keith</b></font>) gives no definite answer, and the issue is deferred. Back in San Francisco, Willie has a long talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) mother about May, and is still convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) relationship will not work out. When the Caine finally makes it to combat action, Captain Queeg's performance reveals further weaknesses in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caine</b></font>) ability to command. On a routine escort mission, the captain panics upon realizing how close they will have to go to the shore, and speeds ahead of the group that the Caine was supposed to protect. In another incident, a neighboring ship is straddled by gunfire from a shore battery. Though the battery is easily within range, Queeg does not fire a shot, but instead steams off as fast as the Caine's engines allow. When the ship patrols enemy waters, Queeg always stands on the side of the ship farthest from the shore, which adds to the crew's suspicions of cowardice in their captain. On top of this, the captain piles ridiculous punishments on the crew in response to menial offenses, ordering water famines, denial of liberties, and deprivation of sleep. The executive officer, a peacetime fisherman named Steve Maryk begins a secret log of the captain's questionable activities. Tensions between captain and crew come to a head when an unexpected hurricane strikes the Caine while it is supporting a fueling convoy for the attack on the Philippines. The ship is unable to maintain its course because of the strength of the wind. Despite this, Queeg ignores Maryk's recommendations to save the ship by ballasting the water tanks, securing the ammunition, and coming into the wind. The captain becomes frozen with fear, clutching the engine telegraph and responding only to insist that they maintain fleet course with their stern into the wind. Finally, the wind takes the ship and swings it broadside to the waves. Maryk states that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is relieving Queeg of command due to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) mental sickness on the authority of article 184 of Naval Regulations. Willie, as officer of the deck, is forced to confirm or deny the order, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) sides with Maryk. The exec successfully pilots the ship out of the typhoon and even picks up survivors from a downed destroyer in the process. Queeg asks to reassume command several times, but Maryk sticks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) decision to take responsibility for the ship and crew. When the Caine arrives back in port, proceedings for a court martial begin immediately. Queeg is kept on shore to undergo a lengthy psychological examination, but Maryk is ordered to take the Caine back out to help with some urgent escort duty. On the tour, the Caine is struck by a kamikaze, but Maryk handles the fire fighting and damage control perfectly. When the ship finally arrives back in San Francisco, the court martial proceedings begin in earnest. All of the Navy's legal officers shun assignment to the case, predicting that defending mutineers would ruin their careers. Finally, a Jewish lawyer from New York, Barney Greenwald, takes the case. Willie is given pity leave to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) family and May before he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) has to testify. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) goes back determined to break off his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) relationship with May. The first night of Willie's leave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) ends the relationship and promises to call, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) will not. Greenwald gets Maryk acquitted by using dirty tricks and playing on predictable Navy mentalities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenwald</b></font>) confuses the two psychologists and gets them to admit that though Queeg is normally well adjusted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenwald</b></font>) is prone to breakdown in certain extreme circumstances. Greenwald uses Willie's heated testimony to reveal the captain's cowardice, which the distinguished sailors in the jury find embarrassing. Greenwald puts so much stress on Queeg while Queeg testifies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenwald</b></font>) becomes the panicky paranoid he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenwald</b></font>) had been at sea. After the acquittal, the sailors proceed to a party thrown by Keefer with the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Keefer</b></font>) received for the presale of his (<font color='blue'><b>Keefer</b></font>) war novel. Though Keefer had betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Keefer</b></font>) friend in the courtroom to protect himself, Keefer is the most jubilant of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Keefer</b></font>) celebrators. Greenwald stumbles in drunk and reprimands the crew for destroying a sacred military trust. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenwald</b></font>) says it was the Queegs of the regular Navy who saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenwald</b></font>) Jewish grandmother. Greenwald ends the toast by throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenwald</b></font>) champagne in Keefer's face, exposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenwald</b></font>) as the true source of blame for the mutiny. All of the accused are free to continue their military careers. The crew of the Caine is mostly split up to reduce the chance of another incident. Maryk is given an insulting command of a lowly transport craft, and Queeg is assigned to a supply depot in Iowa. Keefer remains on the Caine and becomes captain. Willie is elevated to the position of executive officer. To the surprise of the crew, Keefer becomes just like Queeg, hiding from the crew most of the time and leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Keefer</b></font>) cabin only to scold and punish people for trivial offenses. His (<font color='blue'><b>Keefer</b></font>) first test as captain arises when a kamikaze crashes into the mid- ship area of the Caine and causes massive damage. Keefer abandons ship, diving into the Pacific with the manuscript of his (<font color='blue'><b>Keefer</b></font>) novel clutched under his (<font color='blue'><b>Keefer</b></font>) good arm. Willie remains onboard, and with the help of some other brave sailors, eventually manages to put out the fire and get the ship underway again. They pick up the sailors who jumped, including Keefer, who swears that Willie will get a medal for his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) bravery. In the near-death experience of the kamikaze hit, Willie's life flashed before his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) realized that the one thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) regretted was not marrying May Wynn. That night, Willie writes her (<font color='blue'><b>sailors</b></font>) an eight-page letter begging her (<font color='blue'><b>sailors</b></font>) to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) and be his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) sends it away and spends the last months of the war eagerly awaiting a reply. The reply never arrives. When the war ends, Keefer is decommissioned and Willie becomes captain of the damaged Caine. Another typhoon strikes, but Willie expertly manipulates the ship's rudder and engines to keep it from dragging anchor. The next day, in a rash move, Willie and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) old midshipmen's school buddy Keggs go to fleet command to request permission to take the Caine back to the states for scrapping. The Caine is so badly damaged she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could neither perform minesweeping duties nor risk weathering another hurricane. Willie convinces the operations officer to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) take the Caine back to New York so that the Navy will at least get scrap value for the old hulk. Three weeks later, without pomp, the Caine arrives for decommissioning in Bayonne, New Jersey. Willie performs the ship's last solemn rites, and then allows his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) mother to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) back home, exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had dropped him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) off more than a year ago. Willie interrupts May Wynn at a rehearsal in New York. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has become a big success as a singer and begun dating her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bandleader. Willie once again asks May to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), and though the book ends with the question unanswered, the two part on good terms, promising to see each other the next day.
