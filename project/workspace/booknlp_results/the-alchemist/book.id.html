He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) has the dream every time he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) sleeps under a sycamore tree that grows out of the ruins
of a church. During the dream, a child tells him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) to seek treasure at the foot of the
Egyptian pyramids. Santiago consults a gypsy woman to interpret the dream, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)
surprise she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) to go to Egypt. A strange, magical old man named Melchizedek, who
claims to be the King of Salem, echoes the gypsy's advice and tells Santiago that it is
his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Personal Legend to journey to the pyramids. Melchizedek convinces Santiago to sell
his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) flock and set off to Tangier. When Santiago arrives in Tangier, a thief robs him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>),
forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) to find work with a local crystal merchant. The conservative and kindly
merchant teaches Santiago several lessons, and Santiago encourages the merchant to take
risks with his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) business. The risks pay off, and Santiago becomes a rich man in just a
year. Santiago decides to cash in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earnings and continue pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Personal
Legend: to find treasure at the pyramids. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) joins a caravan crossing the Sahara desert
toward Egypt and meets an Englishman who is studying to become an alchemist. He (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) learns a
lot from the Englishman during the journey. For one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) learns that the secret of
alchemy is written on a stone called the Emerald Tablet. The ultimate creation of
alchemy is the Master Work, which consists of a solid called the Philosophers Stone that
can turn lead to gold, and a liquid called the Elixir of Life that can cure all ills.
Santiago learns the Englishman is traveling with the caravan to the Saharan oasis of
Al-Fayoum, where a powerful, 200-year-old alchemist resides. The Englishman plans to ask
the alchemist the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) trade. As it turns out, the caravan must make an extended stop in Al-Fayoum in order to
avoid increasingly violent tribal wars taking place in the desert. There, Santiago falls
in love with Fatima, who lives at the oasis. During a walk in the desert, Santiago
witnesses an omen that portends an attack on the historically neutral oasis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) warns
the tribal chieftains of the attack, and as a result, Al-Fayoum successfully defends
itself against the assault. The alchemist gets word of Santiago's vision and invites
Santiago on a trip into the desert, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) teaches Santiago about the
importance of listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) heart and pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) Personal Legend. He (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) convinces
Santiago to leave Fatima and the caravan for the time to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) journey to the
pyramids, and he (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) offers to accompany Santiago on the next leg of his (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) trip. While the alchemist and Santiago continue through the desert, the alchemist shares
much of his (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) wisdom about the Soul of the World. They are mere days away from the
pyramids when a tribe of Arab soldiers captures them. In exchange for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) life and the
life of Santiago, the alchemist hands over to the tribe all of Santiago's money and
tells the soldiers that Santiago is a powerful alchemist who will turn into wind within
three days. Santiago feels alarmed because he (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) has no idea how to turn into the wind, and
over the next three days he (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) contemplates the desert. On the third day, he (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) communicates
with the wind and the sun and coaxes them to help him (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) create a tremendous sandstorm. He (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>)
prays to the Hand That Wrote All, and at the height of the storm he (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) disappears. He (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>)
reappears on the other side of the camp, and the tribesmen, awed by the power of the
storm and by Santiago's ability, let him (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) and the alchemist go free. The alchemist continues to travel with Santiago as far as a Coptic monastery
several hours from the pyramids. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) demonstrates to Santiago his (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) ability to turn
lead into gold using the Philosopher's Stone. He (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) gives Santiago gold and sends him (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) off.
Santiago begins digging for the treasure at the foot of the pyramids, but two men accost
him (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>). When Santiago speaks to them about his (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) dream vision, they decide he (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>)
must have no money and let him (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) live. Before leaving, one of the men tries to illustrate
the worthlessness of dreams by telling Santiago about his (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) own dream. It concerns a
treasure buried in an abandoned church in Spain where a sycamore tree grows. The church
is the same one in which Santiago had his (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) original dream, and he (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) finally understands
where his (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) treasure is. He (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) returns to Spain to find a chest of jewels and gold buried
under the tree, and plans to return with it to Al-Fayoum, where he (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>) will reunite with
Fatima, who awaits him (<font color='blue'><b>alchemist</b></font>).
