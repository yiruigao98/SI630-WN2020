I. Mr. Ramsay and Mrs. Ramsay bring their eight children to their
summer home in the Hebrides -LRB-a group of islands west of Scotland-RRB-.
Across the bay from their house stands a large lighthouse. Six-year-old James
Ramsay wants desperately to go to the lighthouse, and Mrs. Ramsay
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) that they will go the next day if the weather permits.
James reacts gleefully, but Mr. Ramsay tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) coldly that the weather
looks to be foul. James resents his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) father and believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
enjoys being cruel to James and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) siblings. The Ramsays host a number of guests, including the dour Charles
Tansley, who admires Mr. Ramsay's work as a metaphysical philosopher.
Also at the house is Lily Briscoe, a young painter who begins a
portrait of Mrs. Ramsay. Mrs. Ramsay wants Lily to marry William
Bankes, an old friend of the Ramsays, but Lily resolves to remain
single. Mrs. Ramsay does manage to arrange another marriage, however,
between Paul Rayley and Minta Doyle, two of their acquaintances. During the course of the afternoon, Paul proposes to
Minta, Lily begins her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) painting, Mrs. Ramsay soothes the resentful
James, and Mr. Ramsay frets over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) shortcomings as a philosopher,
periodically turning to Mrs. Ramsay for comfort. That evening, the
Ramsays host a seemingly ill-fated dinner party. Paul and Minta
are late returning from their walk on the beach with two of the
Ramsays' children. Lily bristles at outspoken comments made by Charles Tansley,
who suggests that women can neither paint nor write. Mr. Ramsay
reacts rudely when Augustus Carmichael, a poet, asks for a second
plate of soup. As the night draws on, however, these missteps right
themselves, and the guests come together to make a memorable evening. The joy, however, like the party itself, cannot last,
and as Mrs. Ramsay leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) guests in the dining room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) reflects
that the event has already slipped into the past. Later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) joins
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) husband in the parlor. The couple sits quietly together, until
Mr. Ramsay's characteristic insecurities interrupt their peace.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) wants his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) wife to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>). Mrs. Ramsay is
not one to make such pronouncements, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) concedes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) point
made earlier in the day that the weather will be too rough for a
trip to the lighthouse the next day. Mr. Ramsay thus knows that
Mrs. Ramsay loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>). Night falls, and one night quickly becomes
another. Time passes more quickly as the novel enters the <div class="bookquote">``Time
Passes''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>segment. War breaks out across Europe. Mrs. Ramsay dies
suddenly one night. Andrew Ramsay, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) oldest son, is killed in
battle, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) sister Prue dies from an illness related to childbirth.
The family no longer vacations at its summerhouse, which falls into
a state of disrepair: weeds take over the garden and spiders nest
in the house. Ten years pass before the family returns. Mrs. McNab,
the housekeeper, employs a few other women to help set the house
in order. They rescue the house from oblivion and decay, and everything
is in order when Lily Briscoe returns. In <div class="bookquote">``The Lighthouse''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ramsay</b></font>)</div>section, time returns to the slow
detail of shifting points of view, similar in style to <div class="bookquote">``The Window.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ramsay</b></font>)</div>Mr. Ramsay declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) and James and Cam, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) daughters,
will journey to the lighthouse. On the morning of the voyage, delays throw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) into a fit of temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) appeals to Lily for sympathy, but, unlike
Mrs. Ramsay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) is unable to provide him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) needs. The
Ramsays set off, and Lily takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) place on the lawn, determined
to complete a painting she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) started but abandoned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) last visit.
James and Cam bristle at their father's blustery behavior and are
embarrassed by his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) constant self-pity. Still, as the boat reaches
its destination, the children feel a fondness for him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). Even James,
whose skill as a sailor Mr. Ramsay praises, experiences a moment
of connection with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsay</b></font>) father, though James so willfully resents
him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). Across the bay, Lily puts the finishing touch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) painting.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) makes a definitive stroke on the canvas and puts her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) brush down,
finally having achieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) vision.
