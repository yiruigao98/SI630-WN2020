The complete histories emerge gradually over the course of the book, with bits of information appearing in successive stories to clarify, complete, and sometimes controvert the information given in previous stories. But each story has its own plot, as well, independent of the other stories. The stories are: <div class="bookquote">``Was,''  (<font color='red'><b>McCaslin</b></font>)</div>in which young McCaslin Edmonds helps his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) Uncle Buck chase the slave Turl to Hubert Beauchamp's plantation, where Buck narrowly avoids having to marry Beauchamp's sister Sophonsiba, and returns with Tennie, a slave for Turl to marry--which will stop him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) from escaping so often. <div class="bookquote">``The Fire and the Hearth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucas</b></font>)</div>in which Lucas Beauchamp, Carothers McCaslin's grandson descended from a negro lover, searches for buried treasure on the McCaslin plantation, only to be thwarted by his (<font color='blue'><b>McCaslin</b></font>) wife's decision to divorce him (<font color='blue'><b>McCaslin</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The Pantaloon in Black,''  (<font color='red'><b>a negro</b></font>)</div>in which a big negro named Rider struggles with grief over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rider</b></font>) wife Mannie's early death and ends up killing a white man and getting lynched in retribution. <div class="bookquote">``The Old People,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>in which a young boy named Isaac McCaslin, under the tutelage of his (<font color='blue'><b>McCaslin</b></font>) part-Indian mentor Sam Fathers, kills his (<font color='blue'><b>McCaslin</b></font>) first buck, is anointed in its blood, and sees a giant, almost mystical buck that Sam refers to as <div class="bookquote">``grandfather.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Bear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isaac McCaslin</b></font>)</div>in which Isaac McCaslin becomes a master hunter and, with the group of older hunters at Major de Spain's camp, tracks Old Ben, a giant bear; later, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) experiences cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) to repudiate his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) birthright and refuse the inheritance of the McCaslin plantation, out of a belief that no man can own the land. <div class="bookquote">``Delta Autumn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isaac McCaslin</b></font>)</div>in which Isaac McCaslin, now an old man, goes on a final hunting trip to the Mississippi River Delta, where he (<font color='blue'><b>McCaslin</b></font>) meets a young woman who has had Carothers Edmonds's child. <div class="bookquote">``Go Down, Moses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gavin</b></font>)</div>in which Gavin Stevens, the Jefferson district attorney, helps Molly Beauchamp acquire the body of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) executed grandson.
