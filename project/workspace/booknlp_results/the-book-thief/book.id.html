The first time he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) saw the book thief, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) says, was on a train. The next time he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) was when he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) came for a pilot who had crashed his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) plane. And the third time was after a bombing. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) associates a color with each sighting: white, red, and black, the colors of the Nazi flag. Death then begins the story. Liesel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) mother, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) brother Werner are traveling on a train to Munich when Werner suddenly dies. Liesel and her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) mother get off the train to bury the body, and Liesel steals a book from one of the gravediggers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) mother continue their journey to a town called Molching, where Liesel will be raised by foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann. At first Liesel doesn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) foster parents, but Hans wins her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) over by teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) to roll cigarettes for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>). Slowly, Liesel adjusts to her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) new life, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) is plagued by nightmares of her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) dead brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) meets and befriends a neighborhood boy named Rudy, who worships the American athlete Jesse Owens and constantly pesters Liesel to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesse</b></font>). When Hans discovers that Liesel doesn't know how to read, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) begins teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) the alphabet, and together they make their way through the book Liesel stole from the gravedigger. Meanwhile, the political situation in Molching and throughout Germany is becoming serious, with war escalating and food and work shortages at home. When the town holds a book-burning to celebrate Hitler's birthday, Liesel steals another book from the flames. Liesel begins delivering laundry for Rosa. One of Rosa's customers is the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann. One day Liesel is invited into Ilsa Hermann's study, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) marvels at the walls of books. Frau Hermann allows her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) to read in the study. Meanwhile, in Stuttgart, a German Jew named Max hides in a closet with no food, light, or water. A friend brings him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) false identity papers and a map hidden in MKPF, Hitler's autobiography. Max leaves the closet and takes the train to the Hubermanns' house. Hans, we learn, served with Max's father in World War I. After Max's father died, Hans promised Max's mother he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) would always help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). When Max arrives in Molching, Hans and Rosa hide him (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) in the basement. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) recovers from his (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) ordeal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) and Liesel become friends, and Max writes her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) a book on the painted-over pages of MKPF. Frau Hermann tells Liesel she (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) can't afford to send out the laundry anymore. Liesel is furious because her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) family is already struggling to survive and the Hermanns have so much. With Rudy's help, Liesel begins sneaking into the Hermanns' library and stealing books. For Christmas, Liesel builds Max a snowman in the basement. When Max gets sick and falls into a coma, Hans and Rosa worry about how they will dispose of the corpse if he (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) dies. After months, Max recovers. Nazi soldiers arrive and inspect the basement to see if it is deep enough for a bomb shelter. Luckily, they don't see Max. Liesel continues stealing books from the Hermanns' library. Frau Hermann leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) a dictionary and thesaurus with a note saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) knows Liesel has been stealing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>). At a Hitler Youth carnival, Rudy wins three races. The Allies begin bombing near Molching, and the people on Liesel's block must take shelter in a neighbor's basement. With each raid, Liesel reads to them until it's safe to exit. Max, meanwhile, has to stay in the Hubermanns' basement by himself. As the war intensifies, Nazi soldiers begin parading Jewish prisoners through town on their way to the concentration camp at Dachau. When Hans sees an old man struggling to keep up with the group, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) a piece of bread. Nazi soldiers intervene and whip both the man and Hans. Hans realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) has aroused suspicion and drawn attention to himself, and Max is no longer safe in the basement. That night, Max leaves Hans and Rosa's house. Hans waits for soldiers to come take him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) away, but none do. Instead, they come to Rudy's house, to recruit him (<font color='blue'><b>Rudy</b></font>) for a school for future Nazi leaders. Rudy's father, Alex, refuses to let his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son go. The soldiers leave, but a few days later both Alex and Hans are drafted into the German army. After Alex and Hans leave for duty, Rudy and Liesel go to the next parade of Jews and scatter bread in the streets. Rosa gives Liesel a book that Max made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``The Word Shaker.''  (<font color='red'><b>Max</b></font>)</div>It is the story of Max and Liesel's friendship, and promises they will be reunited some day. Hans is sent to Essen, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) is part of a squad that cleans up after air raids. Another member of the squad takes a dislike to Hans, and one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) insists they change places on their work bus. The bus crashes and the other man is killed, while Hans merely breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) leg. Hans gets sent home to recuperate. Following another air raid, Liesel and Rudy find an Allied fighter pilot who has crashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) plane. They arrive just in time to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) die. Death sees Liesel for the second time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) comes to collect the pilot's soul. The Nazis continue to parade the Jews through Molching, and Liesel sees Max among the prisoners. Liesel tells Rudy about hiding Max. She (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) had never told anyone before. The mayor's wife gives Liesel a blank notebook so she (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) can begin writing her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) own story. One night, while Liesel is in the basement editing her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) book, her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) neighborhood is bombed. Hans, Rosa, Rudy, and the rest of the neighbors are killed. When rescue workers pull Liesel out of the rubble, she (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) finds Rudy's corpse and gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Rudy</b></font>) the kiss he (<font color='blue'><b>Rudy</b></font>) always wanted. When the workers take her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) leaves behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) finished book, called <div class="bookquote">``The Book Thief.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Death, who has been watching, rescues the book. Liesel goes to live with the mayor and his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) wife. After the liberation of the concentration camps, Max returns to Molching and finds Liesel. They hug and cry together. Liesel eventually grows up and moves to Australia, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) has a family and lives to an old age. When Death finally comes to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) the book she (<font color='blue'><b>Liesel</b></font>) wrote so many years before.
