into a lodging house in a medium-sized, generic town, which is never
named. Despairing and melancholy, Harry feels himself to be <div class="bookquote">``a wolf
of the Steppes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Steppenwolf,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>adrift and alone in a world that
is incomprehensible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and offers him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) no joy. Steppenwolf recounts
Harry's pain and anxiety as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tries to overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crippling sense
of dislocation and despair at the futility of humanity. Harry is repulsed by the productive, organized, and diligent
optimism of the bourgeoisie, or middle class. Even so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is bewitched
by its charms. Caught between the urges of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wolf-half and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
man-half, Harry can neither completely disavow nor embrace a conventional
way of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) regularly contemplates committing suicide. One night, while Harry walks unhappily through an old
quarter of the city, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sees a sign over a door he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has never noticed
before. The sign reads <div class="bookquote">``MAGIC THEATER--ENTRANCE NOT FOR EVERYBODY.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>More letters reflected on the street spell out <div class="bookquote">``FOR MADMEN
ONLY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry cannot open the door, but a sign-bearer advertising
the Magic Theater gives Harry a booklet entitled <div class="bookquote">``Treatise on the
Steppenwolf.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>This booklet contains a precise description of the
way Harry feels as a Steppenwolf. It speaks of a person who is half
man and half wolf who hates the bourgeois lifestyle but who is also
at the same time incapable of surrendering himself to the pleasure
of the senses. Harry soon becomes even more certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must kill
himself immediately. At a professor's house, Harry gravely insults
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) former colleague about  the way Goethe, the famous German poet, is
represented in a portrait that hangs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) home. Feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has
at last severed all ties to humanity, Harry plans to commit suicide
that evening. However, Harry meets an enchanting young girl in a
tavern that night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sensible and maternal advice.
The two meet again the following week. Because the girl resembles
a boyhood friend of Harry's named Herman, Harry guesses that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
is called Hermine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is correct. Hermine begins to help Harry.
Grateful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermine</b></font>) has broken through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) isolation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) agrees to
obey all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermine</b></font>) commands. Hermine informs Harry that eventually she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermine</b></font>)
will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermine</b></font>), then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermine</b></font>) will ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to kill
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermine</b></font>). Hermine teaches Harry to dance, finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a lover named
Maria, and introduces him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to an enigmatic and beautiful jazz musician named
Pablo. Through Hermine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermine</b></font>) friends, Harry begins to immerse
himself in a hedonistic, or pleasure-filled, way of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) comes
to appreciate all the sensual aspects of life he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had previously disregarded
because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strict bourgeois upbringing. With Hermine and Maria,
everything from buying little love gifts to picking duck meat from
its bones becomes a delightful affair. Harry blooms and becomes
happy during these weeks of change. Despite the enjoyment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feels,
however, part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remains repulsed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) transformation. Part
of Harry continues to aspire toward the spiritual and the divine,
away from the sordid pleasures of the flesh. When Harry confesses
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feelings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finds that Hermine understands him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) perfectly. In
fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermine</b></font>) understands him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) understands himself. Harry's concerns peak at the Fancy Dress Ball, a gala
masquerade dance Harry attends. After several hours of liberating,
riotous revelry, Harry consummates his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) love with Hermine through
a nuptial dance. As the ball comes to a close, Pablo invites Harry
and Hermine to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Magic Theater. Pablo explains to Harry
that the goal of the theater is the dissolution of the personality,
a goal that can be accomplished only through laughter. Once inside this <div class="bookquote">``school of humor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry laughs at a
mirror image of himself and goes down a corridor lined with dozens
of strange doors, some of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enters. Each door opens on a
new, surreal world. Harry runs from one world, in which men and machines
are engrossed in a bloody war, to another, where all the women he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
has ever wanted are available for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to enjoy. Reality quickly falls away as the novel brings us deeper
and deeper into the psyche of the Steppenwolf. Harry ends up in
a room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finds Hermine and Pablo's love-spent, naked bodies
lying on the floor. Believing that the moment has come to fulfill
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) promise to kill Hermine, Harry stabs her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermine</b></font>) with a knife that has
magically appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket. The celebrated classical composer
Mozart appears and tells Harry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has abused the Magic Theater
with such excessively serious behavior. Mozart explains that life
is always compromised and full of less-than-ideal circumstances,
and that the task Harry must face now is to greet these aspects
with laughter. Although Harry has failed this time, according to
Pablo, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leaves the theater with the deep belief that one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
will get things right.
