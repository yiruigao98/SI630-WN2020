with grief. She (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) makes her (<font color='blue'><b>protagonist</b></font>) way to the waterfront, heading to Carter Bridge, intent on
throwing herself off. The action shifts to twenty-five years previous to this moment, in the village
of Ogboli in the Ibuza homeland. Agbadi, the esteemed local chief, is enamored by
the one woman he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) cannot possess, the beautiful and strong-willed Ona. During a
hunting trip, Agbadi is gored by an injured elephant and not expected to live long.
Ona slowly nurses him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) back to health. As he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) heals, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) humiliates her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) in the compound
by loudly forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) sexual attentions on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) becomes pregnant as the result
of this union. If it is a boy, the child will belong to Ona's father, but if it is a
girl, Agbadi will accept responsibility. When Nnu Ego is born, a medicine man
concludes that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chi, or guiding spirit, is the slave girl who
was forcibly killed and buried with one of Agbadi's wives. Within the year, Ona dies
during childbirth. Sixteen years later, Nnu Ego is of marrying age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) is first betrothed to
Amatokwu. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) does not become pregnant, relations cool between her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and
Amatokwu, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) is soon moved to another hut to make room for a new wife. Nnu Ego
is relegated to working in the fields and taking care of the new wife's infant son.
When Amatokwu catches Nnu Ego breast-feeding the hungry child, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) beats her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Nnu Ego
returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father to rest and recover, and the marriage ties are severed.
Dedicated to finding his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) daughter a better match, Agbadi arranges a marriage between
Nnu Ego and Nnaife, who lives in faraway Lagos. Nnaife's older brother escorts Nnu
Ego to the city and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) new life with Nnaife. Nnaife and Nnu Ego live in the Yaba compound, where Nnaife does laundry for
the Meers, a British couple. Happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marriage, Nnu Ego becomes pregnant and
gives birth to a son, Ngozi. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) also starts her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own business selling cigarettes and
matches beside the road. One morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) discovers Ngozi dead in their one-room
home. Distraught and devoid of hope, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) rushes to the waterfront to throw herself
off Carter Bridge. Nwakusor, an Ibo man coming off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shift at work, prevents her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
with the help of the crowd that has gathered. Recovering from Ngozi's death is a slow and painful process. Eventually, Nnu
Ego becomes pregnant again and gives birth to Oshia. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) decides to focus solely on
raising the child instead of making extra income at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) market stall. But economic
pressures set in when the Meers return to England and Nnaife is suddenly out of a
job. Nnu Ego resumes her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) local trade in cigarettes. Nnaife eventually secures a
position that takes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) far from home, working for a group of Englishmen. While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is away, British soldiers enter the abandoned compound and tell Nnu Ego that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and
Oshia must vacate the premises. Nnu Ego takes a rented room in another part of town,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) gives birth to another son, Adim. Left on their own, the family slowly
succumbs to malnutrition. Neighbors step in to help. Nnu Ego returns from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) search
for more contraband cigarettes to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband has returned, flush with
money. Nnu Ego secures a permanent stall in the marketplace and pressures Nnaife to
find his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) next job. One evening, Nnaife's friends arrive with the news that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brother has died
in Ibuza. Nnaife has inherited all of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brother's wives, but only one will come to
live with them in Lagos. Adaku arrives with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) daughter, setting off tensions and
rivalry between the two women. As Nnu Ego tries to sleep nearby, Nnaife invokes his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
rights as a husband and has sexual relations with Adaku. Nnaife starts a new job
cutting grass for the railroad. With less space and more mouths to feed, Nnu Ego and
Adaku become pregnant around the same time. Nnu Ego gives birth to twin girls, while
Adaku's son dies shortly after he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is born. Feeling they are not being given enough
money to support the household, the women go on strike. Nnu Ego's firm resolve
eventually wavers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nnaife</b></font>) cooks a large conciliatory meal. But Nnaife does not come
home to enjoy it. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has been forced to join the army and is shipped off to India
and then Burma to fight in World War II. With Nnaife away and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pay partially secure in a savings account, Nnu Ego,
again pregnant, takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Nnaife</b></font>) family to Ibuza and to the deathbed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nnaife</b></font>) father. After
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) two funerals, Nnu Ego is unwilling to return to Lagos. However, Adankwo, the
eldest wife of Nnaife's older brother, urges her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to return to the city to keep an
eye on Adako. Nnu Ego returns to find that Nnaife had been home for a brief visit
and had left some money for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) failed to receive. Relations between Nnu
Ego and Adako grow increasingly strained, culminating in Nnu Ego's rude and brusque
treatment of one of Adako's visiting cousins. When Nnaife's friends step in to
resolve the conflict, Adako decides that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughters will move out on
their own. Impoverished once again, Nnu Ego spends the last of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) savings before
learning she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not been receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's yearly stipends due to an
institutional error. Nnaife returns and spends most of this windfall. Though Nnu Ego
is pregnant again, Nnaife decides to return to Ibuza, where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) impregnates Adankwo
and returns with a teenage bride, Okpo. Nnu Ego gives birth to twin girls. The family moves to a mud house in another part of town. First Oshia and then
Adim announce their intentions of furthering their educations. When Oshia tells
Nnaife he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has won a scholarship to study in the United States, Nnaife denounces him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dereliction of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) filial duty. Taiwo's marriage is arranged to an Ibo
clerk, but Kehinde runs away to marry a Yoruba. Hearing the news, Nnaife flies into
a rage and attempts to murder Kehinde's father-in-law with his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) cutlass. Nnaife is
put in jail, tried, and sentenced to five years, a stint that is reduced provided he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)
return to Ibuza after his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) release. Nnu Ego has also returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) homeland, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) dies several years later, alone by the roadside. Oshia returns to honor Nnu Ego
with a costly funeral, befitting her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) sacrifices as a mother.
