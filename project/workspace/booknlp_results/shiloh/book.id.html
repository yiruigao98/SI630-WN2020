Leroy Moffitt, Norma Jean's husband, was injured four months ago while driving his (<font color='blue'><b>Moffitt</b></font>) truck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moffitt</b></font>) wouldn't want to return to truck driving even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Moffitt</b></font>) could. To pass the time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moffitt</b></font>) constructs crafts and dreams of building a log cabin. Norma Jean supports herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) husband by working at a Rexall drugstore in the cosmetics department. Leroy is happy to be home and feels affectionate toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) wife, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) worries that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does not return these feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doesn't seem overjoyed about his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) constant presence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) wonders whether having him (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) around reminds her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of Randy, their son, who died as an infant. Leroy realizes that the death of a child drives many couples apart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) feels lucky that his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) marriage is intact. One night, Leroy buys marijuana from Stevie Hamilton, the son of a former schoolmate of Leroy's. Stevie's father is a well-to-do doctor. Leroy tries to make conversation about his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) plans to build a log cabin, but Stevie isn't interested. We learn that Leroy and Norma Jean, who are now thirty-four, got married when they were eighteen and had Randy a few months afterward. While the family was at a drive-in watching Dr. Strangelove, Randy died of SIDS -LRB-Sudden Infant Death Syndrome-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) was four months and three days old. When Leroy returns home, his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) mother-in-law, Mabel Beasley, is at the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) keeps tabs on the state of Norma Jean's laundry and plants. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) gives Norma Jean and Leroy a dust ruffle that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) made in the upholstery shop where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) works. Leroy jokes that they can use it to hide things. Mabel still resents him (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) for impregnating Norma Jean. Mabel makes fun of Leroy's Star Trek needlepoint pillow cover, calling sewing a woman's hobby. Leroy claims that football players sew and then explains his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) plans to build a cabin. Norma Jean says the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) needs to do is get a job. Mabel urges them to take a trip to Shiloh, the Civil War battlefield where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) late husband, who died when Norma Jean was a girl, went on their honeymoon. When Mabel leaves, Norma Jean presents Leroy with a list of possible jobs, including guarding, carpentering, and working in a lumberyard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) can't be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) feet all day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) does exactly that at Rexall's. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) speaks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) does leg exercises. Leroy reiterates his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) desire to build a cabin, but Norma Jean says she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) doesn't want to live in one. Norma Jean and Leroy used to have fun when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) came home from work, eating food that Norma Jean made, playing cards, and watching television. Now Norma Jean eats healthy cereal. This is one of the many small details that Leroy has learned about his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) wife now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>)'s been home. Leroy goes for pointless drives and looks around the new subdivisions. After one of these excursions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) arrives home and finds Norma Jean making a casserole and crying because Mabel found her (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) smoking. Leroy comforts her (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>). While he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) smokes a joint, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) plays <div class="bookquote">``Sunshine Superman''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Who'll Be the Next in Line?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>on the organ he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) for Christmas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) thinks about an old friend, Virgil, who organized a drug bust. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) mentions the cabin, and again Norma Jean dismisses the idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) longs to get to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) wife again but doesn't say anything. On Saturday, Mabel comes over and tells a story about a dachshund that killed a baby, claiming that the mother was neglectful. Leroy warns Mabel to watch what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) says. Afterward, Norma Jean says the story was meant to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) for smoking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) and Leroy are thinking about Randy, but neither of them says his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) name. Norma Jean enrolls in a composition class at night school. Leroy is defensive about his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) own English. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) starts cooking more exotic foods. Instead of playing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) organ, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) writes a paper about music. Leroy knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) will leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) and Mabel commiserate about the change in Norma Jean, and Mabel again suggests a trip to Shiloh. When Norma Jean arrives home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) is rude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) mother. That night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) tells Leroy that his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) name means the king. They go to Shiloh on Sunday. It looks like a park, not a golf course, as Leroy imagined. They see a log cabin. Close to the cemetery, they eat a picnic. Leroy feels nervous around his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) wife, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is an older woman and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) a bumbling boy. After they eat, Leroy smokes a joint. Silence falls, and Norma Jean says she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) wants to leave Leroy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) suggests starting over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) says they already did start over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) if it's a <div class="bookquote">``women's lib''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>issue. Norma says something changed when Mabel caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Norma</b></font>) smoking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norma</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Norma</b></font>) feels like she (<font color='blue'><b>Norma</b></font>)'s eighteen, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Norma</b></font>) hates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norma</b></font>) walks away. Leroy continues smoking and thinks about the war and the way it relates to Mabel's marriage and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) and Norma Jean's marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) has left a space in the middle of this history, just as there is a space in the middle of a log cabin, and a space in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) realizes that building a log cabin was a terrible idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) begins to follow Norma Jean, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) sees walking toward the Tennessee River. On the bluff, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) faces Leroy and moves her (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) arms in what could be a gesture to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) or an exercise for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jean</b></font>) pectoral muscles. The sky reminds Leroy of the dust ruffle that Mabel gave them.
