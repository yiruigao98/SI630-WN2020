Faith, wearing pink ribbons in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cap, asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feels scared when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is by herself and free to think troubling thoughts. Goodman Brown tells her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) must travel for one night only and reminds her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to say her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) prayers and go to bed early. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) reassures her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does this, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will come to no harm. Goodman Brown takes final leave of Faith, thinking to himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have guessed the evil purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) trip and promising to be a better person after this one night. Goodman Brown sets off on a road through a gloomy forest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) looks around, afraid of what might be behind each tree, thinking that there might be Indians or the devil himself lurking there. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) soon comes upon a man in the road who greets Goodman Brown as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had been expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>). The man is dressed in regular clothing and looks normal except for a walking stick he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carries. This walking stick features a carved serpent, which is so lifelike it seems to move. The man offers Goodman Brown the staff, saying that it might help him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) walk faster, but Goodman Brown refuses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) showed up for their meeting because he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) promised to do so but does not wish to touch the staff and wants to return to the village. Goodman Brown tells the man that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) family members have been Christians and good people for generations and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) feels ashamed to associate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>). The man replies that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew Goodman Brown's father and grandfather, as well as other members of churches in New England, and even the governor of the state. The man's words confuse Goodman Brown, who says that even if this is so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) wants to return to the village for Faith's sake. At that moment, the two come upon an old woman hobbling through the woods, and Goodman Brown recognizes Goody Cloyse, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) knows to be a pious, respected woman from the village. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) hides, embarrassed to be seen with the man, and the man taps Goody Cloyse on the shoulder. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) identifies him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as the devil and reveals herself to be a witch, on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way to the devil's evil forest ceremony. Despite this revelation, Goodman Brown tells the man that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) still intends to turn back, for Faith's sake. The man says that Goodman Brown should rest. Before disappearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) gives Goodman Brown his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) staff, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) can use it for transport to the ceremony if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) changes his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) mind. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) sits and gathers himself, Goodman Brown hears horses traveling along the road and hides once again. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) hears the voices of the minister of the church and Deacon Gookin, who are also apparently on their way to the ceremony. Shocked, Goodman Brown swears that even though everyone else in the world has gone to the devil, for Faith's sake he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) will stay true to God. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) soon hears voices coming from the ceremony and thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) recognizes Faith's voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) screams her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) name, and a pink ribbon from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) cap flutters down from the sky. Certain that there is no good in the world because Faith has turned to evil, Goodman Brown grabs the staff, which pulls him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) quickly through the forest toward the ceremony. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) reaches the clearing where the ceremony is taking place, the trees around it are on fire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) can see in the firelight the faces of various respected members of the community, along with more disreputable men and women and Indian priests. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) doesn't see Faith, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) starts to hope once again that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) might not be there. A figure appears on a rock and tells the congregation to present the converts. Goodman Brown thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) father beckoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) forward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) mother trying to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) back. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) can rethink his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) decision, the minister and Deacon Gookin drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Gookin</b></font>) forward. Goody Cloyse and Martha Carrier bring forth another person, robed and covered so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) identity is unknown. After telling the two that they have made a decision that will reveal all the wickedness of the world to them, the figure tells them to show themselves to each other. Goodman Brown sees that the other convert is Faith. Goodman Brown tells Faith to look up to heaven and resist the devil, then suddenly finds himself alone in the forest. The next morning Goodman Brown returns to Salem Village, and every person he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) passes seems evil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) sees the minister, who blesses him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>), and hears Deacon Gookin praying, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gookin</b></font>) refuses to accept the blessing and calls Deacon Gookin a wizard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gookin</b></font>) sees Goody Cloyse quizzing a young girl on Bible verses and snatches the girl away. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gookin</b></font>) sees Faith at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gookin</b></font>) own house and refuses to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). It's unclear whether the encounter in the forest was a dream, but for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gookin</b></font>) life, Goodman Brown is changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) doesn't trust anyone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) village, can't believe the words of the minister, and doesn't fully love his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) lives the remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) life in gloom and fear.
