After graduation, she works as a librarian at St. Paul for three years. She (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) meets Dr. Will Kennicott at a friend's house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) begins courting her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>). After courting for a year, they marry and move to Kennicott's hometown of Gopher Prairie. Disappointed by her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) first impression of the Gopher Prairie, Carol finds the town to be ugly and the townspeople to be provincial. The townspeople gossip all the time and are completely uninterested in cultural or social issues. Mrs. Bogart, the Kennicotts' neighbor, proves to be a religious hypocrite who idly gossips about everyone. However, Bea Sorenson arrives in Gopher Prairie on the same day as Carol. Awestruck by the magnificence of the town, which is larger than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) town has ever seen, Bea decides to stay and becomes Carol's maid. Carol refurbishes Kennicott's old-fashioned house with modern furniture and makes elaborate preparations for a party, a party unlike any party the town has ever seen. However, Carol discovers that the dull townspeople do not like change. Furthermore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) feels disheartened to learn that the townspeople constantly watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) every move and criticize her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) for being different from them. They criticize the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) dresses and the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) acts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) finds few friends in Gopher Prairie, except for the lawyer, Guy Pollock, and the high school teacher, Vida Sherwin. Carol also becomes friends with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) maid, Bea, and the town's handyman, Miles Bjornstam. While the townspeople treat Miles as an outcast because he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) supports socialism and the Democratic Party, Carol finds herself drawn to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>). Carol tries to get the people to build a new city hall, school, and library, and a more comfortable rest room for the farmer's wives. However, no one shares her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) interest in constructing new buildings or helping the town's poor. Everyone tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) that they do not want to spend money on unnecessary things like buildings. Carol idealizes Guy Pollock, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) shares her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) interest in reforming the town. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) eventually finds out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) does not care for social reform and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) has settled down to enjoy small town life. As Guy explains to Carol, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has the <div class="bookquote">``Village Virus.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Carol joins the Jolly Seventeen, the women's social club, and the Thanatopsis Club, the women's study group. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) tries to change the unimaginative club programs, the other members ignore her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) suggestions. Along with a group of friends, Carol forms a drama group and stages a play, which turns out to be horribly mediocre. Appointed to the library board, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) eagerly makes suggestions to how the library could encourage reading, but the local librarian opposes her (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) suggestions, preferring to discourage readers in order to keep the books clean. Carol and Kennicott have a bitter argument in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) of feeling superior to everyone else in town. After they make up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) begins to fall in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) all over again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) idealizes him (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) as a heroic doctor and witnesses him (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) amputating a farmer's arm one night. But life in Gopher Prairie continues to offer Carol no challenges. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) gives birth to a boy, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) names Hugh after her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) deceased father. Kennicott's aunt and uncle, the Smails, come to live in Gopher Prairie and prove a constant irritation to Carol. Meanwhile, Bea and Miles Bjornstam marry. The townspeople still shun Bjornstam and do not visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Bjornstam</b></font>) household. Unfortunately, Bea and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bea</b></font>) son Olaf die from typhoid. Heartbroken, Bjornstam leaves town, and the townspeople blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Bjornstam</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bjornstam</b></font>) family's deaths. Then, Carol's friend Vida Sherwin marries Raymond Wutherspoon, another local. When World War I breaks out, Raymond joins the army. Although Kennicott also wants to enlist, the medical council requests that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) stay in Gopher Prairie to provide his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) services. Erik Valborg, the son of a Swedish farmer, comes to Gopher Prairie to work as the tailor's assistant. Fern Mullins, a young teacher, also arrives in Gopher Prairie and boards in Mrs. Bogart's house. Carol finds the company of these two new residents stimulating because they share her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) love for books, music, dance, and drama. Cy Bogart, the leader of the town's gang of boys and Mrs. Bogart's son, ruins Fern's reputation when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) falsely accuses Fern of getting him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) drunk and making sexual advances on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). Forced to resign from the school, Fern leaves Gopher Prairie. Erik finds himself attracted to Carol and goes out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) for long walks. Kennicott knows about the close relationship between Erik and Carol but does not really mind because he (<font color='blue'><b>Erik</b></font>) knows that the two are only good friends who share the same intellectual interests. As Carol and Kennicott's marriage deteriorates, he (<font color='blue'><b>Erik</b></font>) begins an affair with Maud Dryer. However, after Fern leaves town, Kennicott decides that Carol and Erik should stop seeing each other in order to avoid another scandal. Erik leaves Gopher Prairie. Kennicott then decides to take Carol on a long tour of California in order to get away from the gossips in Gopher Prairie. When they return, Carol feels tired because the hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness of the people of Gopher Prairie has not changed at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) decides to leave and takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) son, Hugh, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>). Although Kennicott feels distressed when Carol leaves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) assures him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) will return someday. Carol moves to Washington, D.C., where she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) works for two years. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) enjoys the beautiful city, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) feels lonely in its largely anonymous crowds. Kennicott visits Carol in Washington and begins courting her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) for the second time. Recognizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) husband's love, Carol decides to return to Gopher Prairie. Carol's experience in Washington helps her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) acquire maturity and a new outlook toward life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) determines that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) can at least play a small role in changing life in Gopher Prairie. When Carol returns, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) accepts the small town and its people as they are. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) still fights small battles to make the town a better place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) gives birth to a daughter, hoping that the child will continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) fight. In the closing lines of the novel, while Carol talks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) struggle reform Gopher Prairie, Kennicott only half-listens to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carol</b></font>) and thinks only about the weather.
