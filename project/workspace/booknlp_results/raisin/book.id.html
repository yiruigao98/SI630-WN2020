a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, an African-American family
living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s.
When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check
for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased
Mr. Younger's life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of
the family has an idea as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Younger</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>Younger</b></font>) would like to do with
this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house
to fulfill a dream she (<font color='blue'><b>matriarch</b></font>) shared with her (<font color='blue'><b>matriarch</b></font>) husband. Mama's son, Walter
Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) believes that the investment will solve the family's
financial problems forever. Walter's wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama,
however, and hopes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) and Walter can provide more space and
opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter's sister
and Mama's daughter, wants to use the money for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) medical school
tuition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) also wishes that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) family members were not so interested
in joining the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) identity
by looking back to the past and to Africa. As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their
competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) is pregnant but fears
that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) has the child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) will put more financial pressure
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth's admission
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a
house for the whole family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) believes that a bigger, brighter
dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an
entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers' future neighbors
find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner,
from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers
money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal,
even after Walter loses the rest of the money -LRB-$6,500-RRB-
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the
liquor store and then runs off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) cash. In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) suitor, George Murchison, whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently,
she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) receives a marriage proposal from her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph
Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) -LRB-Beneatha does not make her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) choice before the end of the
play-RRB-. The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling
the family's long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly
dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better
life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together
as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer.
