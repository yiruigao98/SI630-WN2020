Pearl's mother, Winnie Louie, has called Pearl up to request that Pearl ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) daughters to attend the engagement party of Pearl's cousin Bao-Bao in San Francisco. Right away, Pearl feels a reluctance to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) mother, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) is more involved in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) American identity--perhaps a result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) marriage to Phil, an American--than her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) Chinese background. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) feels an obligation to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) families' festivity and knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) would feel guilty otherwise. Then, two days before the engagement party, Pearl receives another call from her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) mother telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) that Auntie Du has died and that the funeral will be arranged for the day after the engagement party. So, with all of this on her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) shoulders, Pearl sets out toward San Francisco with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) young daughters, Tessa and Cleo, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) husband. Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) childhood home, Pearl's Auntie Helen, Bao-Bao's mother, who co-owns a flower shop with Pearl's mother, pulls Pearl aside and makes a request. Auntie Helen tells Pearl that Pearl must tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) mother Winnie about Pearl's multiple sclerosis, which everyone in the family knows about, except for Winnie. Helen says that Pearl must do this because Helen believes that Helen has a malignant brain tumor and does not want to die knowing that Winnie does not know this about her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) daughter. Helen continues by saying that if Winnie will not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) mother the truth, Helen will be forced to do so herself. Later, Helen pulls Winnie's mother aside as well and tells Winnie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) must unveil the secrets of her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) past to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) daughter because she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) cannot go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) grave with such secrets. We find out later that Helen knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) tumor is benign and is simply using the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own death as a pretext to force mother and daughter to unleash their secrets. It is at this point that the novel changes narrative voices and begins to be narrated by Winnie Louie, who begins to tell Pearl the story of Winnie's past. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) reached the United States, Winnie experienced much turmoil, strife, and suffering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) was abandoned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) mother as a young child, never knowing very much about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's mysterious disappearance. Winnie, whose name in China was Weili, is forced to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) Uncle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) two wives -LRB-New Aunt and Old Aunt-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) never feels as loved as her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) uncle's true daughter, Weili's cousin, Peanut. Nevertheless, when the time comes, Winnie's aunts arrange a traditional marriage for her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) father provides a large dowry, since he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is an educated and well-established man. The marriage, however, to a man named Wen Fu, turns out to be a terrible one. Wen Fu is horribly abusive--physically, mentally, and emotionally. Winnie manages to suffer through her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) manage while surviving World War II. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) loses many children along the way, some to early deaths and one that was stillborn. It is during the War that Winnie becomes friends with Helen, whose name in China was Hulan. By telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) daughter about this friendship, Winnie is revealing that Helen and Winnie are not really in-laws as the family in America believes, but only friends who have gone through much hardship together. Winnie had had to lie and say that Helen was her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) dead brother's first wife in order to bring Helen to the United States, after Winnie had already been in the United States for a while. Winnie lived her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) new husband Jimmy Louie, the man whom Pearl had always been told was her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) father. Jimmie Louie was a good husband, a good father, and a minister in the Chinese Baptist Church, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) had died when Pearl was a teenager. Winnie had met Jimmy Louie in China, at an American dance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) was American born, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) background was Chinese, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Louie</b></font>) was extremely kind. The two fell in love, and Pearl escaped with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>), after running away from Wen Fu. The biggest secret, however, that Winnie tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) daughter, is that before Winnie was able to escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) marriage, Wen Fu raped her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) and that Wen Fu is Pearl's real father. Winnie tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) daughter also that it is only now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) feels truly free from Wen Fu's wickedness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fu</b></font>) threats, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) has received news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fu</b></font>) death. After Winnie tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) daughter about her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) past, Pearl reveals the secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) own disease. By the time the wedding of Bao-Bao comes around, mother and daughter know each other better and are able to appreciate each other's positions, ideas, and beliefs better. Also, by the end of the novel, Helen reveals the planning of a trip to China--a trip that Helen, Pearl, and Winnie will take together.
