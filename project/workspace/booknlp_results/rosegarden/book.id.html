Deborah Blau, bright and artistically talented, has created a world, the Kingdom of Yr, as a form of defense from a confusing, frightening reality. When Deborah was five, she (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) underwent surgery to remove a tumor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) ovaries, a traumatic experience that involved a great deal of physical pain and shame. During her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) childhood, Deborah suffered frequent abuse from her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) anti-Semitic peers and neighbors. When Deborah first created Yr, it was a beautiful, comforting haven, but over time the gods of Yr became tyrannical dictators who ruled Deborah's every word and action. The novel presents the issue of mental illness from multiple viewpoints. Deborah's three years in the hospital provide us with a portrait of mental illness as it is experienced by the patient. Deborah's parents, Esther and Jacob, are torn between their love for their daughter and their shame at the stigma of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) illness. Nevertheless, they find the courage to allow Deborah to continue treatment even when there are few signs of recovery for a long while. Deborah struggles with guilt and resentment at her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) parents' disappointed expectations for her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) while her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) younger sister Suzy copes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Suzy</b></font>) frustration at having to arrange her (<font color='blue'><b>Suzy</b></font>) life around Deborah's illness. Deborah's strong-willed, empathetic, brilliant therapist, Clara Fried, slowly wins Deborah's trust. She (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) never forces Deborah to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) point of view. Over the course of three years, she (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) helps Deborah gain the courage to fight her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) illness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) goal is to give Deborah the ability to choose between the reality of Earth, despite all its faults and problems, over the phantoms of Yr. Meanwhile, Deborah develops friendships of a kind with the other patients in the hospital despite their fear of emotional investment in other people. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) fears the reality of Earth, Deborah eventually earns a GED and resolves to win her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) struggle against her (<font color='blue'><b>Deborah</b></font>) illness.
