Sammy, a young man working the checkout line, watches them closely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) appraises their looks and notes even minute details about the way they carry themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) also speculates about their personalities and their motivation for entering the store dressed the way they are. Sammy is particularly interested in the most attractive girl, who appears to be the leader of the group. This girl, whom Sammy dubs <div class="bookquote">``Queenie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sammy</b></font>)</div>has a natural grace and confidence, in addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queenie</b></font>) beauty. As the girls roam the aisles of the A&P, they create a stir. As Sammy points out, the store is in the center of town, nowhere near the beach, where the girls' attire would attract less notice. Sammy's coworker Stokesie ogles the girls as well, joking around with Sammy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) does so. Sammy jokes along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) feels the contrast between himself, still single, and the married Stokesie. Stokesie is resigned to a life of working at the A&P, whereas Sammy, although admitting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) and Stokesie are much alike, seems to feel that such a future is beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>). As yet another of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) coworkers begins to admire the girls, Sammy feels a twinge of pity for them for having compromised themselves this way, most likely without realizing it. This feeling is quickly supplanted by pure excitement as the girls choose Sammy's checkout line to make their purchase. Lengel, the store manager, approaches Sammy's checkout lane. Lengel chastises the girls for entering the store in bathing suits, citing store policy. The girls are embarrassed, and Queenie protests that her (<font color='blue'><b>Queenie</b></font>) mother wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Queenie</b></font>) to come in and buy some herring snacks. In this statement, Sammy gleans insight into Queenie's life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) imagines her (<font color='blue'><b>Queenie</b></font>) parents at a party, everyone dressed nicely and sipping <div class="bookquote">``drinks the color of water.''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) thinks about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) own parents' parties, where people drink lemonade or cheap beer. As the girls begin to leave the store, Sammy suddenly turns to Lengel and quits his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) job, protesting the way Lengel has embarrassed the girls. Sammy hopes the girls are watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>). Lengel tries to talk Sammy out of quitting, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) will regret the decision later and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) quitting will disappoint his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) parents. Sammy, however, feels that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) must see the gesture through to its conclusion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) exits the A&P. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) reaches the parking lot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) sees that the girls are long gone. Sammy is left alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) ambiguous feelings and a growing sense of foreboding about what life has in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>).
