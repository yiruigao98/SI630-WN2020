The first story or section, <div class="bookquote">``Franny,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was published in the New Yorker in January 1955. In <div class="bookquote">``Franny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Franny</b></font>)</div>Franny Glass meets her boyfriend Lane Coutell for a football weekend at his (<font color='blue'><b>Franny</b></font>) college. They do not get to join many of the festivities, though, because during their first lunch together, Franny begins to have a breakdown. She (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) tells Lane that she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) is sick of the phoniness at school and of the egotism of the faculty. She (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) has quit the play she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) was in because she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) is embarrassed about what she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) feels to be acting fake. As she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) gets worked up, she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) has become interested in the <div class="bookquote">``Jesus prayer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>a continuous prayer meant to cleanse one's spirit. Lane mostly brushes off Franny's concerns until she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) faints on the way to the bathroom. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Franny</b></font>) is helping to revive her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) begins to speak the prayer. <div class="bookquote">``Zooey''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>basically picks up where <div class="bookquote">``Franny''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>left off. First, though, the narrator names himself. The man claiming to be the author of the story is Buddy Glass, one of Franny and Zooey's older brothers. The story resumes. It is the Monday after the weekend Franny's breakdown started, and Zooey is at home in New York City. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Franny</b></font>) conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Franny</b></font>) mother, Bessie Glass, it is revealed that Franny is now at home, sleeping and crying on the living room sofa. Bessie wants Zooey to talk to Franny, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Franny</b></font>) eventually does. The two of them have a long theological and personal discussion. We learn that the two of them have basically been raised on a blend of different religions, taught to them by their older brothers Buddy and Seymour. Over the course of this long discussion, Zooey helps Franny sort out her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) spiritual and personal beliefs, allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>), by the end, to find peace.
