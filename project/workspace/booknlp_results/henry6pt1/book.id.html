Several messengers arrive, announcing trouble in France. Several towns, part of the English territory once won by Henry V, have been lost, the Dauphin Charles has been crowned king, while the English hero Talbot has been taken prisoner. Hearing the news, the noblemen rise to action, each taking on a different task to help reorganize the kingdom and prepare the newly crowned king--the former king's son, Henry VI--for his (<font color='blue'><b>VI</b></font>) emergency duties in France. Talbot's forces lay siege to Orléans, while Charles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lords try to fight their way out. Yet the English, although exhausted and starving, still beat them. The Bastard of Orléans brings Joan to meet Charles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) has seen visions and can lead the troops. Charles challenges her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) to single combat and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) beats him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) assures the French that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) will break the siege that very day. In London, the Protector of the kingdom, Gloucester, who will rule until the young king is old enough to take over, comes to blows with the leader of the church, Winchester, at the Tower of London. Winchester bars Gloucester from entering the Tower and accuses him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) of plotting to take over the kingdom. Their serving men join in the fight, but soon the Mayor arrives to split them up. In France, Talbot has been released in exchange for a captured French lord. The French launch an attack on the English forces, killing important leaders. Talbot and Joan fight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) gains the upper hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) says it is not his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) time to die, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>). Joan succeeds in lifting the siege, and the French nobles celebrate her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) successes. Yet Talbot engineers a sneak attack on Orléans and retakes the city, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) can bury his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) dead comrades within the city. The Countess of Auvergne sends for Talbot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) wants to see this renowned man in person. Talbot goes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) castle, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) now declares he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) has fallen into her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) trap. But Talbot laughs, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) is not as small as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) looks. Rather, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) is just one part of a great army that will never be trapped. His (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) soldiers arrive instantly. Back in London many lords gather in the Temple Garden outside Parliament to dispute a point of law. Richard Plantagenet and Somerset form the heads of opposing camps, and they pluck white and red roses as symbols of their differing opinions. Their followers do the same. Somerset insults Plantagenet's father and they each scorn each other. Warwick predicts that the argument, though begun over something so small, will end in the deaths of thousands. Plantagenet goes to the Tower of London to talk to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) uncle Mortimer and to ask about his (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) father. Mortimer says Plantagenet's father was once in line to the throne and had raised an army to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) claim his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) right to power, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) was captured and executed, while the rest of the Mortimer line, including this Mortimer, was suppressed. Mortimer dies, leaving Plantagenet even more anxious to regain his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) birthright. All of Parliament soon learns of Gloucester and Winchester's dispute when their serving men crash into the room pelting each other with stones. King Henry urges them not to fight, for civil dissention will weaken the nation. The two men promise to stop fighting for the moment. Warwick presents Plantagenet's request to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) father's title passed on to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>). The king grants it, also giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) uncle's former title, and, thus, renaming him (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) the Duke of York. Gloucester urges the king to go to France to deal with the unrest there, and Henry agrees. Exeter comments on the growing factionalism resulting from the noblemen's quarrels--that of Gloucester and Winchester and that of Plantagenet -LRB-now York-RRB- and Somerset--and refe rs to a prophecy stating that Henry VI would lose all the territories that his (<font color='blue'><b>VI</b></font>) father had won for Britain. Talbot's forces stand outside Rouen, prepared to attack. The French and English forces insult each other repeatedly. Talbot asks the French to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) in the field and fight a fair fight rather than using their walled city to their advantage, but they refuse. The English forces manage to beat the French forces anyway. Joan tells Charles not to worry about the loss, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) has a new plan to weaken Talbot. Burgundy, a French leader fighting with Talbot, constitutes the only threat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) plan, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) lures him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) to the French camp and convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>)'s fighting for the wrong side. Henry arrives in Paris with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nobles. Talbot goes to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>), where he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) receives a message from Burgundy about his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) change of loyalty. Talbot goes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) forces to try to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>). Meanwhile two underlings of York and Somerset ask the king for the right to have an armed fight. This is the first the King learns of the struggle between the followers of the white rose and the red rose. The king urges Somerset and York to put aside their differences while they are in France, for their dissention will make Britain appear weak to its enemy. The king says it shouldn't matter what rose he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wears, since he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) loves both his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lords--yet even as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) says this he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) picks Somerset's red rose. York is upset but he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) keeps it to himself. Henry assigns the two men to new tasks in France, making York the leader of the English troops and putting Somerset in charge of the cavalry. Talbot prepares to attack Bordeaux, but the city is well defended and Charles' forces approach from behind: he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) is trapped! A messenger from Talbot asks York to send the cavalry reinforcements to save Talbot, but York has no troops to send. Convinced Somerset has delayed the delivery of the cavalry out of dislike for him (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>), York bemoans the imminent death of Talbot and the loss of the lands hard won by Henry V. The same messenger goes to Somerset, who says York is to blame for sending Talbot into battle without sufficient troops and that York probably did so knowingly, wanting to take over Talbot's post. The messenger says Somerset should have helped Talbot, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) death will be both noblemen's shame. Talbot's son John arrives on the battlefield, having come to learn about soldiering from his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) father. But Talbot tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) has arrived at a terrible moment and urges him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) to flee rather than die in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) first battle. But John refuses, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will disgrace the honor of the Talbot name if he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) flees. The battle begins, and John is wounded; yet still he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will not flee. Finally, John is killed and Talbot dies of grief. The English army is defeated. Back in London, Gloucester reads letters from the pope urging the English to make peace with the French. Charles agrees to make an offer. Meanwhile in France, Charles' forces are under attack by the united front of Somerset and York. Joan calls to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) patron-demons to advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) about the future, but they refuse to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>). York captures Joan in battle. In the course of the battles, Suffolk has captured Margaret, a French girl, daughter to one of Charles' nobles, René. Impressed with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beauty, he (<font color='blue'><b>René</b></font>) wants to woo her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>René</b></font>) is already married. So he (<font color='blue'><b>René</b></font>) decides to woo her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for Henry and asks René if he (<font color='blue'><b>René</b></font>) will consent to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marriage to the English king. York and Warwick hold Joan in trial. They ask if it is true that her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) father was a shepherd, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) refuses to acknowledge this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) tries to convince them that they should not kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) is a virgin and, thus, able in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) purity to communicate with powers on high; they will incur a heavenly wrath if they execute her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>). York and Warwick nonetheless prepare to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) burnt at the stake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) now suddenly claims that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) is pregnant and they wouldn't dare kill a pregnant woman, but York tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) that no matter what she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) says, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) will die. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) curses the English and is led away. Meanwhile, Winchester tries to engineer peace between Charles and the English. At first, Charles resists, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) nobles advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to accept the peace for the moment in order to stop the massacre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) citizens; they can always break the treaty later. Suffolk arrives in London and tells the king of Margaret's charms. Henry decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), but Gloucester reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is already engaged to the daughter of a relative of Charles, a match that would soothe international politics. Margaret's father Rene is only a minor earl with no money and, thus, a union with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would offer no real advantages. Yet Henry insists on marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and tells Gloucester he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must simply forgive his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) choice. Suffolk has succeeded; now Margaret will rule the king and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will rule Margaret.
