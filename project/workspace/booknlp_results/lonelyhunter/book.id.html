Antonapoulos works in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hunter</b></font>) cousin's fruit store, and Singer works as a silver engraver in a jewelry shop. They spend ten years living together in this way. One day Antonapoulos gets sick, and even after he (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) recovers he (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) is a changed man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) begins stealing and urinating on buildings, and exhibiting other erratic behavior. Finally, Antonapoulos's cousin sends him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to a mental asylum, although Singer would rather have Antonapoulos stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>). After Antonapoulos leaves, Singer moves into a local boarding house in town run by a family named the Kellys. The narrator then introduces us to Biff Brannon, the proprietor of the New York Café, the establishment in town where Singer now eats all his (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) meals. Biff is lounging on the counter watching a new patron named Jake Blount, as the constantly drunk Jake is intriguing. Blount goes over and sits with Singer and begins talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) as though the two are good friends. Then Singer leaves. Once Jake realizes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) drunken stupor that Singer has left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) goes into an alley and begins beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) head and fists against a brick wall until he (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) is bruised and bloody. The police bring Jake back to the café, and Singer volunteers to let the drunk stay the night with him (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>). The narrative shifts to the perspective of Mick Kelly, the young teenage daughter of the couple who own the boarding house where Singer is staying. Mick spends her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) summer days looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) two younger brothers, Bubber and Ralph. Mick is passionate about music, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tries to make a violin out of a ukulele and strings from various different instruments. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is frustrated when her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) attempt fails. The narrative switches to Blount's point of view. Jake applies for and lands a job as a mechanic at a local carnival. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) tries to tell some workers about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) socialist ideas on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) way home, but they laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) soothes himself by going back to John Singer's place, talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) and drinking. Then the narrative switches to Dr. Copeland's perspective. Dr. Copeland is a black physician in town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) is angered by a story his (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) daughter, Portia, tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) about a scam artist who took lots of black people's money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) wishes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) children had grown up to be well-educated, successful leaders for the black race rather than accepting the traditional, demeaning, menial jobs that are usually available to blacks in the South at this time. Dr. Copeland remembers a night when John Singer lit a cigarette for him (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>)--the first time the Doctor has experienced an act of courtesy from a white man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) entire life. By the end of Part One, Mick, Biff, Jake, and Dr. Copeland have all begun to visit Singer regularly, all taking comfort in him (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) as a confidant. At the opening of Part Two, Mick throws a party with kids from school. During the party, she (<font color='blue'><b>confidant</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>confidant</b></font>) neighbor Harry Minowitz take a stroll around the block. Harry, a Jewish boy, tells Mick how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Mick</b></font>) hates the Nazis. Later that night, Mick, hiding in the bushes outside a house in the rich neighborhood, overhears on the radio a Beethoven symphony for the first time. She (<font color='blue'><b>confidant</b></font>) is very moved by it. Biff's wife, Alice, dies after surgery to remove a tumor. Biff is not overly sad about it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) and Alice had fallen out of love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) sister-in- law, Lucile Wilson, and Lucile's daughter. Baby, come over to talk to Biff before they go to the funeral. Biff tells Lucile that once he (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) beat up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>) ex-husband, Leroy, because Leroy had been bragging about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>). The three of them then set off for the funeral. Dr. Copeland's youngest son, Willie, is convicted of attempted manslaughter after getting in a fight at a strip club. Willie and is sent to prison. Dr. Copeland starts to feel ill, and soon discovers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) has tuberculosis of the lungs. A few days later, Portia invites Dr. Copeland to come to a family reunion at her (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) house, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) estranged older sons Buddy and Hamilton, as well as Grandpapa -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) father-in-law-RRB- are going to be in town. Jake Blount tells Singer about his (<font color='blue'><b>Blount</b></font>) socialist beliefs and about the books by Marx and Veblen he (<font color='blue'><b>Marx</b></font>) has read. Blount tells Singer how badly he (<font color='blue'><b>Blount</b></font>) wants to tell all workers about the evils of capitalism, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blount</b></font>) wants to stage a revolution that will result in a more equitable division of labor and profit. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Blount</b></font>) way home, Jake sees a quote from the Bible written on a wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) writes underneath the quote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) wants to meet the man who wrote it, but the man never shows up. One day, when Mick is sitting out on the front steps with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marx</b></font>) brother Bubber, Bubber accidentally shoots Baby Wilson in the head with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) friend's BB gun. Baby has to be rushed to the hospital, and the six-year-old Bubber feels so bad about the event that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) tries to run away from home. Mick and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marx</b></font>) family find Bubber wandering along the road, trying to hitch a ride to Atlanta. Dr. Copeland throws his (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) customary Christmas party at his (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) house. Once the guests are assembled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) delivers a powerful speech about the importance of education for black people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) also tells the guests about Karl Marx, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Marx</b></font>) believes was a great writer and thinker. Dr. Copeland feels happy knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) is helping his (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) people toward achieving justice, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) later worries that his (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) guests will not remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) words for long. Singer misses Antonapoulos terribly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) writes his (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) friend a letter telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) about the four visitors who come to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) all the time. Then Singer takes a few days off from work and goes to the mental hospital to see Antonapoulos, who is now sick with nephritis. Singer gives his (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) friend a moving picture machine for Christmas. Biff Brannon redecorates his (<font color='blue'><b>Brannon</b></font>) bedroom after Alice's death, and one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannon</b></font>) finds some old perfume of hers and begins wearing it. Lucile and Baby come to eat at the café; Baby is still bald from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>) surgery and more ill-tempered than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>) was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>) accident. Biff realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) wishes Mick and Baby could be his (<font color='blue'><b>Mick</b></font>) own children. Mick begins to write music in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>) spare time. Songs come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>) head and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>) writs them down in a notebook she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>) hides beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>) bed in a hatbox. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucile</b></font>) and Harry Minowitz make plans to kill Hitler. One day during a wrestling match Mick and Harry suddenly feel attracted to one another, but nothing happens. Dr. Copeland and Portia have note heard from Willie in six weeks. Finally Portia receives word that Willie was punished because one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) friends was rude to a prison guard. Willie was tied up and locked in a cold room for three days; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) was let out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) feet were gangrenous and had to be cut off. Dr. Copeland goes to the courthouse to talk to a white judge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) knows, but a racist sheriff picks a fight with the Doctor, beats him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and throws him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in jail. Mick and Harry Minowitz decide to take a bike trip to a lake to go swimming because the weather has gotten so hot. They end up having sex, and Harry is very upset about it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is afraid his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother will be able to tell what has happened. Harry tells Mick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is going to leave town, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will write to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) once he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has found work to make sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is doing alright. Jake Blount meets the man who wrote the quote from the Bible on the brick wall; the man's name is Simms, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Simms</b></font>) preaches on the sidewalks. Simms starts coming to preach at the carnival where Jake works, and Jake occasionally makes fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>). One day, Jake goes to see Singer, who is just returning from seeing Dr. Copeland. Singer tells Blount the news about Willie's feet. Jake says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) would like to try to help Willie, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) and Singer go to Portia's house, where Willie is staying. Jake gets drunker and drunker during the visit, and neither Portia nor Willie wants Jake to get involved in Willie's incident because they think it will just lead to more trouble. Jake accidentally stumbles into the room where Dr. Copeland is lying in bed recovering, and the two men get into a heated debate about Marxism and the best way to take action to change society. Despite their seemingly similar ideologies, the two men get in an argument and Blount storms out. Mick takes a job at Woolworth's to help support her (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) family, but then wonders if she (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) has made a bad choice, realizing she (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) will likely have to drop out of high school. Mick visits Singer and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Mick</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mick</b></font>) thinks it a good idea to take the job. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mick</b></font>) nods in assent, Mick feels reassured. Singer then sets off to see Antonapoulos once again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mick</b></font>) brings many wrapped gifts with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mick</b></font>) along with a fruit basket and a basket of strawberries. However, when Singer arrives, the orderly tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) that Antonapoulos has died. The shocked Singer wanders about listlessly, returns home on the train, goes to work the next day, and shoots himself in the chest when he (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) gets back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) room in the evening. In Part Three of the novel, we briefly see snapshots of the four main characters on a day not long after Singer's death. Dr. Copeland is sent to live on Grandpapa's farm--a move the Doctor does not want to make but about which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) has no choice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is too sick to take care of himself anymore. Dr. Copeland feels that his (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) life purpose--striving to attain justice for the black people--is an unfinished failure. Jake Blount is angry that Singer has died, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) himself has spent much of the last year confiding in a man who is now dead. Blount tries to find Dr. Copeland to make amends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Copeland</b></font>) after their previous argument, but Portia tells Blount that Dr. Copeland has already left for Grandpapa's. Jake decides to take the next train out of town to try and start anew somewhere else. Mick Kelly has decided to continue working at Woolworth's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) does not understand why Singer killed himself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) tries not to let it bother her (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) too much anymore. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) reflects that lately she (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) has not had any time or energy to write music, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) nonetheless resolves to start saving for a little piano. Even though nobody forced Mick to take the job at Woolworth's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) feels cheated. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) still maintains optimism and resolves to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) plans. Biff Brannon keeps on working at the New York Café, pondering the patrons as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannon</b></font>) always has. At the café late that night, Biff thinks that Singer's death is a riddle that will remain a mystery for a long time. Biff experiences a brief epiphany about the meaning of life, and then prepares himself to greet the approaching day.
