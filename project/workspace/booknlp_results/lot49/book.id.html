One day, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) receives a letter from a law firm telling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ex-boyfriend, Pierce Inverarity, has died and named her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the executor of his (<font color='blue'><b>executor</b></font>) estate. Oedipa resolves to faithfully execute her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) duty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) travels to San Narciso -LRB-Pierce's hometown-RRB- where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) meets the lawyer, Metzger, assigned to help her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spontaneously begins an affair. As they go about sorting through Pierce's tangled financial affairs, Oedipa takes note of the fact that Pierce owned an extensive stamp collection. One night, Oedipa and Metzger go to a bar called The Scope, where they meet Mike Fallopian, a member of a right-wing fanatical organization called the Peter Pinguid Society. In the bathroom of the bar, Oedipa sees a symbol that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) later learns is supposed to represent a muted post horn. Written below the symbol are the acronym W.A.S.T.E. and the name <div class="bookquote">``Kirby.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oedipa</b></font>)</div>Oedipa makes a note of all this info before returning to chat with Mike at the bar. Oedipa and Metzger take a trip one day to Fangoso Lagoons, an area in which Pierce owned a substantial amount of land. There, they meet a man named Manny di Presso, a lawyer who is suing the Inverarity estate on behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>Manny</b></font>) client, who recovered and sold human bones to Inverarity but did not receive proper payment. Pierce wanted the bones to make charcoal for cigarette filters. A member of The Paranoids, a hippie band that follows Oedipa around, points out that Manny's story is similar to that of the 17th-century play The Courier's Tragedy. Oedipa and Metzger decide to see a production of the play nearby. The play mentions the word <div class="bookquote">``Tristero,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>a word that fascinates Oedipa because of its placement within the play. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) goes backstage to speak with the director, Randolph Driblette, who tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) to stop overanalyzing the play. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) resolves to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) back later. After rereading Pierce's will later on, Oedipa goes to a stockholders' meeting for the Yoyodyne company, a firm owned in part by Inverarity. After taking a brief tour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) stumbles into the office of Stanley Koteks, who is drawing the muted post horn symbol on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) pad of paper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stanley</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) about a scientist named John Nefastis who has built a type of Mexwell's Demon, or a physically impossible machine that allows for perpetual motion by violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Koteks encourages Oedipa to meet with Nefastis. Wanting to learn more about The Courier's Tragedy, Oedipa gets an anthology of Jacobean revenge plays. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) notices that the paperback copy has no mention of the Tristero, however, which puzzles her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) decides to go to Berkeley to meet with the publisher. In the meantime, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) stops by an elderly care home that Pierce had owned, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) meets an old man with a ring depicting the muted post horn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) also hires a philatelist -LRB-stamp expert-RRB- named Genghis Cohen to go through Pierce's stamp collection. After doing so, Genghis tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) that some of Pierce's stamps have a muted post horn in their watermark. Oedipa begins to realize that she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) is uncovering a large mystery. Oedipa goes to Berkeley to meet with John Nefastis, who shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Nefastis</b></font>) perpetual motion machine. It can only be operated by people with special mental capabilities allowing them to communicate with the machine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nefastis</b></font>) tells Oedipa that she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) has no such mental skills. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nefastis</b></font>) then propositions her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>), causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) to run out screaming. Oedipa then begins a very, very long night of wandering around aimlessly all over the Bay area. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) encounters the muted post horn symbol almost everywhere, leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) may be hallucinating. Just before dawn, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) encounters an old man who hands her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) a letter and asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) to deliver it via W.A.S.T.E. under the freeway. After helping the man to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room, Oedipa finds a W.A.S.T.E. facility under the freeway, drops in the letter and waits for the delivery man, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) follows to Oakland and back to Berkeley after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picks up the letters and delivers them. Oedipa returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) home in Kinneret to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) doctor, who begins shooting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) pulls up. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has gone crazy, obsessed with the idea that Israelis are coming to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) assisted the Nazis in World War II. After he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is arrested, Oedipa sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) husband, Mucho, and spends some time with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), although she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) quickly sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has become addicted to LSD, making it difficult to communicate effectively. Increasingly alone, Oedipa seeks out Emory Bortz, an English professor at San Narciso College who has extensive knowledge of Jacobean revenge plays. With his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) help, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) pieces together the history of the Tristero, which dates back to mid-16th-century Europe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) learns that Driblette has died, which means she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) will never know why he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) included the lines about the Tristero in his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) production of The Courier's Tragedy -LRB-these lines are not ordinarily included in the play-RRB-. Oedipa begins to give up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) is very lonely and has no real friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) visits Mike Fallopian again, who suggests that the whole Tristero mystery may be nothing more than a huge, complex joke played on her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) by Pierce. Oedipa will not accept this possibility but realizes that every route leading to the Tristero also leads to the Inverarity Estate. Meanwhile, Genghis Cohen helps her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) piece together some mysteries about Pierce's stamp collection, which is to be auctioned off by a local dealer as Lot 49. Genghis has heard that a secretive bidder will attend the auction to bid on Lot 49, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Genghis</b></font>) will not reveal himself beforehand. Oedipa goes to the auction, excited to find out who the bidder is, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Genghis</b></font>) may know the key to the Tristero. The novel ends as Oedipa sits in the room waiting for the crying of Lot 49, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipa</b></font>) will discover the identity of the mystery bidder.
