The heroine, who remains nameless, lives in Europe with her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) husband, Maxim de Winter, traveling from hotel to hotel, harboring memories of a beautiful home called Manderley, which, we learn, has been destroyed by fire. The story begins with her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) memories of how she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) and Maxim first met, in Monte Carlo, years before. In her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) flashback, the heroine is working as the young traveling companion to a wealthy American named Mrs. Van Hopper. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Hopper</b></font>) flashback, Maxim is staying at the same hotel as the heroine and her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) employer, and after knowing the heroine for only a few weeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxim</b></font>) proposes marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) accepts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxim</b></font>) marries her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) and takes her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxim</b></font>) ancestral estate of Manderley. But a dark cloud hangs over their marriage: Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, drowned in a cove near Manderley the previous year, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) ghost haunts the newlyweds' home. Rebecca's devoted housekeeper, the sinister Mrs. Danvers, is still in charge of Manderley, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Danvers</b></font>) frightens and intimidates her (<font color='blue'><b>Danvers</b></font>) new mistress. Despite the encouragement of the house overseer, Frank Crawley, and Maxim's sister, Beatrice, the heroine struggles in her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) new life at Manderley. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) feels that she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) can never compare favorably to Rebecca, who was beautiful, talented, and brilliant--or so everyone says--and soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) feels that Maxim is still in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>Maxim</b></font>) dead wife. Manderley traditionally hosts a costume ball each year, and it is soon time for the gala to take place. Swept up in the preparations, the heroine's spirits begin to revive. But the ball ends in disaster: on Mrs. Danvers's suggestion she (<font color='blue'><b>Danvers</b></font>) wears a costume that, it turns out, is the same dress that Rebecca wore at the last ball. Upon seeing the heroine, Maxim is horrified, and the heroine becomes convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxim</b></font>) will never love her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxim</b></font>) is still devoted to Rebecca. The following day, Mrs. Danvers almost convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Danvers</b></font>) to kill herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Danvers</b></font>) only breaks away from the old woman's spell when rockets go off over the cove, signaling that a ship has run aground. When divers swim near the grounded ship, they find the wreckage of Rebecca's sailboat, with Rebecca's dead body in the hold. This discovery prompts Maxim to tell the heroine the truth: Rebecca was a malevolent, wicked woman, who lived a secret life and carried on multiple affairs, including one with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) cousin, Jack Favell. On the night of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) death, Maxim had demanded a divorce, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) had refused, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Maxim</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) was pregnant with Favell's child. Furious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maxim</b></font>) seized a gun and shot her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>), and then sailed out to the harbor in Rebecca's boat and sank it, with the body stowed safely inside. This revelation restores the heroine's marriage, and enables her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) to finally shake off the burden of Rebecca's ghost. Meanwhile, however, the noose of justice tightens around Maxim: first, it is found that holes have been drilled in the bottom of Rebecca's boat; luckily the coroner delivers a report of suicide, rather than murder. But soon Rebecca's cousin Favell, certain that Rebecca did not kill herself, accuses Maxim of the crime. The local magistrate, Colonel Julyan, investigates, and finds that on the day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) death, Rebecca went up to London to see a Doctor Baker. Favell, Maxim, and the heroine accompany Julyan to London; the heroine is certain that Baker will reveal that Rebecca was pregnant, thus revealing Maxim's vengeful motive for murder. But instead, it turns out that Rebecca was dying of cancer, and that furthermore she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) was infertile; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) had lied to Maxim about her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) pregnancy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) terminal illness now supplies a motive for Rebecca's supposed suicide, and Maxim is saved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maxim</b></font>) and the heroine drive all night back to Manderley, stopping only once, when Maxim calls home and learns that Mrs. Danvers has disappeared. As they crest the ridge near the mansion, they look down and find it in flames.
