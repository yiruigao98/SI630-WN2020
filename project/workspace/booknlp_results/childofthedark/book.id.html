Jesus, covers the period between July 1955 and January 1, 1960, with a gap, due to
editing, between 1955 and 1958. Carolina has three children: Vera -LRB-two-RRB-, José Carlos
-LRB-five-RRB-, and João -LRB-eight-RRB-. They live in a favela, or shantytown, where living spaces
consist of crude huts built of cardboard and wood scraps. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vera</b></font>) daily life consists of
collecting paper and metal scraps for food money. While looking for scraps outside a
football stadium, Carolina endures taunts from white patrons. Carolina often fares
no better closer to home--meddlesome favela woman like Dona Rosa and Dona Silvia pick
fights with Carolina's children and try to provoke Carolina. Favelalife is full of hunger, disease, violence, and alcoholism. Carolina's
only consolation is writing and the occasional kindness of friends and strangers,
such as when a man stops by the favela and gives Carolina's daughter, Vera, one
hundred cruzieros, the equivalent of what Carolina often earns in a day. Carolina struggles to insulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Vera</b></font>) children from bad influences, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Vera</b></font>)
receives several summons from the police station regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Vera</b></font>) boys' behavior. After
a few visits there, and after a neighbor woman, Chica, levels an accusation of rape
against João, Carolina briefly considers interning her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) children in a public shelter
for their own safety and wellbeing. Carolina believes that João's accuser is lying,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) worries that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) children are in danger while the matter is being
investigated. After two runaways from the shelter seek refuge in Carolina's home,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) hears their stories of horrible abuse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) changes her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) mind about putting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) children there, recognizing that the experience would likely turn them into
criminals. The fact that the favelachanges everyone it touches is
a reality that Carolina fully understands. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) observes a new resident become
increasingly argumentative and desperate as they adapt to the <div class="bookquote">``dog-eat-dog''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>mentality that rules the favela, Carolina recognizes that a person can resist being
dragged down by it only for so long. Carolina takes every opportunity she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) can get to participate in Brazil's
political system, but after going to Congress to observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) leaders, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) feels
nothing but disgust. In response to the ignorance she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) sees from those in power,
Carolina levels many critiques against the political system that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) believes
contributes to the poverty and hunger of the favelados. To
Carolina, Brazil's President Juscelino is a bird in a cage, and the favela dwellers
are hungry cats that may someday rise up against him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) if given the chance. On a more
day-to-day level, Carolina senses that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) lives in a system that conspires against
the poor. Inflation is rampant, and prices for basic necessities, such as rice and
flour, can be absurd. When Carolina watches a factory owner dump rotted food near
the favela, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) considers it an act of blatant cruelty. Carolina also endures racial
and class discrimination every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) ventures out of the favelaand into the city of São Paulo. While taking a streetcar, Carolina
discusses the politician Dr. Adhemar with other passengers, who blame him (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) for the
steep increases in the cost of transportation. Carolina thinks that Adehemar is
angry and wants to punish the poor. In the often-brutal world she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) lives in, Carolina
wonders how much worse conditions can get. Carolina refuses to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) interest in marrying before her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>)
children, even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) is proposed to by a man named Manuel, who, compared to the
other favelados, is fairly well off, a worker and abstainer from
alcohol. Against her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) own better judgment, Carolina also becomes intertwined with a
gypsy named Raimundo, who awakens in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) a sense of romance and adventure.
Ultimately, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) is not the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) was, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) moves
away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) is sick and broken-hearted. Through both entanglements, Carolina maintains
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) is not the marrying type, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) children come first, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) is unwilling to
make the sacrifices that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) sees other women making in order to get
married. The intervention of a journalist named Audalio Dantas helps Carolina to
realize her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) dream of being published. When excerpts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) diary appear in a weekly
magazine called O Cruziero,Carolina tells
everyone she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) can about her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) new fame. Unfortunately, being published does not have
the effect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) was hoping for. Not only do Carolina's dire daily circumstances
remain unchanged, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) quickly finds success to be a bitter pill when the favela
fills with disparaging talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) motives. Even after her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) publication, Carolina
must deal with the same challenges and frustrations: the struggle to scrape together
enough money for food, the lines at the water spigot, the fights, and the racism and
sexism she (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) faces on a daily basis. Despite these daily humiliations, Carolina holds
fast to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) dream of finding a home far from the favela for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carolina</b></font>) family.
