A gigantic staircase stands to the left; a cistern surrounded by a wall of green bronze appears at the back. The Young Syrian exclaims how Salomé is beautiful tonight. It is as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was dancing. <div class="bookquote">``Look at the moon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herodias</b></font>)</div>cries Herodias' Page, comparing it to a woman rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tomb, a woman <div class="bookquote">``looking for dead things.''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) warns the Syrian that he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) looks at the princess too much. A noise is heard in the hall, and the Soldiers complain that the Jews are howling again about their religion. The First Soldier observes that the Tetrarch -LRB-King Herod-RRB- has a <div class="bookquote">``somber look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herod</b></font>)</div>and the soldiers wonder at whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) is looking. Suddenly the voice of Jokanaan is heard from the cistern, proclaiming the coming of the Messiah: <div class="bookquote">``The eyes of the blind shall see the day, and the ears of the deaf shall be opened.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Messiah</b></font>)</div>The First Soldier explains to the Cappadocian that Jokanaan is a prophet from the desert. It is impossible to understand what the prophet says, and the Tetrarch has forbidden the prophet being seen. The Cappadocian remarks that the cistern must make an unhealthy prison. The Second Soldier protests: Herod's elder brother, Herodias' first husband, lived there for twelve years without dying. Ultimately he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had to be strangled by Naaman, the Negro executioner, bearing Herod's death-ring. The Syrian exclaims that Salomé approaches. She (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) enters, insisting that she (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cannot stay with Herod looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) all the while <div class="bookquote">``with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) mole's eyes under his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) shaking eyelids.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herod</b></font>)</div>To the Page's horror, the Syrian invites her (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to sit. Salomé welcomes the moon, cold and chaste, with a virgin's beauty. Jokanaan again announces the coming of the Lord. Salomé asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is the prophet Herod fears, the prophet who maligns her (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother. As Jokanaan preaches on, Salomé insists that she (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>). All attempt to dissuade her (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) plies the Syrian to bring the prophet forth. The prophet emerges, and Salomé looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>). Salomé exclaims that the prophet's eyes are terrible above all, like <div class="bookquote">``black lakes troubled by fantastic moons.''  (<font color='red'><b>the prophet</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) is a wasted <div class="bookquote">``ivory statue,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>chaste like the moon. <div class="bookquote">``Who is this woman who is looking at me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Salomé</b></font>)</div>protests Jokenaan, bidding Salomé begone. Salomé implores the prophet to speak on: his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) voice is like wine. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``amorous of his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) body.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Jokanaan curses her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anew. Begging Salomé to stop, the Syrian kills himself and falls between the prophet and princess. Salomé continues to ask Jokanaan to let her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) orders her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to seek the Lord, refuses to look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), and descends into the cistern. The First Soldier insists that they transport the body lest Herod see it. Suddenly the court enters, and Herod calls for Salomé while Herodias reproaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) for always staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>). Herod muses on the <div class="bookquote">``strange look''  (<font color='red'><b>Herod muses</b></font>)</div>of the moon, comparing her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to a drunken madwoman looking for lovers. Herodias replies that the <div class="bookquote">``moon is like the moon, that is all''  (<font color='red'><b>Herodias</b></font>)</div>and bids him (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) inside. Herod refuses, calling the servants to bring the festivities outside. Herod slips on the blood of the Syrian and gasps at the ill omen. The Soldiers feign that they do not know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) killed himself. Jokanaan announces that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) has foretold has come to pass. Herodias asks Herod to silence the prophet, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) is forever <div class="bookquote">``vomiting insults''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>against her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>). Herod most certainly fears him (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>), and that is the main reason that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) does not deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) to the Jews. Herod replies that the prophet is a holy man who has seen God. A Jew rejoins that God has hidden himself, and thus evil has come upon the land. Jokanaan announces the coming of the <div class="bookquote">``Savior of the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jokanaan</b></font>)</div>A Nazarene declares that Jokanaan speaks of the Messiahs who works miracles. Herodias scoffs. Jokanaan curses the daughter of Babylon with <div class="bookquote">``golden eyes''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``gilded eyelids,''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div>annoucing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) death by stoning, by the piercing of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) body with swords, its mashing under shields. Herodias is enraged that Herod would let Jokanaan slander her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) wife. Herod changes the subject, proposing that all toast Caesar. Increasingly distractedly by Salomé, Herod asks his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) daughter to dance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) refuses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) beseeches her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), swearing to give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wishes. Salomé dances. Herod invites Salomé to ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) reward, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) asks for the head of Jokanaan in a silver charger. Herodias applauds her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). Aghast, Herod begs her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to be reasonable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) offers her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) an emerald from Caesar that, if looked through, has telescopic properties. Salomé continues to demand Jokanaan's head. Herod rejoins that Salomé only asks to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) for looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) will look no more, at neither things nor people. <div class="bookquote">``Only in mirrors should one look, for mirrors do but show us masks.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) offers the implacable Salomé his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) flock of white peacocks with feet of gilded gold. Salomé is unmoved. Herod protests that Jokanaan might be a holy man and has foretold disaster on the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) offers all his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) hidden jewels; he (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) would even give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the veil of the sanctuary to be released from his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) word. Salomé refuses. Herod falls back and the Soldier bears his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) death ring to the frightened Executioner. Moments later, a huge black arm emerges from the cistern, bearing Jokanaan's head on a silver shield. Salomé seizes it and tells the head that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will kiss its mouth now. But she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wonders why Jokanaan refuses to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) God but never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hungers for his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) body, and nothing will quench her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was a virgin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) virginity. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) had looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) would have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and love's mystery is greater than death's. Herod declares Salomé monstrous. Herod refuses to stay and calls for the servants to put out the torches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) will not look at things nor suffer them to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Put out the torches! Hide the moon! Hide the stars!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herod</b></font>) exclaims. Herod begins to climb the staircase to the palace, and the stage goes dark. The voice of Salomé announces that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has kissed the prophet's mouth. It tastes bitter, perhaps of blood or love. A moonbeam falls on Salomé, covering her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) with light. Herod turns and, upon seeing Salomé, orders the soldiers to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). They rush forward and crush her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) beneath their shields.
