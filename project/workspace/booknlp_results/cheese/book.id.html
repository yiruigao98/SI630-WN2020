He (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) carries a package for his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) father. In the first of a series of undated taped transcripts between Adam and a doctor named Brint, Brint asks Adam to remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) earliest memories. In a third- person narration, Adam describes taking a long, exhausting bus trip with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother and father in the middle of the night. The Farmers end up in a different house, where everything felt different. During his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bike journey, Adam gets directions to Rutterburg from an old man at a gas station. Adam tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) will stay at a motel in Belton Falls that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) once stayed in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) family, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) lies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is visiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father in a hospital. Brint brings up the name Paul Delmonte, whom Adam does not know. As Adam pedals along the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sings the children's song <div class="bookquote">``The Farmer in the Dell,''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>which was the Farmer family theme song. Adam's fears are realized and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is confronted by a ferocious German shepherd at the bottom of a hill, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) manages to ride past it. Brint asks Adam about the mysterious <div class="bookquote">``clues''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Farmer</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) alluded to earlier in their dialogue. Adam mentions that the dog may be a clue. Adam remembers walking to the library with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was nine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father suddenly led Adam on an alternate route through the woods, where father and a vicious dog fought. Adam remembers that something was strange about his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father's flight into the woods. Adam tells Brint about his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) girlfriend, the mischievous, talkative, but ultimately sensitive Amy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) remembers a day Amy called to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) that, while at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father's newspaper office, an editor had dropped in for a visit from Rawlings, Pennsylvania, where Adam had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) family had moved from. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said that the editor did not know of a Farmer family. Adam lied to Amy that they only lived in Rawlings for a few months, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) became more curious about his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) family's past. Brint asks Adam if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thinks his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father lied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) about coming from Rawlings, but Adam says no. Adam remembers the one time he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) investigated further. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father kept official documents in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bottom desk drawer at home, and Adam unlocked it one day while his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father was outside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) birth certificate from Rawlings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) also found another certificate in a sealed envelope--for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) again, but with the wrong birthday. Adam tells Brint he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought the second certificate was a mistake. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) remembers spying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) parents and wondering what secret they seemed to be hiding that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother sad and closet herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) room all day. The only day she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was happy was on Thursdays, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``special''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>telephone hour at night that Adam was not to interrupt. Adam often wondered whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be calling, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no friends, and they had no living relatives, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father had told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) before. One Thursday night, Adam eavesdropped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother over another phone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) overheard an older woman named Martha asking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) nephew, Adam, and realized that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) parents had lied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Resting from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bike ride and eating at a Carver diner, Adam is harassed by a teenager, Whipper, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) two cronies. Adam leaves the diner, package in hand. Before leaving Carver, Adam places a call to Amy. A man answers and says there is no Amy at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) residence. Adam sees Whipper and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) friends coming, and makes a quick getaway on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bike. Adam brings up someone called the <div class="bookquote">``gray man''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>to Brint. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is not sure who he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is, but knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is an important clue. Brint brings up Paul Delmonte. Adam asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is the gray man, and says that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was brought up earlier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was bluffing when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) told Brint he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) did not want to talk about Paul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) actually does not know who Paul is. Adam pedals outside Carver. A car, driven by Whipper and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) friends from the diner, knocks him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) into a deep ditch next to the road. A kindly old man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paranoid wife help Adam out of the ditch and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) a lift to a town near Belton Falls. Adam tells Brint he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) remembers who the gray man is now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was someone his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father called Grey, who was always there in their lives, but seemed like he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was invisible, which is why Adam called him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) the <div class="bookquote">``gray man.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Grey came to their house once or twice a month, on Saturdays, to talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father in the cellar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) remembers one Saturday when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) tried to spy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father and Grey, but the cellar was soundproof. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father, unbeknownst to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and later Adam spied on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) parents as they discuss Adam's growing suspicions. With Brint, Adam says that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father told him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) real name was Paul Delmonte that that Adam Farmer was a fabrication. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father revealed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own real name was Anthony Delmonte, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had been a reporter in the small town of Blount, New York, for the Blount Telegrapher. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blount</b></font>) was soon promoted, and later uncovered certain important documents at the State House in Albany which linked officials in the corrupt state and federal government to organized crime. Anthony testified in Washington, D.C. before a closed Senate committee, and in return he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) was promised protection and his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) identity kept secret. For a year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) hid in hotel rooms and only occasionally visited his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) guarded home. Adam says his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) everything about the situation so that Adam would be protected against betrayal if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) were questioned. Adam tells Brint that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father finally returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) job in Blount, thinking that the whole ordeal was over. After near-fatal brushes with a car bomb and a hired killer, Anthony realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) was not safe. Adam tells Brint that Grey was one of the first men behind a new government program to protect witness who testified against powerful organizations, called the U.S. Department of Re-Identification. Grey's men had foiled the two murder attempts, and when Louise received a threatening phone call one night, Anthony reluctantly agreed to join the department. Grey relocated them with new names but kept them in the Northeast so they would not stand out. Grey arranged for the newspaper to report that the family had been killed in a car crash. Back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) journey, Adam emerges from a drugstore in Hookset to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bike has vanished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) looks for it in a deserted area. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) spots a large man with a Southern accent, Arthur, who is virtually encaged in the second-floor fire escape of a nearby building. Arthur tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) that Junior Varney took the bike. Brint presses for more specific details about Anthony's testimony, which Adam says his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father did not have time to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) about. Adam remembers asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father more about the transition. Anthony explained that it hurt to give up journalism for insurance, but it hurt Louise more, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) was attached to Blount. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blount</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Blount</b></font>) that Grey comes to Monument to update him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) on developments, ask about any forgotten details about the case, and bring bonus money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) says that, although the evidence he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) gave has been used, no one knew if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had divulged all possible information, which is why he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) believed Grey checked in for more details, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) always tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) there is nothing more. Brint asks several times about Anthony's information, but Adam says he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) never questioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father, and is taken aback by Brint's aggressive requests. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thinks that Brint may be one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father's enemies, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) acknowledges his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) dependence on Brint for recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) memory. In the first person account of Adam's journey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fights Junior Varney outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) house, reclaims his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bike, and rides away. Adam tells Brint a memory of the time the Farmers had to leave town for a few days, as one of Grey's men had overheard a conversation on a wiretap in which Monument and the next day's date were mentioned. On the bike trip, Adam finally reaches the <div class="bookquote">``Rest-A-While''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Farmer</b></font>)</div>motel in Belton Falls, the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stayed in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) parents last year. It appears closed and deserted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) calls Amy on a pay phone. Adam is connected to the same man as before, who says he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) has had the number for three years. A gas station attendant tells Adam the motel has been closed for a few years. Adam describes the family's road trip to Brint. They stayed at the <div class="bookquote">``Rest-A- While''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>motel, and the next morning headed out to another town. Thinking a car was following them, they pulled over to the side of the road as if to admire the view. As the other car passed, Adam's father assured them that they were Grey's men. They drove on until they reached a breathtaking view, and the Farmers stepped out of the car. Suddenly, a car came out around a curve and crashed into them. Adam was sent flying and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) mother died. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) heard three voices that said his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father got away, but that <div class="bookquote">``they''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>would get him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>). Adam saw a tall man in gray pants walk toward them. The man told the other men to keep Adam, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) may be <div class="bookquote">``useful.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Adam was taken by them and fell into a hazy dream. Brint asks Adam who the man was, but Adam does not respond verbally or physically. Adam reaches Rutterburg, the final destination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) journey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) turns a corner and sees <div class="bookquote">``the hospital''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and meets Dr. Dupont. Adam looks out the gates and vows to ride his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) bike out there someday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) and the doctor walk past many of the employees and patients. They enter Adam's room, and Adam asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) if his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father is dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fears going to <div class="bookquote">``that other room''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>where he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) answers questions. The doctor does not answer, but Adam recognizes the sad look on the doctor's face that tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) father is dead every time Adam brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) up. Adam sings <div class="bookquote">``The Farmer in the Dell''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Farmer</b></font>)</div>as the doctor opens up the package and takes out Pokey the Pig, Adam's old stuffed animal. Adam finishes the song, which ends with <div class="bookquote">``The cheese stands alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Farmer</b></font>)</div>The doctor calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) Paul, and Adam wonders who that is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knows there is another name, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) cannot think about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) knows who he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thinks, <div class="bookquote">``I am the cheese.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Brint files his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) annual report on <div class="bookquote">``File Data 865--01,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brint</b></font>)</div>the information Adam's father may have known about, with references to <div class="bookquote">``Subject A''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam father</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Adam-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``Personnel #2222''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Grey-RRB-, and <div class="bookquote">``Agency Basic Procedures.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grey</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) says it was impossible to elicit the <div class="bookquote">``suspected knowledge''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>of Adam sought by <div class="bookquote">``Department 1- R.''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam/Adam Farmer</b></font>)</div>This is the third annual questioning of Adam, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) continues not to reveal any information given by <div class="bookquote">``Witness #599--6''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Adam's father-RRB-. Brint issues three possible advisories for Adam's case. One, that Department 1-R revises a policy that disallows <div class="bookquote">``termination''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-death-RRB-. Two, that the Department reinstate the suspended Grey, since it is unclear whether Grey allowed the termination of Adam's parents by <div class="bookquote">``Adversaries,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam parents</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``only circumstantial evidence''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam parents</b></font>)</div>shows that Grey notified them of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) Adam's father's location. The final advisory states that since Adam is the final linkage between Adam's father and File Data 865--01, Brint recommends that Adam be confined until termination is approved, or until he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``obliterates.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The final page of the novel reprints the first paragraph of the book, where Adam begins his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) journey to Rutterburg.
