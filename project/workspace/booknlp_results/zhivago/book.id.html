Yury's mother dies when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is still a young boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is raised by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle Kolya. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enrolls at the university in Moscow, studying medicine. There he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meets Tonya, and the two marry and have a son, Sasha. Yury becomes a medical officer in the army and is stationed in a small town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) meets Lara, a woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) has seen twice before. The first time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) visited the house of a woman who tried to commit suicide, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sasha</b></font>) saw Lara, the woman's daughter, exchanging glances with an older man, Komarovsky. The second time, Lara tried to shoot Komarovsky at a party and instead wounded a prosecutor from the courts. Lara is married to Pasha, a young soldier who is missing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has come west to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Lara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has a daughter, Katya, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has left in Yuryatin, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) birthplace in the Urals. Yury is captivated by Lara, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lara</b></font>) returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lara</b></font>) wife and son in Moscow. Times are difficult, and the family must struggle to find food and firewood. They decide to move east to Varyniko, an estate once owned by Tonya's grandfather but now being worked as a collective. The journey is long and difficult, but when they arrive they find plenty of food and wood. Yury goes to the nearest city, Yuryatin, to use the library. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) sees Lara once more. They begin an affair that lasts two months before Yury decides to break off contact and confess all to his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) wife. On his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) is captured by the partisan army, which conscripts him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) as a medical officer. Yury is forced to remain with the army through the end of the war between the Tsarist Whites and the Communist Reds. When he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) is released, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) returns to Yuryatin to find Lara. The two spend several months together, and then they go to Varykino to hide. Lara's former husband, Pasha, became a leader in the Urals but is now wanted. Komarovsky returns and urges them to go east with him (<font color='blue'><b>Komarovsky</b></font>) to avoid being killed. Yury's family has been exiled to Paris, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Komarovsky</b></font>) is promised the opportunity to join them. Yury tricks Lara into taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Komarovsky</b></font>) daughter and going with Komarovsky, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Komarovsky</b></font>) remains at Varykino. Yury returns to Moscow and finds work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Komarovsky</b></font>) begins living with Marina, the daughter of a family friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Komarovsky</b></font>) and Marina have two children. Yury's old friends Misha and Nicky encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) to resolve his (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) divided loyalties toward Tonya and Marina. He (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) finds a new job but on the way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) first day at work he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) dies of a heart attack. Lara comes to the funeral and asks Yury's half-brother, a lawyer, if there is any way to track the location of a child given away to strangers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tonya</b></font>) stays for several days and then disappears, likely dying in a concentration camp. Years later, Misha and Nicky are fighting in World War II and encounter a laundry-girl, Tanya, who tells them her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) life story. They determine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) is the daughter of Lara and Yury.
