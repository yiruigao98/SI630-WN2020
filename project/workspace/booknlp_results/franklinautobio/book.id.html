He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) was apprenticed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) brother he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) spent 18 months working for a printer with his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) friend James Ralph, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One. Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France -LRB-the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) succeeded in many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) proposals, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished. The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) died before he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) got the chance.
