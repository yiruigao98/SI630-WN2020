On her (<font color='blue'><b>Vicario</b></font>) wedding night, after discovering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vicario</b></font>) was not a virgin, Angela's husband, Bayardo San Roman, returns her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) house. Angela's twin brothers, Pedro Vicario and Pablo Vicario, ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) who took her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) virginity, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) tells them that Santiago Nasar did. The brothers find Santiago and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Nasar</b></font>). The narrative is non-linear. The narrator begins the story by telling us about Santiago Nasar's household the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Nasar</b></font>) was murdered. In the course of the chapter, we learn that Santiago lived with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nasar</b></font>) mother, Placida Linero; their cook, Victoria Guzman; and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter, Divina Flor. Santiago's father, Ibrahim Nasar, has died three years previously. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Ibrahim</b></font>) father died, Santiago took over the family ranch, which has been very successful; the Nasars are wealthy in their community. The day that Santiago is murdered was a significant day in town because the Bishop was coming by boat to bless the marriage of Angela Vicario and Bayardo San Roman. Many people were heading over to the dock to see the boats. Pedro and Pablo Vicario were sitting in the local milk-shop, which was en route to the dock, so that they could see Santiago Nasar either going or returning in order to track him (<font color='blue'><b>Nasar</b></font>) down and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Nasar</b></font>). The narrator's sister learns that Angela Vicario was returned home on the night of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vicario</b></font>) wedding. Bayardo San Roman had come to town to find a bride. After deciding on Angela, the courtship was short. Because Bayardo came from a prestigious, wealthy family, and the Vicarios were relatively poor, Angela did not really have a choice, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) did not love Bayardo at the time they were wed.. The night before the murder, there had been lots of wedding revelry that had continued into the early morning at a local whorehouse run by Maria Alejandrina Cervantes, where Santiago Nasar had been carousing with the twins and the narrator until early in the morning. After returning home and finding their sister in disgrace, the Vicario brothers set out to avenge her (<font color='blue'><b>Vicario</b></font>) honor by murdering Santiago Nasar. Even though they repeatedly announced their intent to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>Nasar</b></font>), the butcher, the police officer, and the Colonel all thought that the Vicarios are largely bluffing. Clothilde Armenta, the proprietor of the milk shop, even told the local priest about what the Vicario twins were threatening to do. However, in the excitement surrounding the arrival of the bishop, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) forgot about her (<font color='blue'><b>Vicario</b></font>) warning. After the murder, the entire Vicario family left town because of the disgrace the combination of events had brought upon their family. A week after the murder, Bayardo San Roman left with his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) family; they came and retrieved him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) by boat. The Vicario brothers were imprisoned for three years. After their release from prison, Pablo proceeded to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>Pablo</b></font>) betrothed, Prudencia Cotes, and Pedro went back into the armed forces. After Bayardo returned Angela to her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) home on their wedding night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) fell in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>). After she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) moved away from the town where she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) was disgraced, she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) letters every week for seventeen years, and eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>). For years after the crime, it was all anyone in the town spoke of. The narrator tells how his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) friend Cristo Bedoya searched frantically for Santiago the morning of the murder in order to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) of the Vicario brothers' plan, but failed to find Santiago because he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) did not realize that Santiago had gone to the house of his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) fiance, Flora Miguel. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vicario</b></font>) father was the first to warn Santiago of the murder. At this point, there were crowds of people outside who had come to see the Bishop but had lingered because they had heard the rumor that Santiago was to be killed. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) left Flora Miguel's house, Santiago was very confused. Clothilde Armenta yelled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Armenta</b></font>) to run, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Armenta</b></font>) ran the fifty yards to his (<font color='blue'><b>Armenta</b></font>) front door. The Vicario brothers easily caught up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Armenta</b></font>), and stabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Armenta</b></font>) to death right outside of Santiago's front door.
