He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilhelm</b></font>) is out of place from the beginning, living in a hotel filled with elderly retirees and continuing throughout the novel to be a figure of isolation amidst crowds. The novella traverses one very important day in the life of this self-same Tommy Wilhelm: his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilhelm</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``day of reckoning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tommy/Tommy Wilhelm/Wilhelm</b></font>)</div>so to speak. As the novella opens, Tommy is descending in the hotel elevator, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) way to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) father for breakfast, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) does every morning. However, this morning feels different to Tommy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) feels a certain degree of fear and of foreboding for something that lies in the hours ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) and has been building for quite some time. The reader begins to discover through Tommy's thoughts and through a series of flashbacks that Tommy has just recently been fired from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) job as a salesman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) is a college drop-out, a man with two children, recently separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) is a man on the brink of financial disaster. Tommy has just given over the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) savings to the fraudulent Dr. Tamkin, who has promised to knowingly invest it in the commodities market. Amid all of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) has, apparently, fallen in love with a woman named Olive, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) cannot marry because his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) wife will not grant him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) a divorce. Tommy is unhappy and in need of assistance both emotionally and financially. In the first three chapters the reader follows Tommy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) talks with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) father, Dr. Adler, who sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) son as a failure in every sense of the word. Tommy is refused financial assistance and also refused any kind of support, emotionally or otherwise, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) father. It is also within these beginning chapters that the flashbacks begin. The flashbacks highlight, among other things, Tommy's meeting with the duplicitous Maurice Venice, the talent scout who shows initial interest in a young Tommy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) good looks. Wilhelm, however, is later rejected by the same scout after a failed screen test but nevertheless attempts a career in Hollywood as an actor. He (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) discontinues his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) college education and moves to California, against his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) parent's will and warnings. The chapters that follow focus on Tommy's encounters and conversations with Dr. Tamkin, a seemingly fraudulent and questionable <div class="bookquote">``psychologist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tamkin/Dr. Tamkin</b></font>)</div>who gives Tommy endless advice and thus provides the assistance he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) had looked for from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) father. Whether Tamkin is fraudulent and questionable as a psychologist, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) is a liar and a charlatan is a question that is constantly being posed to us. Regardless, Tamkin is quite charming and appeals to Tommy. Dr. Tamkin claims to be a poet, a healer, a member of the Detroit Purple Gang, as well as claiming a number of other positions and titles. Despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) lies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) gives Tommy kernels of truth that become significant in the novella and for Tommy. Moreover, Tommy entrusts Tamkin with the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) savings to invest in the commodities market, since Tamkin claims a certain stock market expertise. The rest of the novella consists of Tommy and Dr. Tamkin traveling back and forth to and from the stock market, meeting several characters along the way. The novel finally illustrates Tommy's terrible loss in the commodities in which Tamkin has invested Tommy's money. Tommy has lost all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) savings but still has the monetary demands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) family to meet. Furthermore, Tamkin has disappeared. After an attempt to look for Tamkin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) room at the hotel, the novella comes to a close with three climaxes--two minor and one large, final climax. First, there is the final confrontation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) father in the massage room of the hotel in which Tommy is denied any assistance one last time, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) stands before his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) naked father. Afterward, Tommy has a loud and almost raving fight with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) wife on the telephone in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) claims to be <div class="bookquote">``suffocating''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and unable to <div class="bookquote">``breathe.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Full of rage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) exits out onto Broadway where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) believes to see Dr. Tamkin at a funeral, nearby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) calls out to Tamkin but receives no reply. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) is swept in by a rush of people and finds himself carried into a crowd within the chapel where the funeral is taking place. It is here that the final climax comes because Tommy finds himself before the body of a dead stranger, unable to break away and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) begins to cry and weep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) releases pools of emotion and <div class="bookquote">``crie-LSB-s-RSB- with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>It is here that the book ends. Other people at the funeral are confused as to who he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) is, wondering how close he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) had been to the deceased. The deceased is a stranger but Tommy, however, is left in this <div class="bookquote">``happy oblivion of tears.''
