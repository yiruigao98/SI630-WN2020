They receive a letter from Don Armado, a Spaniard visiting the King's court, telling them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) has caught Costard, a fool, and Jaquenetta, a country wench, consorting in the park. The King announces Costard's sentence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and the lords go off to begin their oath. Don Armado confesses to Moth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Armado</b></font>) page, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Armado</b></font>) has fallen in love with Jaquenetta. He (<font color='blue'><b>Armado</b></font>) writes her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) a letter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Armado</b></font>) asks Costard to deliver. Meanwhile, the Princess of France has arrived to visit the King. Because of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) oath, however, the King cannot receive the Princess and her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) party at his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) court; he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lords must visit them at their camp outside the castle. The three lords fall in love with the three ladies, as does the King with the Princess. Berowne gives Costard a letter to deliver to Rosaline, but Costard accidentally switches it with the letter from Don Armado to Jaquenetta. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Armado</b></font>) gives Berowne's letter to Jaquenetta, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) brings it to the learned Holofernes and Sir Nathaniel to read for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>). They tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) that the letter was meant for someone else and to deliver it to the King. Berowne watches the King from a hiding spot as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) reads about his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) love for the Princess. Longaville enters, and the King hides as well; he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and Berowne observe Longaville reading of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) love for Maria. Dumaine enters, Longaville hides, and all three see Dumaine reading an ode he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) has written to Katherine. Longaville advances and tells Dumaine that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is not alone in love. The King then advances and scolds the two men for breaking their oath. Berowne advances and reveals that the King is in love as well. Jaquenetta arrives and gives Berowne the letter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) rips up. However, Dumaine picks up a piece of the letter with Berowne's name on it, and Berowne confesses that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is in love as well. The four men decide to court their women. The King and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lords arrive at the Princess's pavilion dressed as Muscovites. The women heed Boyet's prior warnings and decide to switch favors, so that the men will mistake them for each other. After the men leave and reappear as themselves, the women reveal their prank. They all watch a show of the Nine Worthies, performed by Don Armado, Sir Nathaniel, and Holofernes. A messenger arrives to tell the Princess that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father has died, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) prepares to return to France. The women tell their suitors to seek them again in a year, and the play ends with their departure.
