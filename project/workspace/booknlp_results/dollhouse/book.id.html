on Christmas Eve. Nora Helmer enters her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) well-furnished living room--the
setting of the entire play--carrying several packages. Torvald Helmer,
Nora's husband, comes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Helmer</b></font>) study when he (<font color='blue'><b>Helmer</b></font>) hears her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) arrive.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Helmer</b></font>) greets her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) playfully and affectionately, but then chides her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>)
for spending so much money on Christmas gifts. Their conversation
reveals that the Helmers have had to be careful with money for many
years, but that Torvald has recently obtained a new position at
the bank where he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) works that will afford them a more comfortable
lifestyle. Helene, the maid, announces that the Helmers' dear friend
Dr. Rank has come to visit. At the same time, another visitor has arrived,
this one unknown. To Nora's great surprise, Kristine Linde, a former
school friend, comes into the room. The two have not seen each other
for years, but Nora mentions having read that Mrs. Linde's husband
passed away a few years earlier. Mrs. Linde tells Nora that when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) husband died, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) was left with no money and no children. Nora
tells Mrs. Linde about her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) first year of marriage to Torvald. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>)
explains that they were very poor and both had to work long hours.
Torvald became sick, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) adds, and the couple had to travel to Italy
so that Torvald could recover. Nora inquires further about Mrs. Linde's life, and Mrs.
Linde explains that for years she (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) had to care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) sick mother
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) two younger brothers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) states that her (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) mother has passed
away, though, and that the brothers are too old to need her (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>). Instead
of feeling relief, Mrs. Linde says she (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) feels empty because she (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) has
no occupation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) hopes that Torvald may be able to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) obtain employment.
Nora promises to speak to Torvald and then reveals a great secret
to Mrs. Linde--without Torvald's knowledge, Nora illegally borrowed
money for the trip that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) and Torvald took to Italy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) told
Torvald that the money had come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) father. For years, Nora
reveals, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) has worked and saved in secret, slowly repaying the
debt, and soon it will be fully repaid. Krogstad, a low-level employee at the bank where Torvald works,
arrives and proceeds into Torvald's study. Nora reacts uneasily
to Krogstad's presence, and Dr. Rank, coming out of the study, says
Krogstad is <div class="bookquote">``morally sick.''  (<font color='red'><b>Krogstad</b></font>)</div>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) has finished meeting with Krogstad,
Torvald comes into the living room and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) can probably
hire Mrs. Linde at the bank. Dr. Rank, Torvald, and Mrs. Linde then
depart, leaving Nora by herself. Nora's children return with their
nanny, Anne-Marie, and Nora plays with them until she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) notices Krogstad's
presence in the room. The two converse, and Krogstad is revealed
to be the source of Nora's secret loan. Krogstad states that Torvald wants to fire him (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>)
position at the bank and alludes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) own poor reputation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>)
asks Nora to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) influence to ensure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) position remains
secure. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) refuses, Krogstad points out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>)
possession a contract that contains Nora's forgery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) father's
signature. Krogstad blackmails Nora, threatening to reveal her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) crime
and to bring shame and disgrace on both Nora and her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) husband if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) does not prevent Torvald from firing him (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>). Krogstad leaves, and
when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) not to fire Krogstad,
but Torvald will hear nothing of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) declares Krogstad an immoral
man and states that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) feels physically ill in the presence of such
people. Act Two opens on the following day, Christmas. Alone,
Nora paces her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) living room, filled with anxiety. Mrs. Linde arrives
and helps sew Nora's costume for the ball that Nora will be attending
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) neighbors' home the following evening. Nora tells Mrs. Linde that
Dr. Rank has a mortal illness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) father. Nora's
suspicious behavior leads Mrs. Linde to guess that Dr. Rank is the
source of Nora's loan. Nora denies Mrs. Linde's charge but refuses
to reveal the source of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) distress. Torvald arrives, and Nora
again begs him (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) to keep Krogstad employed at the bank, but again
Torvald refuses. When Nora presses him (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) admits that Krogstad's
moral behavior isn't all that bothers him (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) dislikes Krogstad's
overly familiar attitude. Torvald and Nora argue until Torvald sends
the maid to deliver Krogstad's letter of dismissal. Torvald leaves. Dr. Rank arrives and tells Nora that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) is close to death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) attempts to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) up and
begins to flirt with him (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) seems to be preparing to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) to
intervene on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) behalf in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) struggle with Torvald. Suddenly,
Dr. Rank reveals to Nora that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>). In light of
this revelation, Nora refuses to ask Dr. Rank for anything. Once Dr. Rank leaves, Krogstad arrives and demands an
explanation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) dismissal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) wants respectability and has changed the
terms of the blackmail: he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) now insists to Nora that not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>)
be rehired at the bank but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) be rehired in a higher position. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>)
then puts a letter detailing Nora's debt and forgery in the -Helmers'
letterbox. In a panic, Nora tells Mrs. Linde everything, and Mrs.
Linde instructs Nora to delay Torvald from opening the letter as
long as possible while she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) goes to speak with Krogstad. In order
to distract Torvald from the letterbox, Nora begins to practice the
tarantella she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) will perform at that evening's costume party. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>)
agitated emotional state, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) dances wildly and violently, displeasing
Torvald. Nora manages to make Torvald promise not to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) mail
until after she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) performs at the party. Mrs. Linde soon returns and
says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) has left Krogstad a note but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) will be gone
until the following evening. The next night, as the costume party takes place upstairs, Krogstad
meets Mrs. Linde in the Helmers' living room. Their conversation
reveals that the two had once deeply in love, but Mrs. Linde left
Krogstad for a wealthier man who would enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>)
family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) tells Krogstad that now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) is free of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) own
familial obligations and wishes to be with Krogstad and care for
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children. Krogstad is overjoyed and says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will demand his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter
back before Torvald can read it and learn Nora's secret. Mrs. Linde,
however, insists he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) leave the letter, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Linde</b></font>) believes both Torvald
and Nora will be better off once the truth has been revealed. Soon after Krogstad's departure, Nora and Torvald enter,
back from the costume ball. After saying goodnight to Mrs. Linde,
Torvald tells Nora how desirable she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) looked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) danced. Dr. Rank, who
was also at the party and has come to say goodnight, promptly interrupts
Torvald's advances on Nora. After Dr. Rank leaves, Torvald finds
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) letterbox two of Dr. Rank's visiting cards, each with a black
cross above the name. Nora knows Dr. Rank's cards constitute his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>)
announcement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) will soon die, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) informs Torvald of this
fact. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) then insists that Torvald read Krogstad's letter. Torvald reads the letter and is outraged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) calls Nora
a hypocrite and a liar and complains that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) has ruined his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) happiness.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) declares that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) will not be allowed to raise their children.
Helene then brings in a letter. Torvald opens it and discovers that
Krogstad has returned Nora's contract -LRB-which contains the forged
signature-RRB-. Overjoyed, Torvald attempts to dismiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) past insults,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Torvald</b></font>) harsh words have triggered something in Nora. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) declares
that despite their eight years of marriage, they do not understand
one another. Torvald, Nora asserts, has treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) like a <div class="bookquote">``doll''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nora</b></font>)</div>to be played with and admired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) decides to leave Torvald, declaring that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>) must <div class="bookquote">``make sense of -LSB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>)-RSB-self and everything around her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>)
walks out, slamming the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Nora</b></font>).
