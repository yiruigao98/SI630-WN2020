In this book, Emil Sinclair recounts the various episodes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) childhood that led to a profound change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) Weltanschauung or worldview. Interspersed in and among these tales are Sinclair's recollections of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) was thinking at the time in question and some analysis of why he (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) acted as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emil</b></font>) did in any given situation. The first episode occurs when Sinclair is ten years old. Sinclair invents a story about stealing some apples and is then blackmailed by an eleven year old thug, Franz Kromer. Not having enough money to pay off Kromer, Sinclair begins to steal and is otherwise subjected to tormenting humiliation by Kromer. A slightly older, but amazingly mature boy, Max Demian, soon enters Sinclair's school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) approaches Sinclair one day after class and presents him (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) with an inventive interpretation of the story of Cain and Abel. This interpretation contradicts the standard Christian story Sinclair has been fed and the new idea excites Sinclair. Seemingly knowing everything, and with unbounded capability, Demian convinces Kromer to stop tormenting Sinclair. Freed from the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) tensions, Sinclair abandons Demian and attempts to become a more model child. After a number of years of only peripheral contact, Sinclair and Demian are reunited in a confirmation class. Though they do not spend much time together at first, their relationship is rekindled after the teacher discusses Cain and Abel in class one day. Demian switches his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) seat to be next to Sinclair and they spend much time discussing the will and exploring Demian's uncanny ability to affect how other people act. During this time, Sinclair's religious faith begins to wane. Demian presents him (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) with the thought that worshipping the God of the Bible is not sufficient. The God of the Bible represents all that is sanctified and good in the world, but, Demian insists, one ought to worship the entire world--the evil parts too. Sinclair is elated that Demian has touched on these thoughts--that the world is divided in two realms--light and darkness, good and bad. Sinclair enters boarding school, confused and unsure of what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thinks and believes. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is approached by an older boy, Alfons Beck, who invites him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) to a bar. They go off together, drink wine, and chat. This marks the beginning of a rebellious streak and a new group of friends for young Sinclair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) often goes out late into the night, drinking and carousing. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) refrains from one of the activities popular among his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) friends: he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) refuses to go with them when they visit women because Sinclair has a yearning for love, not sex. One day in the park, Sinclair sees a girl who is, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>), the paradigm of beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has some male features, but is surrounded by an incredibly alluring air. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) never speaks to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) names her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Beatrice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) becomes a symbol for him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>), an ideal for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) acts. Immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) reforms his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) behavior and ceases his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) activities with his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) friends. Also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) begins to take up painting and paints a picture of this girl. Days later he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) realizes that the picture is also a picture of Demian. In class one day, Sinclair finds a note that speaks about breaking free. Also, it mentions a god, Abraxas. Sinclair is certain that the note is from Demian. Only half paying attention to the day's lecture, Sinclair perks up when he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) hears his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) teacher mention Abraxas. The teacher says that Abraxas is an ancient God who contains both divine and satanic elements. Strolling about town one day, Sinclair hears music emanating from a small, locked church. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is moved by it and sits outside to listen for a while. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does this many times and eventually decides to trail the organist as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) leaves after playing on one occasion. Sinclair follows him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to a bar and sits beside him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). They begin to chat and Sinclair mentions Abraxas. At once, the organist, Pistorius, takes a great interest in Sinclair. This is the start of an intense relationship between the two men. Pistorius becomes a mentor to Sinclair, helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Pistorius</b></font>) to learn further things about himself and teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Pistorius</b></font>) a bit about Abraxas. Knauer, a classmate of Sinclair, approaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Knauer</b></font>) after school one day, seeking guidance. Sinclair feels that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knauer</b></font>) has very little to offer to the boy. Sinclair tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Knauer</b></font>) only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knauer</b></font>) needs to learn to be comfortable with what his (<font color='blue'><b>Knauer</b></font>) innermost soul wants. Later, out for a stroll one restless night, Sinclair comes across Knauer, who is ready to commit suicide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knauer</b></font>) saves Knauer, for which Knauer later displays much gratitude and allegiance. Sinclair begins to see that Pistorius has limitations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pistorius</b></font>) tells Pistorius that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pistorius</b></font>) is too <div class="bookquote">``antiquarian.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pistorius</b></font>) brings Pistorius to recognize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pistorius</b></font>) can only teach Sinclair about old gods and ideas of the past--he (<font color='blue'><b>Pistorius</b></font>) is not creative enough to invent new ones. Their relationship ends as Sinclair ends his (<font color='blue'><b>Pistorius</b></font>) time at preparatory school. Before entering university, Sinclair visits Demian's old house. There, the new owner shows him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) a picture of Demian's mother. Sinclair realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looks exactly like the portraits he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) has been drawing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) unsuccessfully searches for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Strolling around his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) college town one evening, Sinclair runs into Demian and they are happily reunited. Demian tells Sinclair that his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) mother will be very excited to see him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to come by whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) is ready to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). The next day, an excited Sinclair goes to the Demian household. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) and Frau Eva bond at once. They speak of the long journey he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) has undergone to arrive at this point. Sinclair soon becomes a regular in the Demian household. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) is immensely happy to be spending his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) time with Demian, Demian's mother, and others of their type who pass through. There is, however, a note of darkness--both Demian and Sinclair have premonitions of evil to come. Talk about a war begins to brew. Sinclair spends that summer with the Demian family, further strengthening his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) bond with both Demian and Frau Eva. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) summons his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) mental energy to telepathically call Frau Eva. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hears his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) call and sends Demian to him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>). Sinclair is ecstatic that it works. War begins and Demian is called to serve as a lieutenant. Before Sinclair goes off to war, Eva tells him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) now knows how to call her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) needs to, he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) can do so and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will send somebody like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) side. Sinclair is wounded in battle. He (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) summons his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) energy and finds Demian by his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) side one night in the infirmary. Demian tells Sinclair that if he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) ever feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) needs help, he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) no longer needs to call Demian. He (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) simply needs to look inside himself and he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) will see that Demian is within him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>). With that, Demian gives him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) a light kiss on the lips--a kiss that he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) says is from Frau Eva--and vanishes into the night.
