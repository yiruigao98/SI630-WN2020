that give readers a glimpse of what it means to be a woman in an Orthodox Muslim
society in Egypt. The stories are not interconnected, but together they form a vivid
portrayal of Rifaat's world. A woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband are having sex. The wife thinks about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lack of
sexual fulfillment--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband always stops as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) climaxes. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s told
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) desires, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ignores her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and makes her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feel embarrassed for trying to
prolong their sexual intercourse so that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), too, might have an orgasm. The wife hears the call for the daily afternoon prayer. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gets up to
wash herself after having sex, in accordance with Islamic practice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband
stays in bed to nap. After prayer, the wife gazes out the window of their
apartment, thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) once had a view of the entire city of Cairo. The
city has built up over the years, and now the view is limited to that of a
single minaret -LRB-tower of a mosque-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had wished to have a house with a garden
in the suburbs, but because of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's job, they got an apartment in the
city. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) didn't mind so much because of the wonderful view, but now it is gone. The wife prepares the afternoon coffee and brings it into the bedroom for
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, only to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has suffered an attack -LRB-about which the reader
receives no other information except that these attacks have happened before-RRB-
and died. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) son to fetch the doctor, then pours a cup of coffee for
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thinks to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is surprisingly calm. Bahiyya, an elderly woman, tells a story to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) visiting daughter. Bahiyya
recently took herself to the hospital because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was losing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sight. The
doctor indicates that it is too late to help her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--Bahiyya will soon be blind. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
tells her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) blindness is a result of the tears she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has cried for
being born a girl rather than a boy. Bahiyya explains that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
brother's abuse because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was the man of the family. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) learned about sex from
watching animals. When some of the village women found that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had made mud
dolls with genitalia, they castrated her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Bahiyya liked a boy in the village,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) family arranged a marriage for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with another man. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband died
soon after they married. Bahiyya describes the loneliness of being a woman
without a man and says that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feels her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life and youth have been a
waste. In the middle of the night, the narrator hears a phone ringing in another
apartment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband has recently died, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sits alone she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hopes for
some sort of sign from beyond the grave. Since his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) death, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleeps during the
day and stays up at night. Suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own phone rings. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) picks it up, but
there is only silence. The narrator believes that this is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sign. Morning
comes, and during her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) morning prayer she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is grateful and content. The phone
rings again. This time it is the phone operator, who tells the narrator that a
call was accidentally directed to the wrong house last night. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
prayers to ask forgiveness from Allah for having asked for so much. The narrator has recently turned fifty. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thinks of how old she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks,
after having borne three children, and also reflects that in old age one has
fewer close friends to rely on. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has no one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can talk about the
poor relations between herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) angrily sends the servant
out on an errand and immediately feels very alone and starts to cry. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must pull herself together since she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother for their
weekly Thursday lunch. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not close to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother and has always been afraid
to be open with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). They have a very large meal, and as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother is
complaining about young people, the narrator wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother were
close and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could speak about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marriage problems. Suddenly, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother
reveals that today is the anniversary of the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own husband and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still thinks of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) every day. The narrator, unsure what to do or say,
notices her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother crying. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother then bids her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) goodbye, until next
Thursday's lunch. Zeinet awakes to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unmarried daughter Ni'ma is showing signs
of pregnancy. Zeinet's husband, Ghobashi, left their home to work in Libya.
Ni'ma tells Zeinet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) became pregnant right after Ghobashi went away. The night
before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) left, Ghobashi told Zeinet to watch over Ni'ma and said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hoped to
bring back a wedding dress for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could be married. Zeinet
considers the dishonor of Ni'ma's illegitimate pregnancy and how Ghobashi might
react. Ni'ma tells Zeinet it would be best if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) just slipped into the canal so
that the family would not be troubled, but Zeinet rebukes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and says they will
find another solution. Zeinet takes out some money she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s stashed away and gives
it to Ni'ma. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tells Ni'ma to go to Cairo, have the child, and come back in
the middle of the night. Then Zeinet wraps some clothing under her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own clothes
to make it look like she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is pregnant. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will tell Ghobashi, when he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) returns,
that the baby is their son, rather than their illegitimate grandson. Badriyya sees her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, Omar, walking down the street with a group of
men. They are celebrating Omar's release from prison. Badriyya's mother comments
that Omar was a fool for stealing a couple of worthless tires, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) clearly
disapproves of Badriyya's choice of a husband. Omar comes home late, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) is
drunk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) is glad that Badriyya's mother has gone to bed so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) doesn't have
to endure her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) snide remarks. Badriyya remembers their romance. Omar followed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into a movie theater
and sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) out for the next week. Omar talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) plans
to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) own café. Badriyya felt that Omar, like a hero in the movies, would
rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) from a life that seemed like a long, dark tunnel. Badriyya's uncle
told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that Omar was <div class="bookquote">``all talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Omar</b></font>)</div>but allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>). A month later,
Omar was arrested. Badriyya's uncle and mother then tried to convince Badriyya
to divorce Omar, for they believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) was a good-for-nothing who was simply
looking for a woman to support him (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>). Badriyya refused. The morning after Omar's return, Badriyya comes home from work to find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
mother and Omar laughing and playing cards. Badriyya thinks that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has never
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother in such a good mood, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother says that Omar has turned
out to be a nice fellow. Omar tells them about the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) met in prison,
especially a contractor/vendor who has promised to help Omar. Omar is to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) that evening, but Badriyya is disappointed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>)'s leaving because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has
made them a nice dinner. From then on, Omar stays out late and comes home tired from drinking and
drugs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) says that at night he (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>)'s scouting for a location for his (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) café. They
have not had sex, and when Badriyya hints at it, Omar replies that there's
plenty of time for that in the future. When Badriyya's mother asks when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can
expect a grandchild, Omar implies that Badriyya never wants to have sex.
Badriyya is upset and thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is unattractive to Omar or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) is having an
affair. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) goes to the store to buy Omar a pack of cigarettes on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own credit
account. The store's owner tells her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Omar is no good, and everyone knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>)
sleeps around every night. Badriyya finally understands and hopes she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will have
the strength to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) away when he (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) tries to come home that night. The narrator is a little girl. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) older sister, Dalal, tells their mother
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wants to go to a party that evening and that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will take the narrator so
their mother won't worry about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) going out alone after dark. Dalal is often
mean to the narrator, sometimes hitting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and causing their father to believe
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has been bad. When they go out, they don't go to a party. Instead, Dalal meets a boy
named Mahmoud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dalal</b></font>) picks them up in a car, and Dalal and Mahmoud speak in French
so the narrator doesn't understand. Dalal threatens the narrator and makes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
swear to Allah that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) won't tell anyone where they have gone. Mahmoud buys
perfume for Dalal and chocolates for the narrator, then drives them to a kiosk
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dalal</b></font>) buys some hashish. Mahmoud and Dalal get into the backseat together. They repeat the secret meetings many times, and eventually Dalal tells
Mahmoud that though her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father has arranged for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to marry someone else, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
loves Mahmoud and wants to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>). Mahmoud tells her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) does not want to
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). The next time they meet, Dalal tells the narrator to go on without
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and tell Mahmoud that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will meet them in an hour. Mahmoud takes the
narrator to the kiosk, has her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sit on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) lap, and touches her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chest and
shoulders. The narrator kisses his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) face, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) they should go to
meet Dalal. Dalal and Mahmoud fight in the car, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) loses control and crashes them
into a hedge. Dalal has blood on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face and passes out, and Mahmoud drives the
girls home. Their mother and sisters help them in, asking them what happened and
concerned about the fact that they were with a strange boy. The narrator keeps
quiet, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) falls asleep, Dalal smiles at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). The narrator knows that
Dalal won't hit her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) or yell at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again, since she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) protected Dalal's
secret. Sheikh Zeidan leads a crew of men who lay pipe. At the campsite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dalal</b></font>) tells
a newcomer the story of Mansoura. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a beautiful woman with great powers,
whom every man loved. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) married a strong, good man named Sayyid, and they were
initially very happy. Then Sayyid took a job guarding the bean crop of a man
named Hindawi. Hindawi would go to Mansoura at night when Sayyid was away. It is
not certain whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindawi</b></font>) would rape her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) or whether she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) submitted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindawi</b></font>) advances
out of loneliness. The villagers began singing lewd songs about
Mansoura's honor, but Sayyid did not realize that they were about his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindawi</b></font>)
wife. At Mansoura's urging, Sayyid quits guarding Hindawi's farm. Hindawi
obsesses about Mansoura and meets her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at the canal to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to leave
Sayyid for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindawi</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) refuses, and while arguing, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slips into the canal and
drowns. Hindawi tells no one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindawi</b></font>) meeting with Mansoura, and Sayyid is put in
prison for murder when Mansoura's body is found. Hindawi flees the area and works with the men laying pipe. One day,
Hindawi looks up at the bulldozer as it is lowering pipe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindawi</b></font>) grows
terrified. The pipe falls from the arm of the bulldozer and crushes him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindawi</b></font>). Just
before dying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindawi</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``Mansoura, you cruel one.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Because of this legend, the
men chant Mansoura's name as they lay pipe, to ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) help to make their
work easier. Zennouba awakes to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) husband is not in bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) starts to
think back on her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) life, especially her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) loss of freedom since puberty. In order
to keep their land in the family, she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) was married to her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) cousin Hagg. Sex with
Hagg was unpleasant, but eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagg</b></font>) began sleeping with the servant girls.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagg</b></font>) for a divorce, Hagg revealed that Zennouba's own father did
the same, so why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagg</b></font>) grant her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) a divorce? Zennouba's adoration and
reverence toward her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) father are wounded. She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) wonders if all women are doomed to
the same fate. Hagg returns to bed and Zennouba notices it's almost dawn. She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) wakes the
servant girl and asks her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) to fetch hot water for a bath. Zennouba thinks that
she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>), like the servant girl, was once beautiful. She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) has the girl scrub her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) back
so hard with a loofah that it is actually painful. The narrator's husband has been transferred to a country town. She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>)
journeys there to find a suitable house. A house on the canal resembles an image
from her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) dreams, and she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) wishes to occupy it. A young woman named Aneesa has
been squatting there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) child, and Aneesa tries to prevent the narrator
from entering. Kamil, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) husband's employees, tells the narrator that
the local people believe that spirits inhabit the house, but the narrator is
determined to live there. A short time later, the narrator returns to begin moving in. Once again,
Aneesa confronts the narrator, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) to leave. Eventually the authorities
come to take Aneesa and her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) child away, and Aneesa points under the house and
tells the narrator, <div class="bookquote">``I'll leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the narrator</b></font>)</div>One day, the narrator sees a huge, beautiful snake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) feels intoxicated
and elated at the sight, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) boards up the crack
where the snake has disappeared. A sheikh from the town is summoned. He (<font color='blue'><b>sheikh</b></font>) tells
the narrator that the snake is a female spirit, one of the monarchs of the
earth, and should be considered a blessing. The narrator is skeptical, but later
she (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) begins to fantasize about seeing the snake again. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) fulfills her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>)
duties as the woman of the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) becomes more isolated and sits around
lazily. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) fantasies become sexual and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) is consumed by a painful yearning
for the snake. The snake reappears and her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) sexual desires are fulfilled. However, the
narrator again tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) has seen a snake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) boards up a
hole in their bedroom wall. The snake later tells the narrator that there is no
sin in their actions, as they are now married and the narrator will have
<div class="bookquote">``abiding youth and the delights of love.''  (<font color='red'><b>the narrator</b></font>)</div>They carry on their love affair. The
narrator's vitality increases and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) is taken through worlds of unimaginable
beauty. Their affair lasts many months. Then the narrator's husband kills a snake, breaking the pact of peace
between snakes and man. The snake comes once more to bid the narrator goodbye,
in a passionate embrace, and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) they must leave. The narrator still
yearns for her (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) snake lover and hopes that one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Aneesa</b></font>) will reappear. Hassan is traveling by train to his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) hometown because his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) father has
recently died. Hassan thinks back to images of his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) father making ablutions
before daily prayer and of his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) father's pride in young Hassan. Then, Hassan
spent his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) adolescence with foreign tutors and his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) love for his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) father became
frozen. Hassan abandoned emotions and instead began to rule his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) life with reason
and rational standards. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) eventually opened an accounting office in Cairo and
hardly ever returned home. When his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) daughter was born, Hassan's father sent him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
a telegram saying to name her (<font color='blue'><b>Hassan</b></font>) Jasmine. Hassan's wife later left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and took
their daughter back to Turkey, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hassan</b></font>) homeland. The men of the town greet Hassan when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arrives for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's funeral.
The jasmine in the air causes him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to cough badly. The burial rites begin, and
tears come to Hassan's eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sees his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's body. The body is washed
and carried to the grave. It is Hassan's duty to cut the burial shroud away
before his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father is buried. As the men remember his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, Hassan thinks to
himself that they knew his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father better than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did. Hassan generously offers
to pay for a feast for all of the men. That night, Hassan finds that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father mentioned Jasmine in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
regrets that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never brought Jasmine to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father. Hassan also regrets
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not go on a pilgrimage with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, something that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father
mentioned once. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wakes during the night and thinks, <div class="bookquote">``Father, you gave me a
real beating tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>referring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) own emotional suffering as a result of
death and regrets. Aziza is a seventy-year-old spinster who lives with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) nephew, Mahmoud,
and their servant, Waheeba. Aziza had lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) brother, Saleh, until Saleh
and Mahmoud's parents died. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) then moved in with Mahmoud and now lives off of
their family savings. Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) hears of a death, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) attends the funeral,
regardless of whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) knew the person well, and leads the women in mourning.
This is the only time she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) leaves the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) spends most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) time yelling
at Waheeba or looking out the window, often scolding boys in the street. Mahmoud talks to Aziza about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) desire to privately tutor some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>)
students at home, but Aziza rejects the idea. Mahmoud, who is outwardly very
agreeable to Aziza, leaves to smoke in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) room and think about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) desire to
tutor a young girl in hopes of meeting one of their older sisters and possibly
finding a wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) secretly has sex with Waheeba at night and wonders if his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>)
aunt knows this is going on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) puts on some cologne, studies his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) face in the
mirror, and goes out. The call to prayer comes. Aziza no longer prays, thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) has
done much praying in her (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) life, and besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) has not committed the sins of
other women and has acquired much grace by attending so many funerals. Waheeba leaves to buy vegetables. This is her (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) time of freedom, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>)
can meet up with friends at the market, often retelling stories of the household
in such a way as to make it seem that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) has the upper hand. Meanwhile, Aziza
wonders what Waheeba during her (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) time away from the apartment. Aziza also
relishes the thought of how much money she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) has saved up for Mahmoud's
inheritance--over 54,000 pounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) is very proud and grows happy at the thought
of surprising him (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) someday. Aziza also ponders Mahmoud's relations with Waheeba,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) is well aware of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) decides it is best to hide both the amount of
money in the bank and her (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) knowledge of this affair. Aziza hopes to maintain the
current routine as long as possible. Suddenly, though, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aziza</b></font>) suffers a heart
attack, and sits clenched with terror, waiting for Mahmoud or Waheeba to
return. The narrator is a young girl. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grandmother buys her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) some rabbits. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
spends her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) time lying in the enclosure built for the rabbits, watching their
leisurely existence, and eventually they have babies. Of all the animals on
their farm, these are the only ones with which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has bonded. Then one day she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
sees Nanny Zareefa, the servant, cut the throat of one of the baby rabbits. The
narrator runs home, upset at the sight of the slaughter and the loss of its
life. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) realizes that for adults, there are degrees of death, varying in
importance between man and animals, and even between certain men and
others. Widad lives alone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) children have grown up and moved away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
husband Ahmed has died, so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lives a strict, unchanging routine, caring for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chickens and the property. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knows each chicken and its particular
characteristics. Widad regrets that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never learned the verses used in the
daily prayers and is too shy to ask the neighbors if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could join them in
their prayers, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) simple way she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still thanks and praises Allah. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
only interaction with others is when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sits on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bench outside and watches
people pass by. Mitwalli, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) childhood sweetheart, has come to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was younger, but her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father arranged for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to marry Ahmed,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not object. Widad tells Mitwalli that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ahmed</b></font>) should have come thirty
years ago, and they are both old now so it is too late. Mitwalli says that the
past is over, and they both have the right to live out the rest of their lives
happily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ahmed</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ahmed</b></font>) will come back tomorrow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) answer. Widad thinks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) should live the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) life alone. But suddenly
she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) notices a kite swoop down and grab one of the chicks from the courtyard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>)
is upset, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) only thoughts are about how to prevent this from happening
again. That night she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) has a vision of Mitwalli standing over the chickens to
protect them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) also dreams of standing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ahmed</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>Ahmed</b></font>) daily prayers,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) once did with Ahmed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) is filled with contentment. The narrator is an old woman who feels like a useless burden since her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>)
children have grown up. Today she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) decides to stay in bed, thinking that it makes
no difference if she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) doesn't get up. Every day she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) had the same routine, going
to the market for food and meeting the same people. Once a month she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) went to the
center of the city and bought a scarf or slippers, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) probably wouldn't
wear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) simply used the act of shopping to pass the time and actually
spends more and more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) time living in past memories. She (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) thinks of the gardener in her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) father's country house, spraying water
on the lime trees. The vision is interrupted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) daughter coming into the
room to ask if she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) has had a nice rest. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) son, too, approaches, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>)
children leave and close the door to the room. Later she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) hears the voice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>)
brother, who has not visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) in years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) also hears the voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife,
with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Widad</b></font>) doesn't get along. Finally a woman comes in and begins undressing
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and a reciter is reading the funeral verses from the Qur'an. A feeling of
peace flows over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) abandons herself to the funeral ritual.
