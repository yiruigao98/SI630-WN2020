The family sits in the car, which is stopped near a tea stall. Mr. and Mrs. Das are arguing about who should take their daughter, Tina, to the bathroom, and Mrs. Das ultimately takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>). Ronny, their son, darts out of the car to look at a goat. Mr. Das, who closely resembles Ronny, reprimands him (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) but does nothing to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>), even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) wants to give the goat a piece of gum. Mr. Das tells Bobby, the younger of their two sons, to go look after Ronny. When Bobby refuses, Mr. Das does nothing to enforce his (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) order. Mr. Das tells Mr. Kapasi that both he (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) wife were born and raised in the United States. Mr. Das also reveals that their parents now live in India and that the Das family visits them every few years. Tina comes back to the car, clutching a doll with shorn hair. Mr. Das asks Tina where her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) mother is, using Mrs. Das's first name, Mina. Mr. Kapasi notices that Mr. Das uses his (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) wife's first name, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) thinks it is an unusual way to speak to a child. While Mrs. Das buys some puffed rice from a nearby vendor, Mr. Das tells Mr. Kapasi that he (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) is a middle-school teacher in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Mr. Kapasi reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) has been a tour guide for five years. The group sets off. Tina plays with the locks in the back of the car, and Mrs. Das does not stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>). Mrs. Das sits in the car silently and eats her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) snack without offering any to anyone else. Along the road, they see monkeys, which Mr. Kapasi says are common in the area. Mr. Das has him (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) stop the car so he (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) can take a picture of a starving peasant. Mr. and Mrs. Das quarrel because Mr. Das has not gotten them a tour guide whose car has air-conditioning. Mr. Kapasi observes that Mr. and Mrs. Das are more like siblings to their children than parents. Mr. Kapasi tells the Dases about his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) other job as an interpreter in a doctor's office. Mrs. Das remarks that his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) job is romantic and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) about some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) patients. However, Mr. Kapasi views his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) job as a failure. At one time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) had been a scholar of many languages, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) remains fluent only in English. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) took the interpreting job as a way to pay the medical bills when his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) eldest son contracted typhoid and died at age seven. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) kept the job because the pay was better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) previous teaching job, but it reminds his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) wife of their son's death. Mr. Kapasi's marriage was arranged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) parents, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) wife have nothing in common. Mr. Kapasi, seduced by Mrs. Das's description of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) job as <div class="bookquote">``romantic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Das</b></font>)</div>begins fantasizing about Mrs. Das. When they stop for lunch, Mrs. Das insists that Mr. Kapasi sit with them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) does, and Mr. Das takes their picture together. Mrs. Das gets Mr. Kapasi's address so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) can send him (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) a copy of the picture, and Mr. Kapasi begins to daydream about how they will have a great correspondence that will, in a way, finally fulfill his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) dreams of being a diplomat between countries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) imagines the witty things he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) will write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) will reveal the unhappiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) marriage. At the temple, Mrs. Das talks with Mr. Kapasi as they stare at friezes of women in erotic poses. Mr. Kapasi admires her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) legs and continues to dream about their letters. Dreading taking the Dases back to their hotel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) suggests that they go see a nearby monastery, and they agree. When they arrive, the place is swarming with monkeys. Mr. Kapasi tells the children and Mr. Das that the monkeys are not dangerous as long as they are not fed. Mrs. Das stays in the car because her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) legs are tired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) sits in the front seat next to Mr. Kapasi and confesses to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) younger son, Bobby, is the product of an affair she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) had eight years ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) slept with a friend of Mr. Das's who came to visit while she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) was a lonely housewife, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) has never told anyone about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) tells Mr. Kapasi because he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) is an interpreter of maladies and she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) can help her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>). Mr. Kapasi's crush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) begins to evaporate. Mrs. Das reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) no longer loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) husband, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) has known since she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) was a young child, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) has destructive impulses toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) children and life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) asks Mr. Kapasi to suggest some remedy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) pain. Mr. Kapasi, insulted, asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) whether it isn't really just guilt she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) feels. Mrs. Das gets out of the car and joins her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) family. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) walks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) drops a trail of puffed rice. Meanwhile, the children and Mr. Das have been playing with the monkeys. When Mrs. Das rejoins them, Bobby is missing. They find him (<font color='blue'><b>Bobby</b></font>) surrounded by monkeys that have become crazed from Mrs. Das's puffed rice and are hitting Bobby on the legs with a stick he (<font color='blue'><b>Bobby</b></font>) had given them. Mr. Das accidentally takes a picture in his (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) nervousness, and Mrs. Das screams for Mr. Kapasi to do something. Mr. Kapasi chases off the monkeys and carries Bobby back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) family. Mrs. Das puts a bandage on Bobby's knee. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) reaches into her (<font color='blue'><b>Das</b></font>) handbag to get a hairbrush to straighten his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapasi</b></font>) hair, and the paper with Mr. Kapasi's address on it flutters away.
