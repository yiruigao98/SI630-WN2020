opens the novel by explaining that he was born on midnight, August
15, 1947, at the exact moment India gained its independence from
British rule. Now nearing his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) thirty-first birthday, Saleem believes
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) body is beginning to crack and fall apart. Fearing that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) death is imminent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) grows anxious to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) life story.
Padma, his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) loyal and loving companion, serves as his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) patient, often
skeptical audience. Saleem's story begins in Kashmir, thirty-two years before
his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) birth, in 1915. There, Saleem's grandfather, a doctor named
Aadam Aziz, begins treating Naseem, the woman who becomes Saleem's grandmother.
For the first three years Aadam Aziz treats her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>), Naseem is always
covered by a sheet with a small hole in it that is moved to expose
the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) that is sick. Aadam Azis sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Naseem</b></font>) future wife's
face for the first time on the same day World War I ends, in 1918.
Aadam Aziz and Naseem marry, and the couple moves to Agra, where
Aadam--a doctor whose loss of religious faith has affected him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) deeply--sees
how protests in the name of independence get violently suppressed.
Aadam and Naseem have three daughters, Alia, Mumtaz, and Emerald,
and two sons, Mustapha and Hanif. Aadam becomes a follower of the
optimistic activist Mian Abdullah, whose anti-Partition stance eventually
leads to his (<font color='blue'><b>Aadam</b></font>) assassination. Following Abdullah's death, Aadam hides
Abdullah's frightened assistant, Nadir Khan, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Aadam</b></font>) wife's
opposition. While living in the basement, Nadir Khan falls in love
with Mumtaz, and the two are secretly married. However, after two
years of marriage, Aadam finds out that his (<font color='blue'><b>Aadam</b></font>) daughter is still a
virgin, as Nadir and Mumtaz have yet to consummate their marriage.
Nadir Khan is sent running for his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) life when Mumtaz's sister, Emerald,
tells Major Zulfikar--an officer in the Pakistani army, soon to be
Emerald's husband--about his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hiding place in the house. Abandoned
by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband, Mumtaz agrees to marry Ahmed Sinai, a young merchant who
until then had been courting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sister, Alia. Mumtaz changes her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name to Amina and moves to Delhi with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
new husband. Pregnant, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) goes to a fortune-teller who delivers a
cryptic prophecy about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) unborn son, declaring that the boy will never
be older or younger than his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) country and claiming that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sees two
heads, knees and a nose. After a terrorist organization burns down
Ahmed's factory, Ahmed and Amina move to Bombay. They buy a house
from a departing Englishman, William Methwold, who owns an estate
at the top of a hill. Wee Willie Winky, a poor man who entertains
the families of Methwold's Estate, says that his (<font color='blue'><b>Methwold</b></font>) wife, Vanita, is
also expecting a child soon. Unbeknownst to Wee Willie Winky, Vanita
had an affair with William Methwold, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Methwold</b></font>) is the true father of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vanita</b></font>) unborn child. Amina and Vanita both go into labor, and, at exactly
midnight, each woman delivers a son. Meanwhile, a midwife at the
nursing home, Mary Pereira, is preoccupied with thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
radical socialist lover, Joseph D'Costa. Wanting to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) proud,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) switches the nametags of the two newborn babies, thereby giving
the poor baby a life of privilege and the rich baby a life of poverty.
Driven by a sense of guilt afterward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) becomes an ayah, or nanny,
to Saleem. Because it occurs at the exact moment India gains its
independence, the press heralds Saleem's birth as hugely significant.
Young Saleem has an enormous cucumberlike nose and blue eyes like
those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) grandfather, Aadam Aziz. His (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) mischievous sister, nicknamed the
Brass Monkey, is born a few years later. Overwhelmed by the expectations
laid on him (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) by the prophecy, and ridiculed by other children for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) huge nose, Saleem takes to hiding in a washing chest. While
hiding one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) mother sitting down on the toilet; when
Amina discovers him (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Amina</b></font>) punishes Saleem to one day of silence.
Unable to speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) hears, for the first time, a babble of voices
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) has the power of telepathy and can enter
anyone's thoughts. Eventually, Saleem begins to hear the thoughts
of other children born during the first hour of independence. The
1,001 midnight's children--a number reduced to 581 by their tenth
birthday--all have magical powers, which vary according to how close
to midnight they were born. Saleem discovers that Shiva, the boy
with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) was switched at birth, was born with a pair of enormous,
powerful knees and a gift for combat. One day, Saleem loses a portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) finger in an accident
and is rushed to the hospital, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) parents learn that according
to Saleem's blood type, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) couldn't possibly be their biological
son. After he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) leaves the hospital, Saleem is sent to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>)
Uncle Hanif and Aunt Pia for a while. Shortly after Saleem returns
home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) parents, Hanif commits suicide. While the family mourns
Hanif's death, Mary confesses to having switched Saleem and Shiva
at birth. Ahmed--now an alcoholic--grows violent with Amina, prompting her (<font color='blue'><b>Amina</b></font>)
to take Saleem and the Brass Monkey to Pakistan, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amina</b></font>) moves
in with Emerald. In Pakistan, Saleem watches as Emerald's husband,
General Zulfikar, stages a coup against the Pakistani government
and ushers in a period of martial law. Four years later, after Ahmed suffers a heart failure,
Amina and the children move back to Bombay. India goes to war with
China, while Saleem's perpetually congested nose undergoes a medical operation.
As a result, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) telepathic powers but, in return, gains
an incredible sense of smell, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) can detect emotions. Saleem's entire family moves to Pakistan after India's
military loss to China. His (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) younger sister, now known as Jamila
Singer, becomes the most famous singer in Pakistan. Already on the
brink of ruin, Saleem's entire family--save Jamila and himself--dies
in the span of a single day during the war between India and Pakistan. During
the air raids, Saleem gets hit in the head by his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) grandfather's silver
spittoon, which erases his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) memory entirely. Relieved of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) memory, Saleem is reduced to an animalistic
state. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) finds himself conscripted into military service, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>)
keen sense of smell makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) an excellent tracker. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) doesn't
know exactly how he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) came to join the army, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) suspects that Jamila
sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) there as a punishment for having fallen in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jamila</b></font>).
While in the army, Saleem helps quell the independence movement
in Bangladesh. After witnessing a number of atrocities, however,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) flees into the jungle with three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) fellow soldiers. In the
jungle of the Sundarbans, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) regains all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) memory except the
knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) name. After leaving the jungle, Saleem finds Parvati-the-witch,
one of midnight's children, who reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) name and helps
him (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) escape back to India. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) lives with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jamila</b></font>) in the magician's ghetto,
along with a snake charmer named Picture Singh. Disappointed that Saleem will not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jamila</b></font>), Parvati-the-witch has
an affair with Shiva, now a famous war hero. Things between Parvati
and Shiva quickly sour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) returns to the magicians' ghetto,
pregnant and still unmarried. There, the ghetto residents shun Parvati
until Saleem agrees to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>). Meanwhile, Indira Gandhi, the
prime minister of India, begins a sterilization campaign. Shortly
after the birth of Parvati's son, the government destroys the magician's
ghetto. Parvati dies while Shiva captures Saleem and brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>)
to a forced sterilization camp. There, Saleem divulges the names
of the other midnight's children. One by one, the midnight's children
are rounded up and sterilized, effectively destroying the powers
that so threaten the prime minister. Later, however, Indira Gandhi
loses the first election she (<font color='blue'><b>Gandhi</b></font>) holds. The midnight's children, including Saleem, are all set
free. Saleem goes in search of Parvati's son, Aadam, who has been
living with Picture Singh. The three take a trip to Bombay, so Picture
Singh can challenge a man who claims to be the world's greatest
snake charmer. While in Bombay, Saleem eats some chutney that tastes exactly
like the ones his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) ayah, Mary, used to make. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) finds the chutney
factory that Mary now owns, at which Padma stands guarding the gate.
With this meeting, Saleem's story comes full circle. His (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) historical
account finally complete, Saleem decides to marry Padma, his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) steadfast
lover and listener, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) thirty-first birthday, which falls on
the thirty-first anniversary of India's independence. Saleem prophesies
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Saleem</b></font>) will die on that day, disintegrating into millions of specks
of dust.
