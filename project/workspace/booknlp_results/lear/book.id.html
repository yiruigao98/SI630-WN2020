to step down from the throne and divide his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) kingdom evenly among
his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) three daughters. First, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) puts his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) daughters through
a test, asking each to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) how much she (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). Goneril
and Regan, Lear's older daughters, give their father flattering
answers. But Cordelia, Lear's youngest and favorite daughter, remains
silent, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) has no words to describe how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) loves
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) father. Lear flies into a rage and disowns Cordelia. The king
of France, who has courted Cordelia, says that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) still wants to
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) even without her (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) land, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) accompanies him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to France
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) father's blessing. Lear quickly learns that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made a bad decision. Goneril
and Regan swiftly begin to undermine the little authority that Lear
still holds. Unable to believe that his (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>) beloved daughters are betraying him (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>),
Lear slowly goes insane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>) flees his (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>) daughters' houses to wander
on a heath during a great thunderstorm, accompanied by his (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>) Fool
and by Kent, a loyal nobleman in disguise. Meanwhile, an elderly nobleman named Gloucester also experiences
family problems. His (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) illegitimate son, Edmund, tricks him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) into believing
that his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) legitimate son, Edgar, is trying to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>). Fleeing the
manhunt that his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) father has set for him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>), Edgar disguises himself
as a crazy beggar and calls himself <div class="bookquote">``Poor Tom.''  (<font color='red'><b>a beggar</b></font>)</div>Like Lear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heads
out onto the heath. When the loyal Gloucester realizes that Lear's daughters
have turned against their father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) decides to help Lear in spite
of the danger. Regan and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) husband, Cornwall, discover him (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>) helping Lear,
accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>) of treason, blind him (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>), and turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>) out to wander the
countryside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>) ends up being led by his (<font color='blue'><b>Regan</b></font>) disguised son, Edgar, toward
the city of Dover, where Lear has also been brought. In Dover, a French army lands as part of an invasion led
by Cordelia in an effort to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) father. Edmund apparently becomes romantically
entangled with both Regan and Goneril, whose husband, Albany, is
increasingly sympathetic to Lear's cause. Goneril and Edmund conspire
to kill Albany. The despairing Gloucester tries to commit suicide, but
Edgar saves him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) by pulling the strange trick of leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) off
an imaginary cliff. Meanwhile, the English troops reach Dover, and
the English, led by Edmund, defeat the Cordelia-led French. Lear
and Cordelia are captured. In the climactic scene, Edgar duels with
and kills Edmund; we learn of the death of Gloucester; Goneril poisons Regan
out of jealousy over Edmund and then kills herself when her (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) treachery
is revealed to Albany; Edmund's betrayal of Cordelia leads to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>)
needless execution in prison; and Lear finally dies out of grief
at Cordelia's passing. Albany, Edgar, and the elderly Kent are left
to take care of the country under a cloud of sorrow and regret.
