The story is narrated by the Lawyer, the man who employs Bartleby. The Lawyer has two other scriveners, Turkey and Nippers, and an errand boy, Ginger Nut. As the story begins, the Lawyer realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) needs another copyist. A strange young man named Bartleby answers the ad, and the Lawyer hires him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>). Bartleby writes swiftly and accurately for the first few days. All copies must be examined for accuracy, and the Lawyer calls in Bartleby and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) to examine a document; Bartleby replies, <div class="bookquote">``I would prefer not to.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bartleby</b></font>)</div>This reply surprises the Lawyer so much he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) can't respond. Later, when a large document must be examined and all the copyists are lined up to examine each page, the Lawyer again calls in Bartleby, who again replies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``would prefer not to''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>examine the document. The Lawyer knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) should fire Bartleby, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) is so puzzled by the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) allows him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) to continue working. The Lawyer begins to notice other odd habits about Bartleby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) never eats anything, except snacks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) never leaves the office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) still refuses to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) own papers, always saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) prefers not to. When stopping by the office on a Sunday, the Lawyer discovers that Bartleby has been living there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) pities for Bartleby's cheerless life, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) is still troubled. A few days later, Bartleby tells the Lawyer he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) is going to stop writing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) gives Bartleby his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) salary and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) to leave. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) returns to the office after hours, Bartleby is still there. The Lawyer points out the injustice of Bartleby's remaining in the office when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) refuses to work. Bartleby hides in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) corner, and the Lawyer cannot bring himself to force Bartleby out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) decides to let Bartleby remain in the office, doing nothing. But after the Lawyer's friends and clients make some unpleasant remarks about the squatter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) office, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) realizes that allowing Bartleby to stay is bad for business. The only answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) can find is, if the scrivener will not leave, then the Lawyer will have to buy a new office. A few days after the move, the Lawyer is confronted by a small mob of people who inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) that Bartleby is now hanging around inside the building all day. The Lawyer speaks to Bartleby again, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) that either he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) must leave the building, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) will be arrested. The Lawyer even invites Bartleby to stay at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) own home, but Bartleby refuses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) is arrested as a vagrant and sent to prison. The Lawyer visits him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>), but Bartleby wants nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>). Later, the Lawyer again visits Bartleby, who is sleeping outside in the prison yard. Upon reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) discovers Bartleby has died. The Lawyer tells the reader that sometime after Bartleby's death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) heard a rumor that the scrivener had once been a clerk in the Dead Letter office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) wonders whether such a depressing job might have driven the man to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) deranged behavior. <div class="bookquote">``The Encantadas''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>consists of ten <div class="bookquote">``sketches,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or short accounts, about the Galapagos Islands. Each sketch describes either a particular island or a particular characteristic or inhabitant of an island. The sketches are based mostly on Melville's own experience as a sailor, having visited the Galapagos. Each sketch is preceded by several lines of verse, usually from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queen. The first sketch describes the whole Galapagos region in general. The islands were formed by volcanoes, and are mostly dusty and barren, with a few lush spots here and there. They were once a popular resort for pirates raiding the South American coast. Because of their many peculiar features, some sailors believe the Galapagos to be <div class="bookquote">``enchanted.''  (<font color='red'><b>some sailors</b></font>)</div>The primary inhabitants of the islands are reptiles. The second sketch describes three tortoises that were brought onto the ship. The narrator spent much time examining the tortoises, and was fascinated by them. The next day, the tortoises were killed and eaten, and their shells made into giant bowls. The third sketch describes the <div class="bookquote">``Rock Redondo,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a tall rock that stands on one of the islands. Over two hundred feet high, the rock provides an excellent view of the surrounding islands. The narrator lists the various sea birds that inhabit the Rock. In the fourth sketch, the narrator climbs the Rock Redondo. As he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) invites the reader to gaze at the islands, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) tells the story of how the Galapagos Islands were discovered, when mariners decided to sail farther out from the continent to avoid the dangerous currents from Peru to Chile. The fifth sketch tells the story of the U.S.S. Essex and how, during the War of 1812, it spotted a ship near the Galapagos Islands. The captain believed it to be an enemy ship, although it unfurled an American flag; but as they approached, currents dragged the Essex away. When they returned, the ship had British flags flying. A sudden breeze allowed the ship to escape. It was never seen again, and so the sailors believed it was enchanted. The sixth sketch describes Barrington Isle, a popular spot for pirates. It is small, but it has many plants, animals, and areas of fresh water, and it makes for good fishing. The seventh sketch tells the story of Charles's Isle. It is almost as lush and productive as Barrington, and much larger. Charles's Isle was given to an adventurer who fought for Peru in its revolt against Spain. The adventurer called for pilgrims to populate the island, and he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) started a new colony. The adventurer took twenty attack-dogs with him (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>). Soon the colony went sour, since criminals were amongst the colonists, he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) formed a bodyguard from some of the best men of the colony, but even they turned traitor, and finally a great battle was held between the colonists and the dogs. The adventurer lost and was exiled by the populace. As time wore on, the colony began to lure sailors away from unsuspecting ships that stopped at Charles's Isle for water or supplies, and soon any wise ship captain stayed away from the island. The eighth sketch is another story, this one describing the <div class="bookquote">``Chola widow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hunilla</b></font>)</div>Hunilla. The narrator's ship spots a lone woman on an island, and they pick her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been marooned on the island months earlier when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, newly-wed, had been on a cruise. They had come near the Galapagos Islands, and the woman's husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother had wanted to stay at one of the islands and collect valuable tortoise oil. The French captain agreed to drop them off with some supplies, and then to pick them up on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) return trip four months later. The husband and brother had collected a lot of tortoise oil, so they decided to celebrate with a fishing trip in a makeshift boat. It sank, and both men drowned. The French ship never returned. The narrator's ship drops Hunilla off on the mainland, where they give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the money for the tortoise oil and a little of their own cash besides. The ninth sketch tells the story of Hood's Isle and Oberlus, a hermit. Oberlus is a former sailor who deserted to Hood's Isle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hood</b></font>) lived on the island growing small potatoes and other crops, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hood</b></font>) sold to passing sailors. Eventually Oberlus fancied himself a king and wanted subjects, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Hood</b></font>) kidnaps four sailors and presses them into service, using his (<font color='blue'><b>Hood</b></font>) musket to frighten them into submission. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hood</b></font>) later arms them with cutlasses and leads them as pirates. One day, two large ships come in, sending four small boats to get supplies from Oberlus. Oberlus steals one of the boats. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hood</b></font>) escapes to the mainland of Peru, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Hood</b></font>) suspicious character gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Hood</b></font>) away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hood</b></font>) is thrown in jail. In the tenth and final sketch, the narrator describes many of the runaways, castaways, and other human-related features of the islands, such as grave markers and messages-in-a-bottle. In <div class="bookquote">``Benito Cereno,''  (<font color='red'><b>the narrator</b></font>)</div>the narrator is Amasa Delano, the captain of a Massachusetts whaling ship. When the story begins, Captain Delano and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ship, the Bachelor's Delight, are anchored off an island near Chile. They spot another ship coming toward the island, floating rather listlessly. Delano decides to take a boat over and investigate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) men reach the ship, the San Dominick. Delano boards the ship, and immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Dominick</b></font>) is accosted by both sailors and black slaves, all begging for water and supplies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dominick</b></font>) sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Dominick</b></font>) men back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dominick</b></font>) own ship for supplies and tries to find out what happened to the San Dominick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dominick</b></font>) meets its captain, Benito Cereno. Cereno seems strange, very nervous and somewhat aloof. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) behavior constantly puzzles Delano. Cereno is constantly attended by Babo, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) young black servant, who helps Cereno when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) has fainting spells. Delano is a kind man, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) persuades himself that Cereno's behavior is a result of the troubles he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) has suffered. Cereno tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) that the ship had left Buenos Aires six months earlier. While rounding Cape Horn, they struck heavy winds, so to lighten the ship they threw supplies overboard, including much of their fresh water. While telling this story, Cereno has one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) many coughing fits, which makes Delano believe that Cereno is both sick and perhaps mentally troubled. Cereno finishes the story, claiming that the ship spent months on the sea with no wind, and that all the officers and most of the crew died from scurvy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) concludes by praising Babo as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) faithful companion through it all. Delano tells Cereno he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) will help him (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) reach the nearest port. This briefly cheers up Cereno, but Babo draws him (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) aside, and when Cereno returns he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) is again morose. As Delano investigates the ship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) begins to have suspicious feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) sees a young slave hit a white cabin boy, and chides Cereno for allowing this to happen. Cereno makes no effort to punish the attacker. Delano inquires as to the owner of the slaves; Cereno says that they belonged to Alexander Aranda, a friend of Cereno's who died of the fever. Cereno rather rudely begins whispering with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) servant. Delano believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) is the subject of their conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) wonders if Cereno is actually some low- born adventurer, masquerading as a ship captain, perhaps planning to murder Delano and then take his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) ship. But the good-natured Delano dismisses the idea, even after Cereno asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) some suspicious questions, such as how many men his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) ship holds and whether they would be present on it that night. Delano again dismisses his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) suspicions as silly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) witnesses several strange events, including two blacks pushing a sailor to the ground. Cereno always ignores these incidents or brushes them off. Delano thinks the Spanish sailors are giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) meaningful glances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) tries to question them, but the slaves crowd them out. Delano questions Cereno further and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) mentions Cape Horn, Cereno responds, <div class="bookquote">``Who spoke of Cape Horn?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cereno/Benito Cereno</b></font>)</div>Cereno corrects himself, but Delano's suspicions are further aroused. Delano has lunch with Cereno, and is annoyed that Cereno refuses to dismiss Babo so they can talk in private. The wind returns, and Delano pilots the San Dominick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) own ship. Delano calls for a boat to be lowered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) ship with supplies for the San Dominick. The supplies are delivered, and Delano prepares to leave the San Dominick. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dominick</b></font>) gets into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dominick</b></font>) boat, Cereno leaps over the side of the San Dominick and falls at the captain's feet. Babo also leaps over, with a dagger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) hands. Delano's men stop Babo. Delano realizes that Babo intended to stab Cereno, not himself. Delano sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) men to recover the ship. The rest of the story consists mostly of Cereno's court deposition, revealing the truth about the San Dominick. The slaves had revolted, led by Babo and Atufal, killing most of the Spanish crew and taking control of the ship. They forced Cereno to sail toward Senegal, where they planned to escape. But they needed supplies. Babo would not let Cereno come to a port that would put the ship in view of people, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) chose to sail to the island of Santa Maria. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) told Babo he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) was planning on getting supplies, but in actuality he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) hoped a passing vessel would save them. In the meantime, the slaves killed their owner and master, Alexandro Aranda, and hung his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) corpse on the figurehead to serve as a warning to the other sailors -LRB-this was covered before Delano came to the ship-RRB-. When the Bachelor's Delight came near, Babo gave Cereno a story to tell, as well as the other sailors, then set up the masquerade of himself as a servant to Cereno, so as to keep an eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>). Cereno and all the sailors were threatened with instant death if they give anything away. Cereno struggled between wanting to tell Delano the truth and the constant threat of Babo. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) leapt overboard into Delano's boat, thus ending the charade. At the end of the trial, Babo is executed and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) head placed on a pole. Cereno falls into a deep depression, and a few months later he (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) dies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) did indeed <div class="bookquote">``follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Cereno</b></font>) leader.''
