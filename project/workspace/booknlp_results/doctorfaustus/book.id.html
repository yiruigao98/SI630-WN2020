German scholar, grows dissatisfied
with the limits of traditional forms of knowledge--logic, medicine,
law, and religion--and decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) wants to learn to practice magic.
His (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) friends Valdes and Cornelius instruct him (<font color='blue'><b>Valdes</b></font>) in the black arts,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Valdes</b></font>) begins his (<font color='blue'><b>Valdes</b></font>) new career as a magician by summoning up Mephastophilis,
a devil. Despite Mephastophilis's warnings about the horrors of
hell, Faustus tells the devil to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) master, Lucifer,
with an offer of Faustus's soul in exchange for twenty-four years
of service from Mephastophilis. Meanwhile, Wagner, Faustus's servant,
has picked up some magical ability and uses it to press a clown
named Robin into his (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) service. Mephastophilis returns to Faustus with word that Lucifer
has accepted Faustus's offer. Faustus experiences some misgivings
and wonders if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) should repent and save his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) soul; in the end, though,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) agrees to the deal, signing it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) blood. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>)
does so, the words <div class="bookquote">``Homo fuge,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Latin for <div class="bookquote">``O man, fly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>appear branded
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm. Faustus again has second thoughts, but Mephastophilis bestows
rich gifts on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and gives him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a book of spells to learn. Later,
Mephastophilis answers all of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) questions about the nature of
the world, refusing to answer only when Faustus asks him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who made
the universe. This refusal prompts yet another bout of misgivings
in Faustus, but Mephastophilis and Lucifer bring in personifications
of the Seven Deadly Sins to prance about in front of Faustus, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) is impressed enough to quiet his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) doubts. Armed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) new powers and attended by Mephastophilis, Faustus
begins to travel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) goes to the pope's court in Rome, makes himself
invisible, and plays a series of tricks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) disrupts the pope's banquet
by stealing food and boxing the pope's ears. Following this incident,
he (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) travels through the courts of Europe, with his (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) fame spreading
as he (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) goes. Eventually, he (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) is invited to the court of the German
emperor, Charles V -LRB-the enemy of the pope-RRB-, who asks Faustus to
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) to see Alexander the Great, the famed fourth-century b.c. Macedonian
king and conqueror. Faustus conjures up an image of Alexander, and
Charles is suitably impressed. A knight scoffs at Faustus's powers,
and Faustus chastises him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) by making antlers sprout from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head.
Furious, the knight vows revenge. Meanwhile, Robin, Wagner's clown, has picked up some
magic on his (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) own, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) fellow stablehand, Rafe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) undergoes
a number of comic misadventures. At one point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) manages to summon
Mephastophilis, who threatens to turn Robin and Rafe into animals
-LRB-or perhaps even does transform them; the text isn't clear-RRB- to punish
them for their foolishness. Faustus then goes on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rafe</b></font>) travels, playing a trick
on a horse-courser along the way. Faustus sells him (<font color='blue'><b>Rafe</b></font>) a horse that
turns into a heap of straw when ridden into a river. Eventually,
Faustus is invited to the court of the Duke of Vanholt, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rafe</b></font>)
performs various feats. The horse-courser shows up there, along
with Robin, a man named Dick -LRB-Rafe in the A text-RRB-, and various others
who have fallen victim to Faustus's trickery. But Faustus casts
spells on them and sends them on their way, to the amusement of
the duke and duchess. As the twenty-four years of his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) deal with Lucifer come
to a close, Faustus begins to dread his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) impending death. He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) has
Mephastophilis call up Helen of Troy, the famous beauty from the
ancient world, and uses her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) presence to impress a group of scholars.
An old man urges Faustus to repent, but Faustus drives him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away.
Faustus summons Helen again and exclaims rapturously about her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) beauty.
But time is growing short. Faustus tells the scholars about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pact, and they are horror-stricken and resolve to pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
On the final night before the expiration of the twenty-four years,
Faustus is overcome by fear and remorse. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begs for mercy, but
it is too late. At midnight, a host of devils appears and carries
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul off to hell. In the morning, the scholars find Faustus's
limbs and decide to hold a funeral for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
