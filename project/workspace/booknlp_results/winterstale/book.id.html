Polixenes protests that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) has been away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) kingdom for nine months, but after Leontes's pregnant wife, Hermione, pleads with him (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) relents and agrees to stay a little longer. Leontes, meanwhile, has become possessed with jealousy--convinced that Polixenes and Hermione are lovers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) orders his (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) loyal retainer, Camillo, to poison the Bohemian king. Instead, Camillo warns Polixenes of what is afoot, and the two men flee Sicilia immediately. Furious at their escape, Leontes now publicly accuses his (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) wife of infidelity, and declares that the child she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is bearing must be illegitimate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) throws her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in prison, over the protests of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) nobles, and sends to the Oracle of Delphi for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) is sure will be confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) suspicions. Meanwhile, the queen gives birth to a girl, and her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) loyal friend Paulina brings the baby to the king, in the hopes that the sight of the child will soften his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) only grows angrier, however, and orders Paulina's husband, Lord Antigonus, to take the child and abandon it in some desolate place. While Antigonus is gone, the answer comes from Delphi--Hermione and Polixenes are innocent, and Leontes will have no heir until his (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) lost daughter is found. As this news is revealed, word comes that Leontes's son, Mamillius, has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) mother. Hermione, meanwhile, falls in a swoon, and is carried away by Paulina, who subsequently reports the queen's death to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) heartbroken and repentant husband. Antigonus, meanwhile abandons the baby on the Bohemian coast, reporting that Hermione appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in a dream and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) name the girl Perdita and leave gold and other tokens on her (<font color='blue'><b>Perdita</b></font>) person. Shortly thereafter, Antigonus is killed by a bear, and Perdita is raised by a kindly Shepherd. Sixteen years pass, and the son of Polixenes, Prince Florizel, falls in love with Perdita. His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) father and Camillo attend a sheepshearing in disguise and watch as Florizel and Perdita are betrothed--then, tearing off the disguise, Polixenes intervenes and orders his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) son never to see the Shepherd's daughter again. With the aid of Camillo, however, who longs to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) native land again, Florizel and Perdita take ship for Sicilia, after using the clothes of a local rogue, Autolycus, as a disguise. They are joined in their voyage by the Shepherd and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) son, a Clown, who are directed there by Autolycus. In Sicilia, Leontes--still in mourning after all this time--greets the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) old friend effusively. Florizel pretends to be on a diplomatic mission from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, but his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cover is blown when Polixenes and Camillo, too, arrive in Sicilia. What happens next is told to us by gentlemen of the Sicilian court: the Shepherd tells everyone his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) story of how Perdita was found, and Leontes realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Perdita</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) daughter, leading to general rejoicing. The entire company then goes to Paulina's house in the country, where a statue of Hermione has been recently finished. The sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>) wife's form makes Leontes distraught, but then, to everyone's amazement, the statue comes to life--it is Hermione, restored to life. As the play ends, Paulina and Camillo are engaged, and the whole company celebrates the miracle.
