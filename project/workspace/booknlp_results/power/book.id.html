After his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother suffers from a nervous breakdown, the five-year-old Peekay is brought up by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Zulu nanny Mary Mandoma and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Granpa on a farm in the province of Natal. Soon after, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is sent to an Afrikaans boarding school, where--as the youngest of all the students, and the only English-speaker--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is brutally tortured by the other boys. The Judge, a senior boy called Jaapie Botha, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Botha</b></font>) so-called <div class="bookquote">``stormtroopers''  (<font color='red'><b>Jaapie Botha/Botha/Jaapie</b></font>)</div>punish Peekay for his (<font color='blue'><b>Botha</b></font>) bedwetting habit and his (<font color='blue'><b>Botha</b></font>) circumcised penis by means of constant verbal and physical abuse. They call him (<font color='blue'><b>Botha</b></font>) derogatory names in Afrikaans such as <div class="bookquote">``pisskop''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-piss head-RRB- and <div class="bookquote">``rooinek''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-redneck-RRB-, a term used for Englishmen during the Boer War -LRB-fought between the British and the Boers, or Afrikaners-RRB-. The Judge, who wears a swastika tattoo on his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) arm, convinces the innocent Peekay that Hitler is on a mission to march all Englishmen into the sea and to restore glory to the Afrikaners. Mevrou, the Afrikaans woman who runs the boarding house, walks around brandishing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) deadly <div class="bookquote">``sjambok''  (<font color='red'><b>the Afrikaans woman</b></font>)</div>-LRB-cane stick-RRB-, instead of offering solace. Peekay returns home after his (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) first year of school, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) nanny commissions the famous black chief Inkosi-Inkosikazi to solve Peekay's bedwetting dilemma. Not only does Inkosi-Inkosikazi manage this, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) also opens Peekay's mind to a special place of <div class="bookquote">``dreaming'' (<font color='red'><b>Peekay</b></font>)</div>-a place of three waterfalls and ten stones-where Peekay may always find him (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>). Peekay returns to school the following year with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) problem solved, with Granpa Chook one of Inkosi-Inkosikazi's magic chicken, and with the independent spirit he (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) refers to as the <div class="bookquote">``power of one.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Granpa Chook becomes Peekay's only friend at school, and Mevrou allows him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to live in the kitchen where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) keeps the cockroaches at bay. Peekay excels at school, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has learnt that surviving the system means one has to adopt a camouflage-he thus hides his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brilliance. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) soon finds himself doing all the Judge's homework, which only serves to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) intelligence. This does nothing to quash the Judge's hatred for Peekay-on the contrary, at the end of the schoolyear the Judge forces to Peekay to eat human feces, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) kills Granpa Chook with a catapult. Traumatized, Peekay longs to arrive home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) nanny's embracing arms. But Mevrou tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) that there has been a change of plans: he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) is to head to the Eastern Transvaal town of Barberton, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) Granpa awaits him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>). Peekay's name is coined by Harry Crown, a Jewish man where Mevrou takes Peekay to buy shoes before the trip home-Harry Crown says that <div class="bookquote">``Pisskop''  (<font color='red'><b>Peekay</b></font>)</div>is not a respectable name for a young man, and dubs him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``PK''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>instead. On the train to Barberton, Peekay meets Hoppie Groenewald, boxing champion of the railways. Hoppie shows Peekay his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) boxing gloves, and invites the boy to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) box a man called Jackhammer Smit in Gravelotte, a stop on the way to Barberton. Peekay's dream to become welterweight champion of the world is born. He (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) commits Hoppie's advice-<div class="bookquote">``First with the head, then with the heart'' (<font color='red'><b>Hoppie</b></font>)</div>-to memory. At the Barberton train station, Peekay's mother welcomes him-she has returned from the mental institution, and has become a born-again Christian. Peekay discovers from Dum and Dee, the Shangaan kitchen servants, that Peekay's mother dismissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dee</b></font>) nanny because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) refused to give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life to the Lord. Peekay's mother begins trying to proselytize Peekay, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mother that the Lord is a <div class="bookquote">``shithead.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lord</b></font>)</div>In the hills behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) new house, Peekay meets an old German music professor, Karl von Vollensteen, who introduces himself as Doc and explains that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) collects cacti. Doc and Peekay become firm friends -LRB-along with Mrs. Boxall, the town librarian-RRB-, and when Doc is taken to the Barberton prison since he (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) never registered as a foreign alien, Peekay visits him (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) for music lessons. The prison has a boxing squad where Peekay begins lessons under the special instruction of a Cape colored man, Geel Piet. Peekay quickly develops into an outstanding boxer, leading the team-the Barberton Blues-to victory. Peekay has great compassion for the black prisoners, and works out a black market scheme with Geel Piet and Doc for tobacco and letters. In such a way, Peekay becomes a legend among black South Africans - they believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Piet</b></font>) is a chief, the <div class="bookquote">``Onoshobishobi Ingelosi''  (<font color='red'><b>a chief Ingelosi</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Tadpole Angel.''  (<font color='red'><b>a chief Ingelosi</b></font>)</div>One of the white prison wardens suspects that some illegal activity is underway, and one night Peekay discovers Geel Piet has been murdered in the boxing gym by the violent warder Borman. World War II ends, and Doc finds himself free once again. Doc, Mrs. Boxall, and a Jewish schoolteacher Miss Bornstein develop Peekay's precocious intellect through music, literature, chess, and science. To the delight of the town, Peekay passes his (<font color='blue'><b>Piet</b></font>) Royal College of Music exams and also wins the Eastern Transvaal under-twelve boxing title. With the help of his (<font color='blue'><b>Piet</b></font>) mentors, Peekay wins a scholarship to the prestigious Prince of Wales school in Johannesburg. Book Two of the novel describes Peekay's experiences at the Prince of Wales school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) quickly partners up with the son of a Jewish multimillionaire, Morrie Levy. Peekay and Morrie take the school by storm-Peekay's boxing talent reforms the pathetic Prince of Wales boxing team, and Morrie becomes Peekay's manager. Soon the two boys have a lucrative gambling business set up, as well as all kinds of other <div class="bookquote">``scams''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>which bring in enough money for Peekay to begin boxing lessons with South Africa's top coach, Solly Goldman. Peekay becomes a stranger to failure, excelling at boxing, rugby, and academics. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) must face Doc's death towards the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) school career as well as the disappointment of not winning a Rhodes scholarship to attend Oxford University. Book Three traces Peekay's life in Northern Rhodesia -LRB-present-day Zimbabwe-RRB- where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rhodes</b></font>) takes on a dangerous -LRB-but lucrative-RRB- job as a <div class="bookquote">``grizzly man''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in the mines in order to build up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boxing, and to earn enough money to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way through three years at Oxford. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forms a close friendship with a Russian miner, Rasputin, who eventually saves Peekay during a mining catastrophe, killing himself in the process. Peekay recovers but, before leaving the mines, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discovers that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been working for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old nemesis, Jaapie Botha. Peekay fights Jaapie and knocks him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaapie</b></font>) out. Over Botha's swastika tattoo, Peekay chisels a Union Jack and the letters <div class="bookquote">``PK'' (<font color='red'><b>a Union Jack PK</b></font>)</div>.
