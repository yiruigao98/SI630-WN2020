Suffolk has returned from France with Margaret, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) presents to the king as his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) new wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) also brings a peace treaty from France, which Gloucester reads. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) falters when he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) comes to a passage about the French keeping the territories of Anjou and Maine in return for Margaret. Gloucester is upset at this loss of land, once hard-won by Henry V and by the other lords in recent French wars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) prophecies the imminent loss of France and leaves. Beaufort speaks against Gloucester, suggesting to Buckingham and Somerset that they plot to oust him (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>). Salisbury and Warwick talk with York about trying to suppress the influence of Suffolk and Beaufort, two ambitious and prideful nobles. York, left alone, speaks of his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) belief in his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) claim to the throne and his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) frustration that Henry willingly allows lands that are rightfully his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own to be returned to the French. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) can't make his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) claims yet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) plans to side with Warwick and Salisbury. Gloucester speaks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) wife, the Duchess. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) had a dream that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) staff of office was broken, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) dreamed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was about to be crowned queen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) not to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) excessive ambition, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) is already the second woman in the kingdom, behind Margaret. Hume enters, and the Duchess and Hume discuss her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) desire to hire a witch and conjurer to summon spirits to ask about the future of Henry's reign. Petitioners come to the court to ask for Gloucester's help. They encounter Suffolk and Margaret and believe Suffolk is Gloucester. One petitioner, Peter, accuses his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) boss of saying York is the rightful king, and Suffolk sees he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) has found a way to weaken York. Henry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) court enter, discussing who should be the regent of English forces in France. Gloucester suggests York, but after hearing Peter accusing his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) master Horner and casting doubt on York, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) recommends Somerset. Margaret insults Gloucester and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is still protector of the kingdom; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) also insults the Duchess. Gloucester suggests that justice will be best served by single combat between Peter and Horner. The Duchess welcomes the Witch and the conjurer, Bolingbroke. They summon a spirit and ask it Margaret's questions about Henry's rule. The spirit gives ambiguous replies, then York, Suffolk, and Somerset enter and arrest the Duchess for dabbling in the occult. Henry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) queen and lords are hunting. Gloucester and Beaufort bicker. They meet a poor man who claims to have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sight restored by miracle, but Gloucester sees he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is lying and chases him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) away, <div class="bookquote">``curing''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lameness, too. Then, Buckingham arrives with news of the Duchess' arrest. Richard speaks to Warwick and Salisbury, explaining the complex family tree that makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) the more rightful heir to the throne than Henry. Both men believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), call him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the true king, and swear allegiance. Henry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lords judge the Duchess and her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) sorcerers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) is banished and ordered to do penance by being led through the streets of London before departing. Gloucester gives up his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) staff and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) office. Then, Peter and Horner enter for their combat. Peter thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) can't fight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is able to defeat and kill Horner, who arrives drunk. Later, Gloucester waits in the street to see the Duchess paraded through the streets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) warns him (<font color='blue'><b>Horner</b></font>) that the lords are out to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Horner</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Horner</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Horner</b></font>) has always been honorable and, thus, is above blame. He (<font color='blue'><b>Horner</b></font>) bids farewell to his (<font color='blue'><b>Horner</b></font>) wife. Henry holds a meeting of the lords outside London, and Somerset enters to report that all the French lands have been lost. Gloucester arrives late, and Suffolk arrests him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) for treason. The lords all accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) of wrongdoing. Henry says he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hopes Gloucester can prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) innocence, but Gloucester says the lords have all plotted against him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will not be able to defend himself. Gloucester is taken away, and Henry mourns his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) inability to defend an innocent Gloucester against the plots of the lords. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) departs; the other lords discuss how they shall come up with an excuse to kill Gloucester. A messenger arrives with news of rebellions in Ireland; York is sent to take care of them and given an army. Left alone onstage, York revels in the turn of events; all he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) had lacked was an army and now he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) has one. While he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) is in Ireland, he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) has hired Jack Cade to raise trouble in England, to say he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) is a York with a claim to the throne, to see what is the public response to such a gesture. If it's positive, York will return and take over himself. Gloucester is killed by murderers at his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) home. Henry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lords arrive for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) trial, but Suffolk announces that Gloucester has died. Henry is distraught. Warwick and Salisbury enter with reports of unsettled commoners, who suspect Gloucester was murdered. Examining the body, they decide that Gloucester died in struggle and was murdered. The commoners ask for the death or banishment of Suffolk. Henry grants their wish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) orders Suffolk to leave the country. Left alone, Margaret and Suffolk declare their feelings for each other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) will try to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) returned or will be banished, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) can't live without her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and wants to stay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) away. Meanwhile, Beaufort has been taken ill, raving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) dies miserably, signifying bad behavior during his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life. Suffolk is captured at sea but refuses to plead for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) insists he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) can't be killed by such lowly men, but Suffolk is beheaded. Cade speaks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cade</b></font>) army of commoners, claiming to be the heir to the throne and promising many changes in a new England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cade</b></font>) promises to honor only workmen, not artisans or people who can read. Stafford and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>) brother arrive with an army to convince Cade and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cade</b></font>) men to lay down their arms, but the two armies come to blows. Stafford and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stafford</b></font>) brother are killed, and Cade drags their bodies to London. Margaret holds Suffolk's disembodied head and mourns him (<font color='blue'><b>Cade</b></font>). Henry listens to reports of Cade's attack, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) determines to leave the city temporarily. Cade attacks London, hunting for and killing Lord Saye, who Cade accuses of ruining England with literacy. Cade's rabble asks Cade to create new, spoken laws. Cade wreaks havoc on London, until Buckingham and Clifford arrive, reminding the commoners of the honorable rule of Henry V. Soon, the rabble abandons Cade, who flees. Henry forgives the commoners and receives word that York's army marches from Ireland, demanding the imprisonment of Somerset, who York claims is a traitor. Meanwhile, Cade is starving in the countryside; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cade</b></font>) steals food from Alexander Iden's garden. Iden arrives, and Cade threatens him (<font color='blue'><b>Cade</b></font>). The two come to blows, and Cade is killed. York marches near London with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cade</b></font>) army. Buckingham arrives to ask about his (<font color='blue'><b>Cade</b></font>) intentions. York claims he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) only wants Somerset imprisoned. Buckingham says he (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>) has been, so York dismisses his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) army. Henry enters, followed by Margaret and Somerset. Seeing Somerset free, York can contain himself no longer; he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) accuses Henry of being a weak, unfit king, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) declares himself to be the rightful heir to the throne. Somerset orders York's arrest. York refuses to budge and asks for his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) sons Edward and Richard and Salisbury and Warwick to speak on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) behalf. Salisbury and Warwick declare their allegiance to York. Henry agrees there is nothing left to do but fight. Richard fights with Somerset and kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fights with Clifford and kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). York's army is winning, so Margaret urges Henry to flee back to London, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has support. After the battle, York declares victory, but his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) enemy has fled. So he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>), with Edward and Richard, Salisbury and Warwick, prepare to enter London.
