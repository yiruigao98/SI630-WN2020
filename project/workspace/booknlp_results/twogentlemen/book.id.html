Valentine is off to improve himself, venturing out to see the world, while Proteus stays home in Verona, tied by his (<font color='blue'><b>Proteus</b></font>) love for Julia. After Valentine departs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) servant, Speed, enters. Proteus inquires whether or not Speed delivered a letter to Julia, to which Speed replies affirmatively. Julia, meanwhile, asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) maid, Lucetta, with which man she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) should fall in love, and Lucetta recommends Proteus. Lucetta admits that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) has a letter for Julia from Proteus. After much bickering, Julia tears up the letter, only to regret this act an instant later. Antonio decides to send Proteus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Proteus</b></font>) son, to the Duke's court in Milan, a decision with which neither Proteus nor Julia is particularly happy. They exchange rings and promises to keep loving each other. Meanwhile, Valentine has fallen in love with the Duke's feisty daughter, Silvia. When Proteus arrives at court, he (<font color='blue'><b>Proteus</b></font>) too falls in love with Silvia, and vows to do anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Proteus</b></font>) can to win her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) away from Valentine. When Valentine confesses that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) and Silvia plan to elope, Proteus notifies the Duke of their plans, gaining favor for himself and effecting Valentine's banishment from court. Back in Verona, Julia has hatched a plan to disguise herself as a man so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) can journey to Milan to be reunited with Proteus. Upon arriving at court, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) witnesses Proteus and Thurio wooing Silvia. The banished Valentine, while traveling to Mantua, is apprehended by a group of outlaws. The outlaws, all of whom are banished gentlemen as well, demand Valentine to become their king. Since they threaten to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) refuses, Valentine accepts. Silvia and Julia, who is disguised as the page Sebastian, meet when Julia delivers the ring Proteus had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) to Silvia on behalf of Proteus. Julia does not reveal her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) identity. Silvia calls on her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) friend Sir Eglamour to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) father's oppressive will -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Silvia</b></font>) wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) to marry Thurio-RRB- and to find Valentine. However, while traveling through the forest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) and Eglamour are overtaken by a band of outlaws. Eglamour runs away, leaving Silvia to fend for herself against the outlaws. By this time, the Duke, Proteus, and Thurio, with Sebastian/Julia in tow, have organized a search party for Silvia. Proteus wrests Silvia away from the outlaws. Valentine watches the interaction unseen. Proteus demands that Silvia give him (<font color='blue'><b>Proteus</b></font>) some sign of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) favor for freeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) refuses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Proteus</b></font>) tries to rape her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) resistance, but Valentine jumps out and stops him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>). Proteus immediately apologizes, and Valentine offers to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) Silvia as a token of their friendship. At this moment, Sebastian faints and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) true identity becomes clear. Proteus decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Proteus</b></font>) really loves Julia better than Silvia, and takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) instead. The Duke realizes that Thurio is a thug and says that Valentine is far nobler and can marry Silvia. Valentine asks for clemency for the outlaws, and suggests that his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) marriage to Silvia and Proteus' marriage to Julia should take place on the same day.
