in Ka Ly, a town on the central coast of Vietnam. She (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) has a close relationship with
her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) parents, who teach her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) valuable lessons she (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) carries through her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) life. From her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>)
father, Trong, she (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) learns important Buddhist philosophies that help her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) make sense
of the war; from her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) mother, Huyen, she (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) learns the love and bonds of family. Villagers of Ka Ly fight for both sides of the war. Le Ly's own brothers are
split between North and South, and many families change sides during the war. By
day, the village is under the rule of the Republicans, and at night, under that of
the Viet Cong. At first, the Viet Cong's motives for war correspond more closely to
the villagers own beliefs and values then those of the South, and consequently, the
villagers, including Le Ly, help the Viet Cong. However, Le Ly soon learns the
severity of the Viet Cong when she (<font color='blue'><b>villagers</b></font>) is raped and exiled from the village. Her (<font color='blue'><b>villagers</b></font>) mother
joins her (<font color='blue'><b>villagers</b></font>), and they leave to find work in Saigon, while her (<font color='blue'><b>villagers</b></font>) father remains there to
tend to the land of their ancestors. The bustling city of Saigon is overwhelming and intimidating to Le Ly and her (<font color='blue'><b>villagers</b></font>)
mother. They eventually find employment from a wealthy businessman, Anh, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Anh</b></font>)
family. Le Ly is a governess to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>) children and a personal maid to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>) sickly wife;
Huyen is a second housekeeper. Le Ly falls in love with Anh and soon becomes
pregnant with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>) child. When she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) discovers her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) pregnancy, Le Ly and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) mother are
thrown out of the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) returns to Danang, homeless, unemployed, and pregnant.
The pregnancy is hard for Le Ly because she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) lives with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) sister Lan and Lan's
abusive American boyfriends. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>) hears about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>) daughter's unwed pregnancy,
Trong disowns her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), but after her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) son Huang's birth, Trong forgives his (<font color='blue'><b>Huang</b></font>) beloved
daughter. After the birth of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) son, Le Ly supports her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) family by selling souvenirs
on the black market. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) also secretly visits and cares for her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) father, who remains
in the village. In spite of Le Ly's diligent care, Trong becomes inconsolably
disillusioned with the war. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>) also grows depressed because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>) is separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>)
family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>) commits suicide by drinking acid. Through her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) positive dealings with Americans--her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) relationship with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) first
husband, Ed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) subsequent boyfriends--and negative experience with the Viet
Cong, Le Ly's opinion of <div class="bookquote">``the enemy''  (<font color='red'><b>Le Ly</b></font>)</div>changes. After her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) father's death, Le Ly is no
longer confused about where her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) loyalty should lie. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) decides that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) will leave
Vietnam as soon as possible. Over the next few years, Le Ly works at a hospital and
at GI bars. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) has many American boyfriends: Red, a nerdy Navy medic who changes
her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) appearance; Jimmy, a Chinese-American civilian contractor becomes a violent
drunk; Paul, a U.S. Air Force officer; and Ed Monroe, an elderly civilian
contractor. Ed, lonely for companionship, asks Le Ly to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>). Taken with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>)
kindness and the opportunity to leave Vietnam for the United States, Le Ly accepts.
After months of preparation and the birth of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) second son, Le Ly leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
homeland, unsure if she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) will ever return. In the 1980s, the Communist Party of Vietnam starts to allow Viet
Ku--Vietnamese expatriates--to return to the country. Le Ly is anxious about returning
and wary of how her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) family will receive her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) arrives in Saigon, Anh greets
her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) warmly. Together they travel to Danang for the reunion with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) family. Le Ly
realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) has returned to a country controlled by fear, more so than when
she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) left. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) also realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) may be putting her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) family in danger by
returning. Le Ly is most anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) reunion with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) eldest brother, Bon Ngh, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) mother. Bon Ngh left for Hanoi when Le Ly was only five, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>) is like a
stranger to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ly</b></font>) is very suspicious of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) motivations for returning and suspects
that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) is a spy. Over the next few days of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) visit, Le Ly slowly convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
brother that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) has returned only to see her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) family and that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) is eager to mend
the wounds of the war. Huyen is also cold toward Le Ly at first but gradually warms
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>). During their time together, Huyen shares many stories with Le Ly and
gladly accepts all of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) gifts. Le Ly speaks to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) brother about setting up a medical center and improving
the relationship between the government and the Viet Ku and the rest of the world.
She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) exposes her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) family to the important lessons that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) learned. From her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) teaching,
Huyen mends the strained relationship with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) daughter and reunites the whole
family. After a tearful goodbye to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) mother and sisters, Le Ly leaves Danang with
a renewed desire to help her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) country. On the flight back to Saigon, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) catches a
glimmer of Ka Ly out the window.
