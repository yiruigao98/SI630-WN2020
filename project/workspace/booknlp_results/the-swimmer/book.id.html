They are all drinking. Neddy feels young, energetic, and happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) decides to get home by swimming across all the pools in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) county. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) feels like an explorer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) dives into the Westerhazys' pool, swims across, and gets out on the other side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) thinks about all the pools that lie ahead and the friends that await him (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) walks to the Grahams' pool, swims across, then has a drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) next swims across the Hammers' pool, then several others. At the Bunkers' pool, a party is going on. Enid Bunker greets him (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>), telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>)'s happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) could come to the party after all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) has a drink, then moves on. The Levys aren't home, but Neddy swims across their pool anyway and helps himself to a drink, feeling very contented. A storm begins, and Neddy waits it out in the Levys' gazebo. After the storm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) notices that red and yellow leaves are scattered all over the lawn. Neddy heads toward the Welchers' pool. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) finds that the Lindleys' horse-riding area is overgrown, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) can't remember whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) heard that the Lindleys were going away for the summer. At the Welchers' house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) finds that the pool is empty, which Neddy thinks is strange. There is a for-sale sign in front of their house. Neddy tries to remember when he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) last heard from the Welchers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) wonders whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) memory is failing him (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) or he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) has just repressed unpleasant information. Neddy waits for a long time to cross a highway, and people in the cars going by yell and throw things at him (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) should head back to the Westerhazys', but he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) can't bring himself to do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) finally manages to cross to the median and then to the other side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) walks to a public pool, showers, and swims across, disgusted by the crowds and the overly chlorinated water. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) walks to the Hallorans'. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) takes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) swim trunks because he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) knows the Hallorans enjoy being naked and swims across the pool. The Hallorans greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) and say that they're sorry for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``misfortunes,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>hinting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>)'s sold his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) house and something has happened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) family. Neddy denies that anything has happened, puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) swim trunks back on, and leaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) feels cold and weak and smells burning wood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) could have a drink of whiskey so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) could warm up and get some energy. Neddy asks for a drink when he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) gets to Helen and Eric Sachses' pool, but Helen says they haven't been drinking since Eric had an operation three years ago. Neddy has no recollection that Eric had been sick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) swims across their pool, then tells them he (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) hopes to see them again soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) goes to the Biswangers' house. The Biswangers regularly invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) and Lucinda to dinner, but they always refuse because the Biswangers are of a lower social standing. A party is going on, and Neddy goes to the bar. Grace Biswanger greets him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) coldly, and the bartender is rude to him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>). Neddy knows that their odd behavior means something has happened to his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) own social standing because caterers and bartenders always know what's happening in his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) social circle. In the background, Grace says something about someone losing all their money and asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) for a loan. Neddy swims across the pool, then leaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) expects to get a warm welcome at Shirley Adams's pool because Shirley had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) mistress, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) can't remember how long ago the affair had ended. Shirley tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) won't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) any more money and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) won't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) a drink because someone is in the house. Neddy swims across the pool, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) has trouble getting out and must use the ladder. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) walks away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) smells fall flowers and sees fall constellations in the sky. Neddy starts crying for the first time since childhood, feeling cold and confused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) thinks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) has just been swimming too long and needs a drink and dry clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) swims weakly across a few more pools. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) reaches his (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) own house. The lights are all off, and Neddy doesn't know where everyone could be. Every door is locked, and no one answers when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) knocks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) looks in the windows and sees that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) house is empty.
