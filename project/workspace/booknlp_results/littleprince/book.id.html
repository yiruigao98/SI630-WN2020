in the Sahara desert. The crash badly damages his (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) airplane and leaves
the narrator with very little food or water. As he (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) is worrying over
his (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) predicament, he (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) is approached by the little prince, a very serious
little blond boy who asks the narrator to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) a sheep. The
narrator obliges, and the two become friends. The pilot learns that
the little prince comes from a small planet that the little prince
calls Asteroid325 but that people on Earth
call Asteroid B-612. The little prince took
great care of this planet, preventing any bad seeds from growing
and making sure it was never overrun by baobab trees. One day, a
mysterious rose sprouted on the planet and the little prince fell
in love with it. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) caught the rose in a lie one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)
decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) could not trust her (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) anymore. He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) grew lonely and
decided to leave. Despite a last-minute reconciliation with the
rose, the prince set out to explore other planets and cure his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) loneliness. While journeying, the narrator tells us, the little prince
passes by neighboring asteroids and encounters for the first time
the strange, narrow-minded world of grown-ups. On the first six
planets the little prince visits, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) meets a king, a vain man, a
drunkard, a businessman, a lamplighter, and a geographer, all of
whom live alone and are overly consumed by their chosen occupations.
Such strange behavior both amuses and perturbs the little prince.
He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) does not understand their need to order people around, to be
admired, and to own everything. With the exception of the lamplighter,
whose dogged faithfulness he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) admires, the little prince does not
think much of the adults he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) visits, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) does not learn anything
useful. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) learns from the geographer that flowers do not
last forever, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) begins to miss the rose he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) has left behind. At the geographer's suggestion, the little prince visits
Earth, but he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) lands in the middle of the desert and cannot find
any humans. Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) meets a snake who speaks in riddles and
hints darkly that its lethal poison can send the little prince back
to the heavens if he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) so wishes. The little prince ignores the offer
and continues his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) explorations, stopping to talk to a three-petaled
flower and to climb the tallest mountain he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) can find, where he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) confuses
the echo of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) voice for conversation. Eventually, the little prince
finds a rose garden, which surprises and depresses him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) rose
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was the only one of her (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) kind. The prince befriends a fox, who teaches him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) that the important things
in life are visible only to the heart, that his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) time away from the rose
makes the rose more special to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>), and that love makes a person
responsible for the beings that one loves. The little prince realizes
that, even though there are many roses, his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) love for his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) rose makes
her (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) unique and that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) is therefore responsible for her (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>). Despite
this revelation, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) still feels very lonely because he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) is so far away
from his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) rose. The prince ends his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) story by describing his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) encounters
with two men, a railway switchman and a salesclerk. It is now the narrator's eighth day in the desert, and
at the prince's suggestion, they set off to find a well. The water
feeds their hearts as much as their bodies, and the two share a
moment of bliss as they agree that too many people do not see what
is truly important in life. The little prince's mind, however, is
fixed on returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) rose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) begins making plans with
the snake to head back to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) planet. The narrator is able to fix
his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) plane on the day before the one-year anniversary of the prince's
arrival on Earth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) walks sadly with his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) friend out to the
place the prince landed. The snake bites the prince, who falls noiselessly
to the sand. The narrator takes comfort when he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) cannot find the prince's body
the next day and is confident that the prince has returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) asteroid.
The narrator is also comforted by the stars, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) now hears
the tinkling of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) friend's laughter. Often, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) grows
sad and wonders if the sheep he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) drew has eaten the prince's rose.
The narrator concludes by showing his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) readers a drawing of the desert
landscape and by asking us to stop for a while under the stars if
we are ever in the area and to let the narrator know immediately
if the little prince has returned.
