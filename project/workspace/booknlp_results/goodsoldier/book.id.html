(<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) story, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) explains will be about the nine-year acquaintance that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) wife Florence had with another couple, Edward and Leonora Ashburnham. Because this novel is comprised of Dowell's thoughts as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dowell</b></font>) writes them, the plot is not chronological; it shifts back and forth between past events and Dowell's current reflections on those events. Overall, the novel is divided into four parts. In Part I of The Good Soldier, Dowell explains the background of the four protagonists. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dowell</b></font>) and Florence are Americans, from Philadelphia and Stamford, Connecticut, respectively. Edward and Leonora are British, the former a Catholic from Ireland, and the latter an Anglican from a respected family in Fordingbridge. Dowell sees similarities between the two couples. Both Dowell's wife, Florence, and Edward Ashburnham are <div class="bookquote">``heart patients.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Ashburnham</b></font>)</div>The couples meet in Nauheim, a health spa, in August 1904 where both <div class="bookquote">``invalids''  (<font color='red'><b>The couples</b></font>)</div>come to improve their health. The four strike up a friendship. Dowell describes Edward as perfectly honest and upright, someone with whom you could trust your wife. Dowell goes on to narrate in detail an excursion that the two couples took to a town which houses Martin Luther's protest. In the bedroom, while Florence is discussing the Protest, Leonora realizes Florence and Edward will have an affair. Dowell is blind to this implication. In this part of the novel, Dowell compares their friendship to a minuet, and to <div class="bookquote">``an extraordinarily safe castle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dowell</b></font>)</div>but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dowell</b></font>) bemoans the end of permanence and stability now that their friendship, nine years later, is over. Edward has been having numerous affairs: with a woman in the back of a railway car, with the mistress of a Grand Duke in Monte Carlo, with a woman married to an army officer in India, and with a young, submissive woman the Ashburnhams have brought with them from India to Nauheim. After the affair with La Dolciquita, Edward brought the Ashburnhams into deep debt, and Leonora took complete control of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) money and land. The Ashburnhams have been in India eight years to save money, and now that they are in Nauheim, Leonora feels she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) has regained control of their lives. On the day that they meet the Dowells, Leonora sees Maisie Maidan coming out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) husband's bedroom and she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) assumes they are having an affair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) boxes Mrs. Maidan's ears, and Florence sees this act of violence. Leonora, who cares deeply about propriety, attempts to befriend Florence to cover up what has been witnessed; that is how the two couples become friends. Part I ends with Mrs. Maidan's death. Now that Florence has started an affair with Edward, Mrs. Maidan overhears them talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maidan</b></font>), and finds out that Leonora has brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) along so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) may be a <div class="bookquote">``safe''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>mistress for Edward. Mrs. Maidan is appalled and dies; unlike Florence and Edward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maidan</b></font>) suffers from a real heart condition. Leonora lives with the guilt over this death. In Part II, Dowell explains Florence's real desire to be the lady of Fordingbridge, in the town in England where her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) ancestors were forced to live centuries ago. Edward Ashburnham's estate, Branshaw Manor, is in Fordingbridge. The chapter flashes back to Dowell and Florence's first meeting in Connecticut. They were married against the wishes of Florence's aunts, the Misses Hurlbird, and immediately left for Europe. On the boat trip to Europe, Florence feigned a heart condition, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) pretend heart condition keeps them forever trapped on the European continent. While Dowell and Florence lived in Paris, Florence has an affair with a low-class artist named Jimmy, but Dowell knows nothing about it. Dowell's own marriage to Florence has remained unconsummated for thirteen years. After Florence's nine-year affair with Edward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) plans to divorce Dowell and marry Edward. But one night, August 4, 1913, Florence sees Edward in the park alone at night with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) young ward, Nancy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) grows insanely jealous and runs back to the hotel, only to find an old acquaintance, Mr. Bagshawe, telling Dowell about Florence's indecent relationship with Jimmy many years ago. Part II ends with the discovery of Florence's dead body; she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) has poisoned herself. Part III opens with Dowell considering marriage to Nancy, the Ashburnhams'' young ward. But Edward, too, is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>). Nancy, who has recently left convent school, admires her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) uncle immensely for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heroic deeds and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) assumes he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and Leonora have a healthy marriage; she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) is not in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in the same way. After Florence's death, Leonora, Edward, and Nancy all return to Branshaw Manor in England. There, Leonora has a nervous breakdown, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) surmises that Edward is in love with Nancy. In this section, Dowell narrates the entire history of Edward and Leonora's marriage. Through all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dowell</b></font>) affairs, Leonora always hoped that Edward would return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) and love her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) again. But when Edward began his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affair with Florence, Leonora's love died. In Part IV, Leonora realizes that Nancy is safe from Edward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) sees that the small amount of sexual morality that her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) husband possesses will keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) from starting an affair with Nancy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) has a breakdown and tells Nancy what a terrible husband Edward is. Nancy's ideals are crushed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) eyes are opened to the realities of the world. Dowell says that together, Leonora and Nancy begin to slowly torture of Edward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) suffers greatly and plans for Nancy to travel to India to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) sends a telegram from India saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) is having a good time. Edward is crushed; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) desires is to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) worship him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) from afar. Edward commits suicide by stabbing himself with a penknife. Leonora remarries a <div class="bookquote">``perfectly normal''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonora</b></font>)</div>man named Rodney Bayham and they have a child. Nancy goes mad; the only word she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) can say is <div class="bookquote">``shuttlecock.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Dowell buys Branshaw Manor and becomes Nancy's permanent caretaker.
