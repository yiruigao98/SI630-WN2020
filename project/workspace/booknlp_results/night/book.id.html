Jewish teenager who, when the memoir begins, lives in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) hometown
of Sighet, in Hungarian Transylvania. Eliezer studies the Torah
-LRB-the first five books of the Old Testament-RRB- and the Cabbala -LRB-a doctrine
of Jewish mysticism-RRB-. His (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) instruction is cut short, however, when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) teacher, Moishe the Beadle, is deported. In a few months, Moishe
returns, telling a horrifying tale: the Gestapo -LRB-the German secret
police force-RRB- took charge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) train, led everyone into the woods,
and systematically butchered them. Nobody believes Moishe, who is
taken for a lunatic. In the spring of 1944, the Nazis
occupy Hungary. Not long afterward, a series of increasingly repressive
measures are passed, and the Jews of Eliezer's town are forced into
small ghettos within Sighet. Soon they are herded onto cattle cars,
and a nightmarish journey ensues. After days and nights crammed
into the car, exhausted and near starvation, the passengers arrive
at Birkenau, the gateway to Auschwitz. Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) arrival in Birkenau, Eliezer and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) father are
separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) mother and sisters, whom they never see again.
In the first of many <div class="bookquote">``selections''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliezer</b></font>)</div>that Eliezer describes in the
memoir, the Jews are evaluated to determine whether they should
be killed immediately or put to work. Eliezer and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) father seem
to pass the evaluation, but before they are brought to the prisoners'
barracks, they stumble upon the open-pit furnaces where the Nazis
are burning babies by the truckload. The Jewish arrivals are stripped, shaved, disinfected,
and treated with almost unimaginable cruelty. Eventually, their
captors march them from Birkenau to the main camp, Auschwitz. They
eventually arrive in Buna, a work camp, where Eliezer is put to
work in an electrical-fittings factory. Under slave-labor conditions,
severely malnourished and decimated by the frequent <div class="bookquote">``selections,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jews</b></font>)</div>the Jews take solace in caring for each other, in religion, and
in Zionism, a movement favoring the establishment of a Jewish state
in Palestine, considered the holy land. In the camp, the Jews are
subject to beatings and repeated humiliations. A vicious foreman
forces Eliezer to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) gold tooth, which is pried out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) mouth with a rusty spoon. The prisoners are forced to watch the hanging of fellow
prisoners in the camp courtyard. On one occasion, the Gestapo even
hang a small child who had been associated with some rebels within
Buna. Because of the horrific conditions in the camps and the ever-present danger
of death, many of the prisoners themselves begin to slide into cruelty,
concerned only with personal survival. Sons begin to abandon and
abuse their fathers. Eliezer himself begins to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) humanity
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) faith, both in God and in the people around him (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>). After months in the camp, Eliezer undergoes an operation
for a foot injury. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) is in the infirmary, however, the Nazis
decide to evacuate the camp because the Russians are advancing and
are on the verge of liberating Buna. In the middle of a snowstorm,
the prisoners begin a death march: they are forced to run for more
than fifty miles to the Gleiwitz concentration camp. Many die of
exposure to the harsh weather and exhaustion. At Gleiwitz, the prisoners
are herded into cattle cars once again. They begin another deadly
journey: one hundred Jews board the car, but only twelve remain
alive when the train reaches the concentration camp Buchenwald. Throughout
the ordeal, Eliezer and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliezer</b></font>) father help each other to survive by
means of mutual support and concern. In Buchenwald, however, Eliezer's
father dies of dysentery and physical abuse. Eliezer survives, an
empty shell of a man until April 11, 1945,
the day that the American army liberates the camp.
