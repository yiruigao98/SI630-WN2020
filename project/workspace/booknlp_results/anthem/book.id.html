who has found a hidden tunnel and hides in it to write, knows his (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>)
solitude violates all the laws of his (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>) society. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>) does
not feel guilt for his (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>) actions, he (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>) begs the forgiveness of the ruling
Council. As he (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>) spends more time alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>) realizes that solitude
suits him (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>) begins to crave more and more time by himself.
From his (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>) tunnel, Equality 7-2521 records
episodes from his (<font color='blue'><b>youth</b></font>) childhood. As a child, Equality 7-2521 wanted
more than anything to be a scholar. He (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was cursed with
a terrific curiosity, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) prefer some things to others
and to prefer some people to others. He (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) often fought with the boys
at the Home of Students, and he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was reprimanded by his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) teachers
for being too smart and too tall. He (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) tried to conform to the standard
the others set, but no matter how hard he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) tried, he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was smarter
and quicker than they were. When the Council of Vocations assigned
him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) to be a street sweeper instead of a scholar, he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was pleased
because it meant he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) could atone for the sins he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) had committed. When he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was ten, Equality 7-2521 saw
the public execution of the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word,
who had discovered the word <div class="bookquote">``I''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and was burned to death in the town
square as punishment for using the word. While he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was burning, the
Transgressor showed no pain but locked eyes with Equality 7-2521.
Equality 7-2521 comes to believe that that
moment anointed him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) as a disciple of the same crusade as the Transgressor. Equality 7-2521 begins to conduct
experiments and shortly discovers electricity. After many weeks
of work, he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) successfully builds a lightbulb from the materials he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>)
finds in his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) tunnel. He (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) must share his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) invention
with the world and resolves to present it to the World Council of
Scholars when it convenes that year in his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) city. In the meantime, Equality 7-2521 has
met the Golden One, a beautiful peasant girl who is proud and haughty.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) knows it is wrong to do so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) speaks to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) gets
the chance, and they immediately fall in love. One day, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) offers
him (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) some water from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) drinks it, not understanding
why this act makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) think of the Palace of Mating, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) and
all other mature citizens are sent once a year to have sex. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) can show the lightbulb to the World Council,
Equality 7-2521 accidentally returns late
to the Home of the Street Sweepers, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) lives. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) refuses
to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) Home Council where he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) has been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) is thrown into the
Palace of Corrective Detention. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) is tortured, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) still
refuses to tell where he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) has been, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) wants to keep the
lightbulb a secret until he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) gets to show it to the World Council.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) remains incarcerated until the World Council convenes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>)
breaks out of the Palace of Corrective Detention and goes to the
World Council, expecting to be exonerated and reconciled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>)
brothers. When Equality 7-2521 arrives and
tells the World Council his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) story, however, the World Council rejects
him (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) out of fear and anger. It threatens to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) and to get rid
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) lightbulb. He (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) cannot abide having his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) lightbulb destroyed,
so he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) grabs his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) invention and flees the city. He (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) runs to the Uncharted
Forest where he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) discovers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) is free at last to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) pleases. A few days later, the Golden One appears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) has followed Equality 7-2521 into
the woods. They vow to live together in peace and solitude. After
they have been hiking for several days in the mountains, they find
an abandoned house from the Unmentionable Times. The Golden One
revels in the finery she (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) finds in the house, and Equality 7-2521 consumes
the library. He (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) discovers the meaning of the word <div class="bookquote">``I,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) vows
to protect his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) home and from there launch a new race of men who
will believe in individualism and the never-ending supremacy of
the ego.
