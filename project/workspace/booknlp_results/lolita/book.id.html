Ph.D., explains the strange story that will follow. According to
Ray, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) received the manuscript, entitled Lolita, or the
Confession of a White Widowed Male, from the author's lawyer.
The author himself, known by the pseudonym of Humbert Humbert -LRB-or
H. H.-RRB-, died in jail of coronary thrombosis while awaiting a trial.
Ray asserts that while the author's actions are despicable, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>)
writing remains beautiful and persuasive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) also indicates that
the novel will become a favorite in psychiatric circles as well
as encourage parents to raise better children in a better world. In the manuscript, Humbert relates his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) peaceful upbringing
on the Riviera, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) encounters his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) first love, the twelve-year-old Annabel
Leigh. Annabel and the thirteen-year-old Humbert never consummate
their love, and Annabel's death from typhus four months later haunts
Humbert. Although Humbert goes on to a career as a teacher of English
literature, he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) spends time in a mental institution and works a succession
of odd jobs. Despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) marriage to an adult woman, which eventually
fails, Humbert remains obsessed with sexually desirable and sexually
aware young girls. These nymphets, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) calls them, remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>)
of Annabel, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) fails to find another like her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabel</b></font>). Eventually,
Humbert comes to the United States and takes a room in the house
of widow Charlotte Haze in a sleepy, suburban New England town.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) becomes instantly infatuated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Haze</b></font>) twelve-year-old daughter
Dolores, also known as Lolita. Humbert follows Lolita's moves constantly,
occasionally flirts with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>), and confides his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) pedophiliac longings
to a journal. Meanwhile, Charlotte Haze, whom Humbert loathes, has fallen
in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>). When Charlotte sends Lolita off to summer camp,
Humbert marries Charlotte in order to stay near his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) true love. Humbert
wants to be alone with Lolita and even toys with the idea of killing
Charlotte, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) can't go through with it. However, Charlotte finds
his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) diary and, after learning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) hates her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) but loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) daughter,
confronts him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>). Humbert denies everything, but Charlotte tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) and storms out of the house. At that moment,
a car hits her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dies instantly. Humbert goes to the summer camp and picks up Lolita. Only when
they arrive at a motel does he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) that Charlotte has died. In
his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) account of events, Humbert claims that Lolita seduces him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>), rather
than the other way around. The two drive across the country for
nearly a year, during which time Humbert becomes increasingly obsessed
with Lolita and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) learns to manipulate him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) engages in
tantrums or refuses his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) advances, Humbert threatens to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) in
an orphanage. At the same time, a strange man seems to take an interest
in Humbert and Lolita and appears to be following them in their
travels. Humbert eventually gets a job at Beardsley College somewhere in
the Northeast, and Lolita enrolls in school. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) wish to socialize with
boys her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) own age causes a strain in their relationship, and Humbert
becomes more restrictive in his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) rules. Nonetheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) allows her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>)
to appear in a school play. Lolita begins to behave secretively
around Humbert, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) of being unfaithful and takes
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) away on another road trip. On the road, Humbert suspects that
they are being followed. Lolita doesn't notice anything, and Humbert
accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) of conspiring with their stalker. Lolita becomes ill, and Humbert must take her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) to the hospital. However,
when Humbert returns to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>), the nurses tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) uncle
has already picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) up. Humbert flies into a rage, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>)
calms himself and leaves the hospital, heartbroken and angry. For the next two years, Humbert searches for Lolita, unearthing clues
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) kidnapper in order to exact his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) revenge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) halfheartedly
takes up with a woman named Rita, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) receives a note from
Lolita, now married and pregnant, asking for money. Assuming that
Lolita has married the man who had followed them on their travels,
Humbert becomes determined to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) finds Lolita, poor and
pregnant at seventeen. Humbert realizes that Lolita's husband is
not the man who kidnapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) from the hospital. When pressed, Lolita
admits that Clare Quilty, a playwright whose presence has been felt
from the beginning of the book, had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) from the hospital.
Lolita loved Quilty, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) kicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) out when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) refused to participate
in a child pornography orgy. Still devoted to Lolita, Humbert begs
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) to return to him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>). Lolita gently refuses. Humbert gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Lolita</b></font>) 4,000
dollars and then departs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) tracks down Quilty at his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) house and
shoots him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) multiple times, killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>). Humbert is arrested and
put in jail, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) continues to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbert</b></font>) memoir, stipulating
that it can only be published upon Lolita's death. After Lolita
dies in childbirth, Humbert dies of heart failure, and the manuscript
is sent to John Ray, Jr., Ph.D..
