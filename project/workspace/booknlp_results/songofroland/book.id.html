The last city standing is Saragossa, held by the Muslim king Marsilla. Terrified of the might of Charlemagne's army of Franks, Marsilla sends out messengers to Charlemagne, promising treasure and Marsilla's conversion to Christianity if the Franks will go back to France. Charlemagne and his (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) men are tired of fighting and decide to accept this peace offer. They need now to select a messenger to go back to Marsilla's court. The bold warrior Roland nominates his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) stepfather Ganelon. Ganelon is enraged; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) fears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>)'ll die in the hands of the bloodthirsty pagans and suspects that this is just Roland's intent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) has long hated and envied his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) stepson, and, riding back to Saragossa with the Saracen messengers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) finds an opportunity for revenge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) tells the Saracens how they could ambush the rear guard of Charlemagne's army, which will surely be led by Roland as the Franks pick their way back to Spain through the mountain passes, and helps the Saracens plan their attack. Just as the traitor Ganelon predicted, Roland gallantly volunteers to lead the rear guard. The wise and moderate Olivier and the fierce archbishop Turpin are among the men Roland picks to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>). Pagans ambush them at Roncesvals, according to plan; the Christians are overwhelmed by their sheer numbers. Seeing how badly outnumbered they are, Olivier asks Roland to blow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) oliphant, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) horn made out of an elephant tusk, to call for help from the main body of the Frankish army. Roland proudly refuses to do so, claiming that they need no help, that the rear guard can easily take on the pagan hordes. While the Franks fight magnificently, there's no way they can continue to hold off against the Saracens, and the battle begins to turn clearly against them. Almost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) men are dead and Roland knows that it's now too late for Charlemagne and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) troops to save them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) blows his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) oliphant anyway, so that the emperor can see what happened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) men and avenge them. Roland blows so hard that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) temples burst. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) dies a glorious martyr's death, and saints take his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) soul straight to Paradise. When Charlemagne and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) men reach the battlefield, they find only dead bodies. The pagans have fled, but the Franks pursue them, chasing them into the river Ebro, where they all drown. Meanwhile, the powerful emir of Babylon, Baligant, has arrived in Spain to help his (<font color='blue'><b>emir</b></font>) vassal Marsilla fend off the Frankish threat. Baligant and his (<font color='blue'><b>emir</b></font>) enormous Muslim army ride after Charlemagne and his (<font color='blue'><b>emir</b></font>) Christian army, meeting them on the battlefield at Roncesvals, where the Christians are burying and mourning their dead. Both sides fight valiantly. But when Charlemagne kills Baligant, all the pagan army scatter and flee. Now Saragossa has no defenders left; the Franks take the city. With Marsilla's wife Bramimonde, Charlemagne and his (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) men ride back to Aix, their capital in sweet France. The Franks discovered Ganelon's betrayal some time ago and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) in chains until it is time for his (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) trial. Ganelon argues that his (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) action was legitimate revenge, openly proclaimed, not treason. While the council of barons, which Charlemagne gathered to decide the traitor's fate is initially swayed by this claim, one man, Thierry, argues that, because Roland was serving Charlemagne when Ganelon delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) revenge on him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>), Ganelon's action constitutes a betrayal of the emperor. Ganelon's friend Pinabel challenges Thierry to trial by combat; the two will fight a duel to see who's right. By divine intervention, Thierry, the weaker man, wins, killing Pinabel. The Franks are convinced by this of Ganelon's villainy and sentence him (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) to a most painful death. The traitor is torn limb from limb by galloping horses and thirty of his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) relatives are hung for good measure.
