War II, via a Veteran's Hospital, Tayo must find a way to cure himself
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Veteran</b></font>) mental anguish, and to bring the rain back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Veteran</b></font>) community. Combining
prose and poetry, Ceremony interweaves the individual story
of Tayo and the collective story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Veteran</b></font>) people. As Tayo's journey
unfolds, it is paralleled by poems telling old stories. The trauma of thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Veteran</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Veteran</b></font>) uncle Josiah's face
among a crowd of Japanese soldiers he (<font color='blue'><b>Veteran</b></font>) was ordered to shoot, and
then of watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Veteran</b></font>) cousin Rocky die, drove Tayo out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) mind.
A period of time in a Veterans' Hospital gets him (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) well enough to
return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) home, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) Grandmother, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) Auntie, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Auntie</b></font>) husband
Robert. This is the family unit that raised him (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) mother,
who had conceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) with an unknown white man, left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for good
at the age of four. In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family's home Tayo faces not only their
disappointment at the loss of Rocky, but also his (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) continued grieving
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) favorite uncle Josiah's death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) also contends with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>)
guilt over a prayer against the rain he (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) uttered in the forests of
the Philippines, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) thinks is responsible for the six-year
drought on the reservation. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) slowly recuperates, Tayo realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) is not
alone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) childhood friends Harley, Leroy, Emo, and Pinkie who
also fought in the war contend with similar post-traumatic stress,
self-medicating with alcohol. The company is little comfort. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>)
old friends spend their drunken hours reminiscing about how great
the war was and how much respect they got while they were in uniform.
These stories only make Tayo think about the tremendous discrimination the
Native Americans face at the hands of the whites, whom they nonetheless
seem to admire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) is even more saddened and infuriated. Just
as Tayo begins to give up hope and to wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) could return to the
VA hospital, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) grandmother calls in the medicine man, Ku'oosh.
Ku'oosh performs for Tayo a ceremony for warriors who have killed
in battle, but both Ku'oosh and Tayo fear that the ancient ceremonies
are not applicable to this new situation. Tayo is helped but not cured by Ku'oosh's ceremony. It
prompts him (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) to consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) childhood, especially the summer before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) left for the army. Although Auntie did her (<font color='blue'><b>Auntie</b></font>) best to keep the two
boys separate, Tayo and Rocky became close friends, and the summer
after they graduated from high school, they enlisted in the army
together. That summer, Josiah fell in love with Night Swan, a Mexican woman
who lived just outside the reservation. At her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) urging, he (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) invested
in a herd of Mexican cattle, which Tayo helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) to care for.
As so often happens, there is a drought that summer. Having heard
the old stories of how droughts are ended, Tayo goes to a spring
and invents a rain ceremony. The following day it rains. In addition
to helping the crops and the cattle, the rain keeps Josiah from
visiting Night Swan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) asks Tayo to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a note. Tayo delivers
the note, and in the process is seduced by Night Swan. Realizing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) ceremony has not been enough for Tayo, Ku'oosh
sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) to the nearby town of Gallup to see another medicine man,
Betonie, who knows more about the problems incurred by the contact
between Native American and white cultures. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is skeptical
of Betonie's strange ways and especially high connection with the
white world, Tayo tells him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what is troubling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Betonie
listens and explains that they must invent and complete a new ceremony.
Tayo accepts. Betonie tells Tayo stores of the old ceremonies as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) performs them. Then Betonie tells Tayo stories of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandfather,
Descheeny, and the beginning of the creation of a new ceremony to
stop the destruction the whites, an invention of Native American
witchery, are wreaking on the world. Betonie sends Tayo back home, reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the ceremony
is still far from complete. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meets Harley and Leroy on the
way home, Tayo slips back into their lifestyle for a moment, but soon
moves on, heeding the signs Betonie told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) searches for
Josiah's cattle. Tayo follows the stars to a woman's house. After spending
a night with the woman, Ts`eh, Tayo heads up into the mountains.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds Josiah's cattle fenced into a white man's pasture. While
Tayo breaks into the pasture, the cattle run off to its far reaches,
and Tayo spends all night looking for them. As dawn approaches,
Tayo is about to give up when a mountain lion comes up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Tayo
honors the mountain lion, and follows its tracks to the cattle.
Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) herds the cattle out of the pasture, two white patrolmen
find Tayo. Not realizing that the cattle are missing, but knowing
Tayo has trespassed, the patrolmen arrest Tayo. Before they can
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to town, however, they notice the mountain lion tracks
and let Tayo go in order to hunt it. As Tayo heads out, it begins
to snow. Tayo knows this will cover the tracks of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cattle and
of the mountain lion, making the patrolmens' efforts fruitless. On
the way down the mountain, Tayo meets a hunter, who lives with Ts`eh.
When they arrive back at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has corralled Tayo's cattle,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keeps until Tayo and Robert return with a cattle truck
to gather them up. Returning home with Josiah's cattle, Tayo feels cured.
However, the drought persists, and Tayo knows the ceremony is not
complete. He (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) goes to the family's ranch with the cattle, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>)
finds Ts`eh . They spend the summer together, but as it draws to
an end Robert visits and warns Tayo that Emo has been spreading
rumors about him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). Shortly thereafter, Ts`eh tells Tayo that Emo
and the white police are coming after him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). Before she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) leaves, she (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>)
tells Tayo how to avoid capture. Following Ts`eh's instructions, Tayo easily evades the
white police. Still running from Emo, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) meets Harley and Leroy.
Almost too late, Tayo realizes that Harley and Leroy have joined
forces with Emo. Running again, Tayo finds himself in an abandoned
uranium mine. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harley</b></font>) looks at the gaping hole left in the earth,
Tayo realizes that this is the last station of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harley</b></font>) ceremony, the
one where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harley</b></font>) incorporates an element of white culture, the mine.
All he (<font color='blue'><b>Harley</b></font>) has to do is to spend the night there and the ceremony will
be complete. Soon Emo and Pinkie arrive. From a hiding place, Tayo
must watch them torture Harley to death, and restrain himself from
killing Emo in order to save Harley. With the help of the wind,
Tayo survives the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harley</b></font>) returns home and goes back to Ku'oosh.
After hearing all about Tayo's ceremony, Ku'oosh pronounces that
Ts`eh was in fact A'moo`ooh, who has given her (<font color='blue'><b>Tayo</b></font>) blessings to Tayo
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harley</b></font>) ceremony; the drought is ended and the destruction of the
whites is stopped. Tayo spends one last night in Ku'oosh's house
to finish off the ceremony, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harley</b></font>) returns home.
