We learn that the cherry trees are in bloom even though it is frosty outside. Yermolay Lopakhin, a friend of the family, and Dunyasha a maid on the Ranevsky estate, wait for the estate's owner Ranevsky at the estate's main house, in a room called <div class="bookquote">``the nursery'' (<font color='red'><b>Ranevsky</b></font>)</div>. Lopakhin reveals that Ranevsky has been in Paris for the last five years. Lopakhin is a local businessman in his (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>) mid- thirties, dressed in a fine white suit -LRB-with gaudy yellow shoes-RRB-, whose feelings towards Ranevsky are mixed between affectionate gratitude for past kindnesses, and resentment at her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) condescension toward him (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>) because of his (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>) humble, peasant origins. Also on the estate is Simon Yephikodov, a hapless youth nicknamed <div class="bookquote">``Simple Simon''  (<font color='red'><b>a youth</b></font>)</div>because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) frequent and ridiculous accidents. Soon, Ranevsky arrives from Paris, along with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) daughter Anya, who has been with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) there since Easter of that year; Yasha, a young manservant who has accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) travels; and Charlotte, Anya's governess, who brings along her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) dog. Also accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) are Firs, her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) 87-year old manservant; her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) elder, yet still infantile, brother Leonid Gayev; and her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) adopted daughter Varya; these last three have stayed in Russia but went to the station to greet Ranevsky on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) return Ranevksy expresses her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) joy and amazement to be home again, while Anya reveals to Varya the relative poverty in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) mother when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) arrived in Paris and the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) continues to spend money. Varya reveals that the family's estate is to be sold at auction on the 22nd of August, in order to pay their debts. Anya reveals that Ranevsky's departure for Paris was caused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) grief over two deaths: that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) husband six years before and that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) son, Grisha, who drowned a month thereafter. Soon, Anya departs for bed, and Lopakhin brings up the issue of the imminent sale. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) proposes a solution; Ranevksy should parcel out the land on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) estate, build cottages on the parcels, and lease them out to summer cottage-holders, who are becoming increasingly numerous. Gayev and Ranevsky dismiss thr idea, because it would necessitate cutting down the family's beloved -LRB-and gigantic-RRB- cherry orchard. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) leaves, Lopakhin offers them a loan of 50,000 rubles to buy their property at auction if they change their minds, and predicts there will be no other way of saving the orchard. Ranevsky then lends some money to a fellow impoverished landowner, Boris Simeonov-Pischik. Peter Trofimov arrives; he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was Grisha's tutor before the drowning, and thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) brings back painful memories for Ranevsky. Before the end of the act, after complaining about Ranevksy's inability to curb her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) spending, Gayev outlines three alternatives to Lopakhin's plan: a financing scheme involving some banker friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>), Ranevsky borrowing some money from Lopakhin -LRB-without the condition that they then cut down the orchard-RRB-, and a wealthy aunt in Yaroslavl who might provide a loan. In the Second Act, we are introduced more closely to the young servants on the estate, Dunyasha, Yasha, and Yephikodov, who are involved in a love triangle: Yephikodov loves Dunyasha, Dunyasha loves Yasha, and Yasha is very much in love with himself. Soon, Lopakhin, Ranevsky, Gayev, Anya and Varya appear, and they are again debating over Lopakhin's plan to turn the orchard into cottage country. Lopakhin becomes frustrated with Ranevsky's reluctance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>), in turn, thinks his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunyasha</b></font>) plan is vulgar, and says that if they plan to sell the cherry orchard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) wants to be sold along with it. Ranevsky reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) has a lover in Paris who has been sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) telegrams, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) to return, and who robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>), left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>), and as a result drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) to a suicide attempt. Soon, Trofimov appears, and gives several speeches about the importance of work and the laziness and stupidity of Russian intellectuals. In a quiet moment, the sound of a snapping string is heard, and no one can identify its source. A drunkard appears, asking for directions, and then money; Ranevsky ends up giving him (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) several gold pieces. Disturbed, most of the group leave, except for Anya and Trofimov. They discuss Varya's growing suspicion that Anya and Trofimov are having an affair, which they are not; Trofimov declares that they are <div class="bookquote">``above love'' (<font color='red'><b>Trofimov</b></font>)</div>. The act ends with Yephikodov sadly playing his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) guitar and Varya calling out, in vain, for Anya. In the Third Act, Ranevsky throws a party on the day of the auction. The guests consist of several local bureaucratic officials such as the stationmaster and a post-office clerk. Charlotte entertains the guests with a series of magic tricks. Ranevsky worries anxiously about why Gayev and Lopakhin have not yet returned. Ranevsky fears that the orchard has been lost, that the aunt in Yaroslavl has apparently not given them enough money to buy it, and that Gayev's other sources have failed to come through. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) and Trofimov get into an argument; Trofimov accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) of not being able to face the truth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) accuses him (<font color='blue'><b>guests</b></font>) of being unusual for never having fallen in love. Lopakhin and Gayev soon return from the auction. Lopakhin reveals to everyone that he (<font color='blue'><b>guests</b></font>) has bought the estate and intends to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>guests</b></font>) plans for the orchard's destruction. Anya tries, in vain, to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) mother. In the last act, it is October, and the trees in the cherry orchard are already being cut down. All the characters are in the process of leaving; Lopakhin will depart to Kharkov for the winter, Varya to the Ragulins', another family that lives fifty miles away. Gayev plans to live in the town, working at a bank, Anya will go off to school, and Ranevksy will leave for Paris with Yasha, to rejoin her (<font color='blue'><b>Yasha</b></font>) lover. Charlotte has no idea what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) will do, but Lopakhin assures her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) will help her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) find something. Trofimov and Lopakhin exchange an affectionate if contentious farewell; Yasha leaves Dunyasha, weeping, without a second thought; and Anya tearfully says goodbye to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anya</b></font>) mother. Anya worries that Firs, who has taken ill, has not been sent to the hospital as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was supposed to be, but Yasha indignantly assures Anya that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) has. Ranevsky encourages Lopakhin to propose to Varya; but the proposal is never made--Lopakhin leaves Varya alone, and in tears. Finally, Gayev and Ranevsky bid a tearful farewell to their house. Everyone leaves, locking the doors behind them. But Firs is, in fact, accidentally left behind, having fallen ill and being forgotten in the rush of the departure. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) walks onstage after everyone else has left, quietly muttering about how life has left him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) by. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) lies on the couch, and silently expires as two sounds are heard; again, the sound of a string snapping, and the sound of an axe cutting down a cherry tree in the orchard.
