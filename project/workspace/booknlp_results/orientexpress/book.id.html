On the train there are two other passengers, Mary Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot. The two act as if they are strangers, but Poirot observes behavior that suggests that they are not. Poirot is suspicious of the couple. The train arrives in Stamboul and Poirot checks in at the Tokatlian Hotel. As soon as Poirot arrives he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) receives a telegram summoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) back to London. While waiting at the hotel for the next train, Poirot bumps into an old friend, M. Bouc, head of the Wagon Lit. M. Bouc arranges a space for Poirot on the Orient Express. In the dining room of the Tokatlian Hotel, Poirot first spots Ratchett and Hector McQueen eating dinner. Poirot know that Ratchett is an evil man and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) describes him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) to M. Bouc as an animal. Poirot board the Orient Express. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) is forced to ride in a second-class cabin because the train is unusually full. Ratchett and Hector McQueen are also aboard the train. Ratchett approaches Poirot and asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) will work for him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), Ratchett tells Poirot he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) has been receiving threatening letters and that someone is trying to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). Poirot refuses the case. M. Bouc has taken the last first class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) space in first class. The first night Poirot sleeps in first class, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, Poirot is wakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). The wagon lit conductor responds knocks on Ratchett's door and a voice from inside responds, <div class="bookquote">``Ce n'est rien. Je me suis trompe''  (<font color='red'><b>Ratchett</b></font>)</div>-LRB-It is nothing. I am mistaken-RRB-. Poirot has difficulty sleeping because there is a peculiar silence on the train. Mrs. Hubbard rings her (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) bell and tells the conductor a man is in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) room. Poirot rings his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) bell for water and is informed by the conductor that the train is stuck in a snow bank. Poirot hears a loud thump next door. The next morning, the train still stopped, M. Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard the train. Poirot tells M. Bouc he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) will investigate the case. Poirot first examines Ratchett's body and compartment. Ratchett has twelve stab wounds. The window is left open in Ratchett's compartment, presumably to make the investigators think the murderer escaped out the window, but there are no footprints outside the window in the snow. A handkerchief with the initial <div class="bookquote">``H''  (<font color='red'><b>Ratchett</b></font>)</div>is found in the compartment, a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used and a charred piece of paper with the name <div class="bookquote">``Armstrong''  (<font color='red'><b>Ratchett</b></font>)</div>on it. The piece of paper with the word Armstrong on it helps Poirot figure out who Ratchett really is and why someone would want to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). A few years back, a man named Cassetti kidnapped a three-year old girl, Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child anyways. Poirot concludes that Ratchett is Cassetti. The interviews start with the Wagon Lit conductor, then Hector McQueen. Poirot knows that McQueen is involved with the case because he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) knows about the Armstrong note found in Ratchett's compartment, Hector is surprised that Poirot found the note because he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) thought it had been completely destroyed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) interviews Masterman and then Mrs. Hubbard. Mrs. Hubbard claims that the murderer was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) cabin. All of the passengers give Poirot suitable alibis during their interviews, although a few suspicious elements are brought to light: many passengers observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway the night of the murder, but no one admits they have a red kimono. Mrs. Hubbard tells Poirot she (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) had Greta Ohlsson lock the communicating door between she (<font color='blue'><b>Ohlsson</b></font>) and Ratchett. Hildegarde Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagon Lit jacket. Poirot checks every passenger's luggage. During the check he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) notices a few interesting things: the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, a Wagon Lit uniform is found in Hildegarde Schmidt's bag and, lastly, the red kimono is found in Poirot's own luggage. After the luggage check, Poirot, Dr. Constantine and M. Bouc review the facts of the case and develop a list of questions. With the evidence and questions in mind, Poirot sits and thinks about the case. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) surfaces from a somewhat trance-like state, Poirot has discovered the solution to the case. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) reveals this solution in full, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) calls in several people and reveals their true identities. Poirot discovers Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, aunt of Daisy Armstrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) wet her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) luggage label and obscured her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) name, in an effort to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) identity. Also, Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess, Antonio Foscanelli was the Armstrong's chaffer, Masterman the valet, and Greta Ohlsson was Daisy Armstrong's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff claims her (<font color='blue'><b>Ohlsson</b></font>) handkerchief from Poirot, the same found in Ratchett's compartment. Poirot gathers all of the passengers into the dining car and propounds two possible solutions. The fist solution is that a stranger entered the train at Vincovci and killed Ratchett. The second solution is that all of the passengers aboard the Orient Express were involved with the murder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) argues that twelve of the thirteen passengers, all close to the Armstrong case, killed Ratchett to avenge the murder of Daisy Armstrong. Mrs. Hubbard, revealed as Linda Arden, admits that the second solution is correct. Poirot suggests that M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine tell the police that the first solution is correct to protect the family. M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine accept Poirot's suggestion.
