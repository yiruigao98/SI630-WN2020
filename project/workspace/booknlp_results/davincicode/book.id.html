apprehends Jacques Saunière, the museum's curator, and demands to
know where the Holy Grail is. After Saunière tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>), Silas shoots him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>)
and leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) to die. However, Saunière has lied to Silas about
the Grail's location. Realizing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) has only a few minutes to
live and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) must pass on his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) important secret, Saunière paints
a pentacle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) stomach with his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) own blood, draws a circle with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) blood, and drags himself into the center of the circle, re-creating
the position of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) also
leaves a code, a line of numbers, and two lines of text on the ground
in invisible ink. A police detective, Jerome Collet, calls Robert Langdon,
the story's protagonist and a professor of symbology, and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>)
to come to the Louvre to try to interpret the scene. Langdon does
not yet realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) himself is suspected of the murder. After murdering Saunière, Silas calls the <div class="bookquote">``Teacher''  (<font color='red'><b>Silas</b></font>)</div>and
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) that, according to Saunière, the keystone is in the Church
of Saint-Sulpice in Paris. The Teacher sends Silas there. Silas
follows Saunière's clues to the keystone's location and discovers
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) has been tricked. In a fit of rage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) kills Sister Sandrine
Bieil, the church's keeper and a sentry for the Priory of Sion.
At the Louvre, Langdon meets Jerome Collet and Bezu Fache, the police
captain, and realizes that the two policemen suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) of the
murder. Sophie Neveu, an agent of the department of cryptology
and Saunière's granddaughter, arrives at the crime scene and tells
Langdon that he (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) must call the embassy. When Langdon calls the number Sophie
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) reaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) answering service. The message warns Langdon
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) is in danger and should meet Sophie in the bathroom at the
Louvre. In the bathroom, Sophie shows Langdon that Fache is noting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) movements with a tracking device. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) throws the device out
the window onto a passing truck, tricking the police into thinking
that Langdon has escaped from the Louvre. Sophie also tells Langdon that the last line in the secret
message, <div class="bookquote">``P.S. Find Robert Langdon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Langdon/Robert Langdon</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) grandfather's way of
alerting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>): P.S. are the initials of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) grandfather's nickname
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>), Princesse Sophie. Langdon thinks that
P.S. might stand for Priory of Sion, an ancient brotherhood devoted
to the preservation of the pagan goddess worship tradition, and
to the maintenance of the secret that Saunière died protecting. Langdon decodes the second and third lines in Saunière's
message: <div class="bookquote">``Leonardo Da Vinci! The Mona Lisa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Saunière</b></font>)</div>Sophie
returns to the paintings to look for another clue. The police have
returned to the Louvre as well, and they arrest Langdon. Sophie
finds a key behind the Madonna of the Rocks. By
using the painting as a hostage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) manages to disarm the police
officer and get herself and Langdon out of the building. As Sophie and Langdon drive toward the Swiss bank identified on
the back of the key, Langdon explains the history of the Priory
of Sion and their armed force, the Knights Templar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) reveals that
the Priory protects secret documents known as the Sangreal,
or the Holy Grail. Langdon's latest manuscript is about this very
subject. When Sophie and Langdon enter the bank, an unnamed security guard
realizes that they are fugitives and calls the police, but André Vernet,
the bank's manager and a friend of Saunière's, recognizes Sophie
and helps her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) and Langdon escape. Sophie and Langdon figure out
that the number left near Saunière's body must be the account number
that will open the vault. When they open the vault they find a cryptex,
a message delivery device designed by Da Vinci and crafted by Saunière.
The cryptex can only be opened with a password. Vernet successfully smuggles Sophie and Langdon past Collet
in the back of a locked armored car. Vernet turns on them, but they manage
to get away with the cryptex, which Langdon realizes is actually
the Priory keystone--that is, the key to all of the secrets the Priory
holds about the location of the Holy Grail. Langdon and Sophie go to the house of Sir Leigh Teabing,
a historian, to ask for his (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) help opening the box. Teabing tells
them the legend of the Grail, starting with the historical evidence
that the Bible didn't come straight from God but was compiled by
Emperor Constantine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Constantine</b></font>) also cites evidence that Jesus' divinity
was decided by a vote at Nicaea, and that Jesus was married to Mary
Magdalene, who was of royal blood, and had children by her (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalene</b></font>). Teabing
shows them the hidden symbols in The Last Supper and
the painted representation of the Magdalene. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) tells them that
the Holy Grail is actually Mary Magdalene's body and the documents
that prove Mary's blood line is related to Jesus. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) thinks
Saunière and the others may have been killed because the Church
suspected that the Priory was about to unveil this secret. As Langdon is showing off the cryptex, Silas appears and
hits him (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) over the head. Silas holds Sophie and Teabing at gunpoint
and demands the keystone, but Teabing attacks Silas, hitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>)
on the thigh where his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) punishment belt is located, and Sophie finishes
him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) off by kicking him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) in the face. They tie Silas up. Collet arrives at the castle, but Sophie, Langdon, the
bound Silas, Teabing, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) servant, Rémy, escape and board Teabing's
private plane to England. Sophie realizes that the writing on the
cryptex is decipherable if viewed in a mirror. They come to understand
the poem, which refers to <div class="bookquote">``a headstone praised by Templars''  (<font color='red'><b>Langdon/Robert Langdon</b></font>)</div>and
the <div class="bookquote">``Atbash cipher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Langdon/Robert Langdon</b></font>)</div>which will help them arrive at the password.
Langdon remembers that the Knights Templar supposedly worshipped the
god Baphomet, who is sometimes represented by a large stone head.
The word, unscrambled by the Atbash Cipher, is Sofia.
When they open the cryptex, however, they find only another cryptex,
this one with a clue about a tomb where a knight was buried by a
pope. They must find the orb that should have been on the knight's
tomb. Fache realizes that Teabing and the rest of them are in
the jet. He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) calls the British police and asks them to surround the
airfield, but Teabing tricks the police into believing that there
is nobody inside the plane but himself. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) goes with Sophie,
Langdon, Rémy, and Silas to the Temple Church in London, the burial
site of knights that the Pope had killed. Rémy frees Silas and reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>), too, follows the
Teacher. Silas goes to the church to get the keystone, but when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) tries to force Langdon to give it up, Langdon threatens to break
it. Rémy intervenes, taking Teabing hostage and thus forcing Langdon
to give up the cryptex. Meanwhile, Collet and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collet</b></font>) men look through Teabing's house and
become suspicious when they find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collet</b></font>) has been monitoring Saunière.
Over the phone, the Teacher instructs Silas to let Rémy deliver
the cryptex. The Teacher meets Rémy in the park and kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Rémy</b></font>). The
Teacher calls the police and turns Silas in to the authorities.
As Silas tries to escape, he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) is shot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) accidentally shoots
his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) idol, Bishop Aringarosa. Silas takes Bishop Aringarosa to the hospital and staggers
into a park, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) dies. In the hospital the next day, Aringarosa
bitterly reflects that Teabing tricked him (<font color='blue'><b>Aringarosa</b></font>) into helping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Aringarosa</b></font>)
murderous plan by claiming that if the Bishop delivered the Grail
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) would help the Opus Dei regain favor with the Church. Sophie's and Langdon's research leads them to the discovery
that Sir Isaac Newton is the knight they are looking for, the one
buried by a Pope, because they learn he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) was buried by Alexander
Pope. They go to Westminster Abbey, where Newton is buried. There,
the Teacher lures them to the garden with a note saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) has Teabing. They
go there only to discover that Teabing himself is the Teacher. Teabing
suspected that Saunière had decided not to release the secret of
the Priory of Sion, because the Church threatened to kill Sophie
if the secret was released. Wanting the secret to be public knowledge,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) had decided to find the Grail himself. Teabing gives Langdon the cryptex and asks Langdon and Sophie
to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) open it. Langdon figures out that the password is apple--the
orb missing from Newton's tomb. He (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) opens the cryptex and secretly
takes out the papyrus. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) throws the empty cryptex in the air,
causing Teabing to drop his (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) pistol as he (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) attempts to catch it and
prevent the map inside from being destroyed. Suddenly, Fache bursts
into the room and arrests Teabing. The papyrus inside the second cryptex directs Sophie and
Langdon to Scotland, where Sophie finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) brother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) grandmother.
During the reunion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) discovers that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) family is, indeed, of
the bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Sophie and Langdon part,
promising to meet in Florence in a month. Back in Paris, Langdon
comprehends the poem, which leads him (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) to the small pyramid built
into the ground in the Louvre, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Langdon</b></font>) is sure the Grail must be
hidden.
