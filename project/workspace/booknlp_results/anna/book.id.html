torn apart by adultery. Dolly Oblonskaya has caught her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) husband,
Stiva, having an affair with their children's former governess, and
threatens to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Stiva is somewhat remorseful but mostly
dazed and uncomprehending. Stiva's sister, Anna Karenina, wife of
the St. Petersburg government official Karenin, arrives at the Oblonskys'
to mediate. Eventually, Anna is able to bring Stiva and Dolly to
a reconciliation. Meanwhile, Dolly's younger sister, Kitty, is courted by
two suitors: Konstantin Levin, an awkward landowner, and Alexei
Vronsky, a dashing military man. Kitty turns down Levin in favor
of Vronsky, but not long after, Vronsky meets Anna Karenina and
falls in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Karenina</b></font>) instead of Kitty. The devastated Kitty falls
ill. Levin, depressed after having been rejected by Kitty, withdraws
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) estate in the country. Anna returns to St. Petersburg, reflecting
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) infatuation with Vronsky, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arrives home she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dismisses
it as a fleeting crush. Vronsky, however, follows Anna to St. Petersburg, and
their mutual attraction intensifies as Anna begins to mix with the
freethinking social set of Vronsky's cousin Betsy Tverskaya. At
a party, Anna implores Vronsky to ask Kitty's forgiveness; in response,
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) tells Anna that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Karenin goes home from the party alone,
sensing that something is amiss. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) speaks to Anna later that night
about his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) suspicions regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and Vronsky, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) curtly dismisses
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) concerns. Some time later, Vronsky participates in a military officers'
horse race. Though an accomplished horseman, he (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) makes an error during the
race, inadvertently breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) horse's back. Karenin notices his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>)
wife's intense interest in Vronsky during the race. He (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) confronts Anna
afterward, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) candidly admits to Karenin that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is having
an affair and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) loves Vronsky. Karenin is stunned. Kitty, meanwhile, attempts to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) health at a
spa in Germany, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) meets a pious Russian woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) do-gooder protégée,
Varenka. Kitty also meets Levin's sickly brother Nikolai, who is
also recovering at the spa. Levin's intellectual half-brother, Sergei Koznyshev, visits
Levin in the country and criticizes him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) for quitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) post on
the local administrative council. Levin explains that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) resigned
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found the work bureaucratic and useless. Levin works
enthusiastically with the peasants on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) estate but is frustrated
by their resistance to agricultural innovations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) visits Dolly,
who tempts him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with talk of reviving a relationship with Kitty.
Later, Levin meets Kitty at a dinner party at the Oblonsky household,
and the two feel their mutual love. They become engaged and marry. Karenin rejects Anna's request for a divorce. He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) insists
that they maintain outward appearances by staying together. Anna
moves to the family's country home, however, away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) encounters Vronsky often, but their relationship becomes clouded after
Anna reveals she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is pregnant. Vronsky considers resigning his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) military
post, but his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) old ambitions prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Karenin, catching Vronsky at the Karenin country home
one day, finally agrees to divorce. Anna, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) childbirth agony,
begs for Karenin's forgiveness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) suddenly grants it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) leaves
the divorce decision in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) resents his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) generosity
and does not ask for a divorce. Instead, Anna and Vronsky go to
Italy, where they lead an aimless existence. Eventually, the two
return to Russia, where Anna is spurned by society, which considers
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) adultery disgraceful. Anna and Vronsky withdraw into seclusion, though
Anna dares a birthday visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) young son at Karenin's home.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) begins to feel great jealousy for Vronsky, resenting the fact
that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is free to participate in society while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is housebound and
scorned. Married life brings surprises for Levin, including his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)
sudden lack of freedom. When Levin is called away to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dying
brother Nikolai, Kitty sparks a quarrel by insisting on accompanying
him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>). Levin finally allows her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>). Ironically, Kitty is
more helpful to the dying Nikolai than Levin is, greatly comforting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) final days. Kitty discovers she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) is pregnant. Dolly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) family
join Levin and Kitty at Levin's country estate for the summer. At
one point, Stiva visits, bringing along a friend, Veslovsky, who
irks Levin by flirting with Kitty. Levin finally asks Veslovsky
to leave. Dolly decides to visit Anna, and finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) radiant and
seemingly very happy. Dolly is impressed by Anna's luxurious country
home but disturbed by Anna's dependence on sedatives to sleep. Anna
still awaits a divorce. Levin and Kitty move to Moscow to await the birth of their
baby, and they are astonished at the expenses of city life. Levin
makes a trip to the provinces to take part in important local elections,
in which the vote brings a victory for the young liberals. One day,
Stiva takes Levin to visit Anna, whom Levin has never met. Anna enchants
Levin, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) success in pleasing Levin only fuels her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) resentment
toward Vronsky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) grows paranoid that Vronsky no longer loves
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Meanwhile, Kitty enters labor and bears a son. Levin is confused
by the conflicting emotions he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feels toward the infant. Stiva goes
to St. Petersburg to seek a cushy job and to beg Karenin to grant
Anna the divorce he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) once promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Karenin, following the advice
of a questionable French psychic, refuses. Anna picks a quarrel with Vronsky, accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of putting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mother before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and unfairly postponing plans to go to the
country. Vronsky tries to be accommodating, but Anna remains angry. When
Vronsky leaves on an errand, Anna is tormented. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a
telegram urgently calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) home, followed by a profusely apologetic
note. In desperation, Anna drives to Dolly's to say goodbye, and
then returns home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) resolves to meet Vronsky at the train station
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) errand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) rides to the station in a stupor. At the
station, despairing and dazed by the crowds, Anna throws herself
under a train and dies. Two months later, Sergei's book has finally been published,
to virtually no acclaim. Sergei represses his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergei</b></font>) disappointment by
joining a patriotic upsurge of Russian support for Slavic peoples
attempting to free themselves from Turkish rule. Sergei, Vronsky,
and others board a train for Serbia to assist in the cause. Levin
is skeptical of the Slavic cause, however. Kitty becomes worried by Levin's gloomy mood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has become immersed
in questions about the meaning of life but feels unable to answer
them. One day, however, a peasant remarks to Levin that the point
of life is not to fill one's belly but to serve God and goodness. Levin
receives this advice as gospel, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life is suddenly transformed
by faith. Later that day, Levin, Dolly, and Dolly's children seek
shelter from a sudden, violent thunderstorm, only to discover that
Kitty and Levin's young son are still outside. Levin runs to the
woods and sees a huge oak felled by lightning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fears the worst,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and child are safe. For the first time, Levin feels
real love for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) son, and Kitty is pleased. Levin reflects again
that the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life lies in the good that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) can put into
it.
