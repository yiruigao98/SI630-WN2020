Hephaestus, whose job is to chain Prometheus to the rock, follows them. Kratus states that this is a punishment for giving fire to human beings, and Prometheus must learn to like Zeus's rule. Hephaestus expresses his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) pity for Prometheus, lamenting the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) must bind his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) friend to the rock. Kratus urges him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) on, insisting that pity for Zeus's enemies is both useless and dangerous. Hephaestus finishes his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) task and leaves with Kratus and Bia. Prometheus calls on nature to witness the suffering of a god at the hands of other gods, specifically the new ruler Zeus. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) mentions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) has the gift of prophecy and knows all that will happen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) must live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) suffering because no one can fight fate. Prometheus hears the sound of wings and discovers that it is the Chorus of Oceanids, daughters of Oceanus, on winged chariots. The Oceanids express their sympathy for Prometheus's suffering, explaining that the new ruler of Olympus follows only his (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) own laws. Prometheus prophecies that one days Zeus will be in danger and will be forced to befriend him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) to avoid it. Asked what crime he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) has committed to deserve this punishment, Prometheus recounts the war between Zeus and the Titans. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) had tried to help the Titans, but they refused his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) guile and decided to use force. Prometheus then offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) guile to Zeus, helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) win. Now Zeus punishes him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) because like all tyrants he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) distrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) friends. Zeus had planned to destroy humanity but Prometheus stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) way. Questioned further, Prometheus recounts that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) gave humanity blind hope and also the gift of fire. The Chorus responds to this last admission, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) has sinned, but Prometheus replies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) did so willingly and will not now renounce his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) action. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) asks the Chorus to come down to earth so he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) can tell them the whole story. Oceanus flies in on a winged beast and says that Prometheus should stop provoking Zeus while he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) himself goes to the god to have Prometheus freed. Prometheus responds that talking to Zeus would be useless and Oceanus should not place himself in danger by getting involved. Oceanus argues that words are needed for healing, but Prometheus counters that the medicine must be applied at the proper time. Convinced by Prometheus's categorical refusal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) help, Oceanus departs. The Chorus sings that the entire old world mourns for Prometheus and his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) brothers who also suffer at the hands of Zeus, especially Atlas who must hold the world. Prometheus summarizes everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) has done for humanity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) taught human beings agriculture, language, mathematics, harnessing of animals, and sailing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) also taught medicine, divination, and mining. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) insists that all human arts come from him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>). Prometheus almost reveals his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) prophecy to the Chorus, but stops himself, saying only that it will free him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) because Zeus is a slave to necessity like all others. The Oceanids affirm their piety to Zeus, chide Prometheus for helping mortals who cannot help him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) back, and remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) happy wedding to their sister. Io enters wearing cow horns. Screaming that a gadfly is biting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and the ghost of Argos pursues her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) calls on Zeus and asks why he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) tortures her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) like this. In response to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) questions, Prometheus reveals who he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) is and why he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) is being punished. Io asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) future wanderings, but first the Chorus asks to know of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) past suffering. Io tells how Zeus became infatuated with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and forced her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) house. Io was turned into a cow and guarded by Argos, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) was killed and returned as a ghost along with a gadfly that drove her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) around the world. Prometheus tells her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) future wanderings through Europe, Asia, and Africa, where she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must constantly avoid dangerous peoples and monsters. Prometheus reveals that Zeus, who makes Io suffer, will one day choose a mate whose son will depose his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) father. Only Prometheus can help Zeus prevent this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) reveals also that one day Io's descendant will free him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) then concludes the story of Io's journey, telling how at the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) suffering Zeus will cure and impregnate her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with a gentle touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) hand. Prometheus talks about Io's descendants, who will become kings of the city Argos. Io runs off again tortured by the gadfly, and the Oceanids chant about the dangers of marrying above one's own rank, expressing the hope that Zeus never takes an interest in them. Angered by Io's suffering, Prometheus shouts out that Zeus's own son will topple him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>). Zeus's messenger Hermes enters and orders Prometheus to reveal the identity of this son's mother. Prometheus mocks Hermes and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) will tell nothing. Hermes accuses Prometheus of being overly obstinate, disobedient, and mad. Prometheus deflects each accusation with direct insults or sarcasm. Hermes warns that if Prometheus does not yield, a storm will send him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) to Tartarus. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) will emerge only to have an eagle eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) liver every day, and this will not end until a god agrees to die for him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>). The Chorus advises Prometheus to yield, but he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) shows no fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) destiny. Hermes orders the Oceanids away, but they reply that to betray a friend is the worst crime of all and vow to stay with Prometheus. As the earth begins to shake and thunder gathers around him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), Prometheus calls on the elements to witness his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) suffering.
