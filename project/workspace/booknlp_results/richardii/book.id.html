Richard II, who ascended to the throne as a young man, is a regal and stately figure, but he (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) is wasteful in his (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) spending habits, unwise in his (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) choice of counselors, and detached from his (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) country and its common people. He (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) spends too much of his (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) time pursuing the latest Italian fashions, spending money on his (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) close friends, and raising taxes to fund his (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) pet wars in Ireland and elsewhere. When he (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) begins to <div class="bookquote">``rent out''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>parcels of English land to certain wealthy noblemen in order to raise funds for one of his (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) wars, and seizes the lands and money of a recently deceased and much respected uncle to help fill his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) coffers, both the commoners and the king's noblemen decide that Richard has gone too far. Richard has a cousin, named Henry Bolingbroke, who is a great favorite among the English commoners. Early in the play, Richard exiles him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) from England for six years due to an unresolved dispute over an earlier political murder. The dead uncle whose lands Richard seizes was the father of Bolingbroke; when Bolingbroke learns that Richard has stolen what should have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) inheritance, it is the straw that breaks the camel's back. When Richard unwisely departs to pursue a war in Ireland, Bolingbroke assembles an army and invades the north coast of England in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bolingbroke</b></font>) absence. The commoners, fond of Bolingbroke and angry at Richard's mismanagement of the country, welcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) invasion and join his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) forces. One by one, Richard's allies in the nobility desert him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and defect to Bolingbroke's side as Bolingbroke marches through England. By the time Richard returns from Ireland, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has already lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) grasp on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) country. There is never an actual battle; instead, Bolingbroke peacefully takes Richard prisoner in Wales and brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) back to London, where Bolingbroke is crowned King Henry IV. Richard is imprisoned in the remote castle of Pomfret in the north of England, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is left to ruminate upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) downfall. There, an assassin, who both is and is not acting upon King Henry's ambivalent wishes for Richard's expedient death, murders the former king. King Henry hypocritically repudiates the murderer and vows to journey to Jerusalem to cleanse himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) part in Richard's death. As the play concludes, we see that the reign of the new King Henry IV has started off inauspiciously.
