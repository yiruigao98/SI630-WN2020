a man named Samuel Hamilton settles in the Salinas Valley in northern
California. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) brings his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) strict but loving wife, Liza, with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>)
from Ireland. Although Samuel is well respected in the community,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) never becomes a wealthy man. The Hamiltons go on to have nine
children and become a prominent family in the valley. Adam Trask, meanwhile, settles in the valley with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trask</b></font>)
pregnant wife Cathy where he (<font color='blue'><b>Trask</b></font>) eventually becomes friends with Samuel Hamilton.
Before moving to California, Adam lives on a farm in Connecticut
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) half-brother, Charles. The dark and moody Charles resents
the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and Adam's father, Cyrus, has always favored the
good-natured Adam. Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) death, Cyrus leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrus</b></font>) sons a large
and unexpected fortune, probably stolen during his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrus</b></font>) days as an administrator
in the U.S. Army. Despite their newfound wealth, Adam and Charles
remain unable to get along. Charles is disgusted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
brother's marriage to Cathy, who, unbeknownst to Adam or Charles,
is a former prostitute who murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) parents and stole their
money. Although Charles despises Cathy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bed
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) drugs Adam on their wedding night. Adam and Cathy move to California, as Adam proves unable
to live peacefully with Charles in Connecticut. In Salinas, Cathy
learns she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) is pregnant and attempts to abort her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) baby in order to
prevent any furtherance of ties to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) is desperate
to escape Adam despite the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) and provides for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>). The abortion is unsuccessful, and Cathy eventually gives birth
to twins, Aron and Caleb -LRB-Cal-RRB-. It is clear from the start, however,
that Cathy does not care about the infants and wants to leave the
household as soon as possible. One day, Cathy shoots Adam, flees
the house, and moves to Salinas proper to resume her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) life as a prostitute.
Adam decides to cover for Cathy by lying to the local sheriff and
saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) gunshot wound was an accident. Cathy wins the trust of Faye, the madam of a local brothel,
then poisons her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) and fools the doctors and other prostitutes into
thinking that Faye died naturally. Cathy assumes control of the
brothel and starts to blackmail powerful men in Salinas with photographs
of them performing sadomasochistic sex acts with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) prostitutes.
To protect the dazed Adam and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) twin boys, neither Samuel Hamilton
nor Lee, Adam's housekeeper, tells Adam or the boys that Cathy works
at a brothel. As the twins grow older, Aron manifests his (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) father's good
heart, whereas Cal exhibits his (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) mother's ruthlessness and tendency
to manipulate. By the time they reach early adolescence, however,
Cal actively struggles against his (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) dark side and prays to God to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) more like Aron. Adam, meanwhile, remains melancholy and listless
for years after Cathy's departure. In order to jolt Adam out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
despondency, Samuel finally tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) the truth about Cathy. Samuel
dies soon afterward. After Samuel's funeral, Adam visits Cathy at the brothel.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) deteriorating body and cynical, vulgar talk make Adam realize
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) can now move on and forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) is a repugnant creature who
has become irrelevant to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) life. Cathy, however, is desperate to
retain power over Adam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) even offers to have sex with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to keep
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in the brothel and prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) is no better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>). Adam
refuses and leaves with a serene smile. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) triumph over Cathy, Adam becomes a livelier
and more committed father to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) boys. Adam decides to move the
family off the ranch and into the town of Salinas so that Aron and
Cal can attend school. The twins are assigned to the seventh grade,
and Aron begins a relationship with Abra, the goodhearted daughter
of a corrupt county supervisor. Cal continues to struggle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>)
dark side, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) finally happens to discover the truth about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) believes that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) evil has been passed down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>).
But Adam's housekeeper, Lee, who has extensively researched the
biblical story of Cain and Abel, advises Cal that God intends each
individual to choose his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own moral destiny rather than be constrained by
the legacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) parents. This idea, encapsulated by the Hebrew word timshel -LRB-meaning
<div class="bookquote">``thou mayest'' (<font color='red'><b>Cal</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, counters Cal's fatalistic idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has inherited
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother's evil and sin. Aron gradually withdraws into religious fervor in order
to shield himself from the corruption of the world--an approach that
Abra and Lee consider cowardly. Adam, meanwhile, squanders the family
fortune on a poorly executed business venture involving refrigerated
shipping of vegetables. Aron graduates from high school early and
leaves for Stanford University. Adam misses Aron terribly, thinking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) smarter and more ambitious than Cal. However, Cal, in collaboration with Will Hamilton, one
of Samuel's sons, works secretly to earn back the fortune his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) father
lost on the failed refrigeration business. Cal also hopes to make
enough money to pay for Aron's tuition at Stanford. In the strained
economy of World War I, Will and Cal buy beans from local farmers
at an unfairly low price and sell the beans, in turn, to desperate
British buyers at an unfairly high price. The venture nets Cal thousands
of dollars, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) plans to give to his (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) father as a gift at Thanksgiving. Aron, who is miserable at Stanford, comes home for Thanksgiving.
Adam is thrilled to see Aron but appalled by Cal's gift of money. Adam
considers the money to be earned dishonestly and tells Cal to give
it back to the farmers from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stole it. Enraged and jealous
of Adam's obvious preference for Aron, Cal loses control of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) anger
and rashly tells Aron the truth about their mother, Cathy. When
Cal takes Aron to the brothel to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) that Cathy is still alive,
the revelation crushes the fragile Aron, who screams incoherently
and runs away. The next day, the shattered Aron joins the Army,
while Cathy, horrified by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) son's reaction to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>), commits suicide
by overdosing on morphine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) entire fortune--part of
it inherited from Charles, part of it earned through blackmail and
prostitution--to Aron. When Adam discovers that Aron has joined the Army, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>)
lapses into a state of shock. Lee talks to Cal about the idea of timshel and urges
Cal to remember that, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) guilt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) is a normal, flawed human
being--not an aberrant embodiment of evil. This discussion makes
Cal feel somewhat better, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>) is able to begin a relationship
with Abra, who is no longer in love with Aron. A telegram arrives informing the family that Aron has
been killed in World War I. Adam has a severe stroke upon
hearing the news, and Lee brings Abra and Cal to see Adam on his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
deathbed. Lee informs Adam that the guilt-stricken Cal told Aron
about their mother only because Cal was convinced
that their father loved Aron more than him (<font color='blue'><b>Aron</b></font>). Lee asks Adam to offer
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) blessing to Cal before he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) dies. At this, Adam raises his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hand
and whispers the single word timshel.
