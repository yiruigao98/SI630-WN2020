preparations and expectations for her (<font color='blue'><b>Shostak</b></font>) first trip to the Dobe region of Africa, in
northwest Botswana and at the edge of the Kalahari Desert. Shostak describes Nisa's
people, the Zhun/twasi -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``real people'' (<font color='red'><b>Nisa people</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, bushmen who are hunter-gatherers and members
of a racial group known as Khoisan. The Khoisan are considered by biologists to be
distinct from black Africans, with fair skin, high cheekbones, and an average height
of only about five feet. Shostak narrates from a position in the present, reflecting back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Shostak</b></font>)
experiences in Africa. -LRB-Nisa, too, tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Shostak</b></font>) stories in the past tense.-RRB- In the
introduction, Shostak says that her (<font color='blue'><b>Shostak</b></font>) motivation for coming to Africa was primarily to
learn about the internal lives of the !Kung people, whose more easily discernable
qualities -LRB-such as diet, life cycle, and demographics-RRB- had already been studied by
other anthropologists for years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Shostak</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Shostak</b></font>) husband join in the ongoing research,
Shostak feeling particularly inclined to study the women of the !Kung tribe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>)
learns the language and interviews a number of women, but it is Nisa who captures
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) attention most. Nisa answers Shostak's questions with colorful language and
vivid stories. After a few interviews, Nisa tells Shostak that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) mother wanted to
kill Nisa's younger brother right after he (<font color='blue'><b>Shostak</b></font>) was born so that Nisa could continue to
nurse. Shostak is taken aback and starts to doubt Nisa's truthfulness, but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
eventually comes to trust her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>). The rest of the book is divided into fifteen chapters, one for each of the
interviews Shostak has with Nisa during her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) first Dobe visit, plus an epilogue. Each
chapter opens with an overview by Shostak on the topic, theme, stage of life, or
experience Nisa is about to narrate. In these introductions, Shostak draws from
interviews with other !Kung men and women, work done by other anthropologists, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>)
own observations and analyses, and historical and geographical contexts. In Chapter 1, Nisa describes her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) early memories of accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) pregnant
mother as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) gives birth to Nisa's baby brother, Kumsa, and threatens to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) does not actually commit infanticide. In Chapter 2, Nisa recalls growing
up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) brother, playing with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), experiencing sibling hatred, and protecting
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) from harm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) mother's pregnancy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) fourth child, Kxamshe,
who dies young. In Chapter 3, Nisa describes the life of a hunter-gatherer, hunting
prey, celebrating the arrival of meat in the village, gathering roots and bulbs,
experiencing thirst in times of drought, and gorging on caterpillars in times of
rain. In Chapter 4, Nisa remembers what it was like to engage in sex play with other
children in the village for the first time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) recalls some of the boys' sexual
aggression toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) and other girls. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) notes that parents and children sleep in
the same hut, so that the children become aware of what their parents are doing when
they move under the blankets. In Chapter 5, Nisa tells Shostak about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) first two
marriages, one to a man named Bo, the other to a man named Tsaa. Both marriages end
quickly, as is typical of early <div class="bookquote">``trial''  (<font color='red'><b>Kung</b></font>)</div>marriages in !Kung society. Nisa also
describes her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) feelings of love for a man named Kantla, who is already married and
who invites her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) to be a co-wife, an offer that Nisa refuses. In Chapter 6, Nisa enters her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) first long marriage, to a man named Tashay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>)
and Tashay grow to love each other. Early in their marriage, Nisa experiences her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>)
first menstruation, and the women of the village enclose her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) in a hut and perform
the ritual ceremonies that accompany that momentous event in a !Kung woman's life.
Chapter 7 concerns the infrequent though not uncommon practice of adopting a
co-wife. Nisa tells of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) own brief experience with a co-wife Tashay brings to the
hut. Before long, Nisa drives the co-wife away and the marriage resumes as normal. Nisa takes on several lovers, as is common in !Kung society, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>)
becomes pregnant, as recounted in Chapter 8, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) husband gets very jealous. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) of infidelity and questions the baby's paternity. Nisa gives birth to a
baby girl, Chuko, who dies in infancy. In Chapter 9, Nisa describes her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) four
subsequent pregnancies. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has a baby girl, Nai, then miscarries, then has another
girl who dies young, and then has a son, Kxau. Chapter 10 begins with Shostak's observations of the !Kung's changing
environment and way of life, which have been increasingly influenced by neighboring
cattle-herding groups, the Tswana and the Herero. Nisa then discusses her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) marriage
to a Tswana man named Besa, as well as the complications of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) several love affairs
with other men. In Chapter 11, Nisa travels from the Tswana village back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>)
parents' village after learning her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) father has died. Soon after, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) mother dies,
and Nisa herself falls ill but is cured by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) elder brother, Dau, who is a healer.
Nisa begins working in the house of a European woman who lives near their village.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) also becomes pregnant with Besa's child but miscarries. In Chapter 12, Nisa
continues to tell Shostak about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) many lovers and also recalls being a child and
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother's affair.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) also explains to Shostak that the !Kung women talk freely with each other about
sex, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) asks Shostak if that isn't the same with all women. Chapter 13 deals with the !Kung belief in the spirit world and, in particular,
with the role spirits are thought to play in illness and healing. Nisa describes her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>)
father's and older brother's healing abilities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) also tells Shostak about how her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>)
mother taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) to go into a trance and about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) own once-potent capabilities as
a healer. In Chapter 14, Nisa painfully recounts the deaths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) two last
surviving children. Nai dies after being shoved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) husband, and Kxau succumbs to
serious illness after eating honey that the spirits have designated for the honey
badger. In Chapter 15, Nisa expresses hurt over the fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) husband no longer
wants to sleep with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) very often, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) feels she (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) has grown ugly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>)
mentions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) has been through menopause and asks Shostak for medicine to bring
back her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) menses. The epilogue briefly describes Shostak's return to Dobe in 1975, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>)
husband, and a graduate student conduct a research study on women's menstrual
cycles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) also meets with Nisa and interviews her (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kung</b></font>) finds Nisa to be calm
and in good spirits, and Nisa agrees when Shostak asks if it would be all right to
publish the interviews as a book.
