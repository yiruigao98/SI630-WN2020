As he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) prepares to teach his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) algebra class, the narrator remembers Sonny as a young boy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) students, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) realizes, could someday end up like Sonny, given the obstacles and hardships they face growing up in Harlem. At the end of the school day, the narrator heads home, but he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) notices that one of Sonny's old friends, who is always high and dirty, is waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) by the school. The two men walk together, talking about Sonny. The narrator simultaneously hates and pities Sonny's friend, who, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) problems, makes it painfully clear to the narrator just how difficult Sonny's drug-addicted life has been and how difficult it will continue to be. Time passes, but the narrator never writes to Sonny in prison until the narrator's young daughter, Grace, dies. Sonny writes a long letter back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) brother in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) tries to explain how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) ended up where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) is. The two brothers then stay in constant communication. When Sonny gets out of jail, the narrator is there for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) takes Sonny back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) own family's apartment. In an extended flashback, the narrator recalls how Sonny and their father used to fight with each other because they were so similar in spirit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) remembers the last day he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) mother while on leave from the army, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) to watch out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) that when his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) father was a young man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) own brother get run down by a car full of white men who never bothered to stop. The experience traumatized and damaged the narrator's father for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) life. After that conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) mother, the narrator went back into the army and didn't think about his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) brother again until their mother died. After the funeral, the two brothers sat and talked about Sonny's future. Sonny told his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) brother about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) dream of becoming a jazz pianist, which the narrator dismissed. The narrator arranged for Sonny to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) wife's family until Sonny graduated from college. Sonny reluctantly agreed to do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) didn't want to live in the house and spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) spare time playing the piano. Although Sonny loved the music, the rest of family had a hard time bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) constant practicing. While living with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) sister-in-law, Sonny got into trouble for skipping school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) tried to hide the truancy letters, but one eventually made it to the house. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) sister-in-law's mother confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>), Sonny admitted to spending all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) time in Greenwich Village, hanging out with musicians. The two fought, and Sonny realized what a burden he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>)'d been on the family. After two days, Sonny joined the navy. The narrator didn't know whether Sonny was dead or alive until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) received a postcard from Greece. After the war, the two brothers returned to New York, but they didn't see each other for quite some time. When they eventually met, they fought about Sonny's decisions in life. After one especially difficult fight, Sonny told his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) brother that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) could consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) dead from that point on. The narrator walked away, telling himself that one day Sonny would need his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) help. The flashback ends there. After having Sonny live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) for a few weeks, the narrator debates whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) should search Sonny's room. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) paces back and forth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) sees a street-corner revival occurring outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) window and thinks about its significance. Eventually Sonny comes home and invites his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) brother to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) perform later that evening. The two brothers go to a small jazz club where everyone knows and respects Sonny. Sonny and the band get on stage and play, and as they play, the narrator watches Sonny struggle with the music. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) watches all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) brother's struggles come pouring out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) plays, and only then does he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) finally realize who Sonny is and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>)'s made of.
