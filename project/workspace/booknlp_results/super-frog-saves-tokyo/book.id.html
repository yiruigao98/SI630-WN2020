Frog introduces himself and apologizes for barging into Katagiri's home, claiming to have an urgent matter to discuss. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) has come because Tokyo is about to be destroyed. Katagiri thinks that it must be a prank, but Frog assures him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) that they are the only ones present. Frog tells him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) isn't crazy and that Katagiri isn't dreaming. Confused and overwhelmed, Katagiri asks whether Frog is <div class="bookquote">``a real frog.''  (<font color='red'><b>Frog</b></font>)</div>Frog replies in the affirmative and demonstrates his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) realness by tilting back his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) head and letting out a wall-rattling series of ribits. Frog tells Katagiri that there will be an earthquake three days from now, much bigger than the one that struck Kobe a month earlier. More than 150,000 people will die, and the city's infrastructure will be destroyed. The epicenter will be right under Katagiri's bank office. Frog tells Katagiri that to stop the earthquake from happening, the two of them must go underground and do mortal combat with Worm. Frog explains that Worm is a giant worm that has slept deep beneath Tokyo for decades, his (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>) eyes and brain slowly atrophying. Worm absorbs reverberations as he (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>) sleeps and replaces those impulses with rage through a mysterious chemical process. When the rage builds to a certain level, he (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>) releases it in the form of an earthquake. Frog says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>) feels no personal animosity toward Worm but that Worm has nevertheless become too dangerous to ignore. Katagiri accepts this explanation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>) still doesn't understand why Frog has chosen him (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>) for the mission. Frog says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>)'s been watching Katagiri for a long time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>)'s seen Katagiri do the dirty, difficult work of collecting money from thugs without ever receiving the recognition he (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>) deserves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>)'s also seen the sacrifices Katagiri made for his (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>) siblings. Frog says there is no one in Tokyo he (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>) would rather have by his (<font color='blue'><b>Katagiri</b></font>) side in this battle. Katagiri suggests that Frog will be better off with someone who's stronger, maybe a martial arts expert. Frog waves him (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) off, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>)'ll do the fighting but needs Katagiri for moral support. Frog is also frightened and reluctant to fight Worm, but he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) quotes Nietzsche's maxim that <div class="bookquote">``the highest wisdom is to have no fear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Nietzsche</b></font>)</div>As a final reassurance, Frog offers to solve a sticky loan situation for Katagiri involving a company called Big Bear Trading. Then Frog flattens himself up and slips out through the door crack. The next morning, a lawyer calls Katagiri to say that that Big Bear will pay off all debts as long as Frog stays away. Frog comes to Katagiri's office at lunch. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) tells Katagiri not to worry because no one else can see him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)'s proven his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) existence, Frog wants confirmation that Katagiri will help him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) fight Worm. There will be no glory in their battle, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) warns, because no one besides the two of them will ever know it has taken place. Katagiri tries to convince Frog once again that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)'s not worthy, but Frog says that people like Katagiri are the reason why Tokyo is worth saving and that only someone like Katagiri could help him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) win the battle. Katagiri reluctantly agrees. Frog describes how the two of them will head underground through a hidden shaft in the bank's boiler room on February 17. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) assures Katagiri that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) has battle plans but refuses to divulge them when Katagiri asks for details. Katagiri pushes again, asking what Frog will do if Katagiri gets scared and runs away. Frog thinks and then answers that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would just have to fight alone, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would have about as much hope of defeating Worm alone as Anna Karenina would have had of beating the speeding locomotive that killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Frog seems disappointed that Katagiri has not read Tolstoy's novel. On the evening of the battle, however, Katagiri is shot while returning from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) collection rounds. A young man in a leather jacket jumps in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) and puts a slug in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) right shoulder. Other shots follow. Katagiri wakes up in a hospital, where the attending nurse explains that it's 9:15 a.m., February 18. Katagiri asks about the previous night's earthquake and is relieved to discover that nothing happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>)'s perplexed, however, to learn that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) wasn't shot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) was found lying unconscious on the street and had apparently been yelling Frog's name in the hospital all night long. Frog appears in Katagiri's hospital room that night, exhausted and wounded. Katagiri begins to apologize for not meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) in the boiler room, but Frog explains that Katagiri did help him (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>)--in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) dreams. The battle took place in the area of imagination, Frog explains. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) describes how Katagiri brought in a foot-powered generator to light Frog's way in the battle to fight off the encroaching darkness. In the end, Frog was unable to defeat Worm, able only to call a draw and prevent the earthquake from taking place. Frog then slips into a coma. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) begins to twitch, and boils break out all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) body. The boils pop, and creatures that look like worms, maggots, and centipedes start crawling out. Frog's eyeballs fall to the floor, where they're eaten by bugs. The entire room is covered with insects, blotting out the light, overwhelming Katagiri in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) screams. The nurse turns on the light, and the bugs are suddenly gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) gives Katagiri an injection and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) had another nightmare. Delirious, Katagiri tells the nurse that Frog sacrificed himself to save Tokyo from an earthquake. The nurse says that Katagiri must have been very fond of Frog. <div class="bookquote">``Locomotive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) says. <div class="bookquote">``More than anybody.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) wipes the sweat from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) brow as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) drifts into a deep sleep.
