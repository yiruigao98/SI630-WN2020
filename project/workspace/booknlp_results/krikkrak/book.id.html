Krak! contains nine stories and an epilogue. Although the
stories take place in Port-au-Prince or Ville Rose, Haiti, or New York, they do not
overlap. The only exception is <div class="bookquote">``Between the Pool and the Gardenias,''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>which mentions
women from earlier stories. All the stories are all about Haitian women trying to
understand their relationships to their families and to Haiti. The epilogue, <div class="bookquote">``Women
Like Us,''  (<font color='red'><b>these women</b></font>)</div>suggests that these women are related. The epilogue's unnamed narrator,
possibly Danticat herself, notices her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) similarity to her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) mother and female
ancestors. These women cook to express sorrow, but the narrator chooses to write.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) mother doesn't approve because Haitian writers are often killed. However, the
narrator's female ancestors are united in death, and she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) uses stories to keep their
history alive. Two nameless narrators are in love and write each other letters they will
never read. The female narrator is angry that her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) father opposes their love, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) finds out he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave up all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) possessions to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) from the
macoutes. The female narrator's family hears the
macoutes kill her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) neighbor, whose son was in the Youth
Federation. The male narrator, also a member, has fled Haiti. In his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) boat is a
pregnant teenager, Célianne, who was raped by a macoute. Days
after her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) baby dies, she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) throws it and herself overboard. The female narrator
sees a black butterfly and knows the male narrator has died too. <div class="bookquote">``Nineteen Thirty-Seven''  (<font color='red'><b>Josephine</b></font>)</div>is narrated by Josephine, whose mother is
imprisoned as a witch. Hours before Josephine's birth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) mother swam across a
blood-filled river to Haiti from the Dominican Republic, where Haitians were
slaughtered, including Josephine's grandmother. Every year, Josephine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>)
mother performed rituals at the Massacre River. When Josephine visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>)
increasingly frail mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never says anything, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brings a Virgin Mary
statue that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother makes cry using wax and oil. When Josephine's mother
dies, Jacqueline, another ritual performer, takes Josephine to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) body
burned. Guy, Lili, and their son, Little Guy, live in a one-room shack. They get
excited when Little Guy gets to play a revolutionary at school, and Guy gets
extra work cleaning bathrooms at a plantation. Little Guy spends all his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) time
learning lines while Guy dreams of stealing the plantation's hot air balloon.
Lili doesn't approve, but one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Lili</b></font>) sees Guy flying the balloon. Guy captures
the neighborhood's attention and jumps out. Little Guy recites the lines from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) play over Guy's dead body. <div class="bookquote">``Night Women''  (<font color='red'><b>a prostitute practices</b></font>)</div>concerns a prostitute who practices her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) profession next to
her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) young, sleeping son's bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) gets made up before bedtime
because she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>)'s waiting for an angel to come. She (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) worries he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)'ll someday find out
the truth, especially as she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) sees him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) becoming older and more sexually aware. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) ever wakes to find her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) regular married men, she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)
it's his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) father, visiting for one night. When he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) asks about the angels, she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>)
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) they haven't come yet. Marie finds a dead baby in the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) names it Rose and tells it
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) miscarriages, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) cheating husband, and the Dominican pool-cleaner who
slept with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) once. Marie pretends the household where she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) works belongs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
and imagines her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) female ancestors visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). When the baby rots, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) covers
it with perfume, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) finally decides the flies are trapping Rose's spirit
and buries Rose by the gardenias. The Dominican calls the police, claiming Marie
killed the baby for evil purposes. Emilie Gallant, Lamort's grandmother's boarder, asks Lamort to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
secretly to a mass grave where Emilie's mother, a supporter of the old
government, may have been dumped. A soldier tries to stop Emilie, who defies
him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). Lamort says <div class="bookquote">``peace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lamort</b></font>)</div>a password given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) by a flirtatious soldier, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) appears and says the password has changed. Emilie tells Lamort she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) doesn't
have to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) grandmother. Lamort's name means <div class="bookquote">``death''  (<font color='red'><b>Lamort</b></font>)</div>because her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) mother
died when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was born, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) goes home she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) demands to be called Marie
Magdalènene, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mother's name. Princesse passes a flirtatious drunk watching cockfights on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) way to
visit Catherine, a foreign painter. Princesse poses nude while Catherine paints
and talks about art. Princesse feels uncomfortable at first, but as long as no
one else can see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) relaxes. Sometimes Catherine paints her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) outdoors,
wearing clothes. When Catherine's mentor dies, Catherine goes to Paris without
telling Princesse. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) returns, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gives Princesses a nude painting of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
by the ocean. Princesse is inspired to create art herself and sketches the
cockfight-watching drunk in the sand. <div class="bookquote">``New York Day Women''  (<font color='red'><b>Suzette</b></font>)</div>takes place in New York rather than Haiti. Suzette
spots her (<font color='blue'><b>Suzette</b></font>) mother, who never leaves Brooklyn, in Midtown. As Suzette follows her (<font color='blue'><b>Suzette</b></font>)
mother, undetected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Suzette</b></font>) thinks about the critical things her (<font color='blue'><b>Suzette</b></font>) mother says about
family or Haiti or Suzette. In a playground, a woman wearing workout clothes
leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Suzette</b></font>) young son with Suzette's mother for an hour. Suzette's mother and the
son seem quite fond of each other. Suzette wonders whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Suzette</b></font>) mother would have
said hello, had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Grace's mother -LRB-Ma-RRB- is upset that Grace's sister, Caroline, is marrying
Eric, who isn't Haitian. Ma makes bone soup every day, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) believes will
end Caroline's engagement. Grace begins dreaming about her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) father, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) did
when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died of cancer. In order to get a visa, Grace's father married a widow,
then divorced her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) real family to the United States. Ma worries that
Caroline thinks no one but Eric will love her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>). Before the ceremony, Caroline
becomes very nervous, but Ma reassures her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>). There is a heavy sadness over the
family because they know Caroline will never again be as close to them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>)
has been all her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) life. Ma asks Grace to burn her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) belongings when she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) dies so no
one will feel sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>). Grace refuses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) father's grave to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) about the wedding and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) new U.S. citizenship, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) returns
home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) helps her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) mother make bone soup.
