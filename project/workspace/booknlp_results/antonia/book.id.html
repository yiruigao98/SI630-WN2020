City lawyer, gives an acquaintance a memoir of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) Nebraska
childhood in the form of a recollection of their mutual friend,
Ántonia Shimerda. This memoir makes up the bulk of the novel. Jim first arrives in Nebraska at the age of ten, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) makes the trip west to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) grandparents after finding himself
an orphan in Virginia. On the train out west, Jim gets his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) first
glimpse of the Shimerdas, a Bohemian immigrant family traveling
in the same direction. As fate would have it, the Shimerdas have taken up residence
in farm neighboring the Burdens'. Jim makes fast friends with the Shimerda
children, especially Ántonia, who is nearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) in age and eager
to learn English. Jim tutors Ántonia, and the two of them spend
much of the autumn exploring their new landscape together. In late January, tragedy strikes with the suicide of Mr.
Shimerda. After an emotional funeral, the Shimerdas retreat into
despair, and the Burdens struggle to be as accommodating as possible.
As a result of the hardships that the Shimerdas suffer, Ántonia
and Jim find that a wedge has been driven between them. A couple of years later, the Burdens decide to move into
town, and shortly thereafter Ántonia takes a job as a housekeeper
with a neighboring family, the Harlings. Jim begins to see more
of Ántonia once again, especially when a dancing pavilion comes
to town and enlivens the socialscene. Jim's high school years quickly come to a close, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
is offered a spot at the university in Lincoln. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) makes a great
success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) high school commencement speech and spends the summer
hard at work in preparation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) course of study. Before leaving,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) takes one last trip out to the countryside with Ántonia and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
friends, where they gather to reminisce about old times together. In Lincoln, Jim throws himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) studies, which
take up the majority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) time in the first year and a half of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) course. In the spring of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) second year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) begins to see a
good deal of Lena Lingard, a mutual friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and Ántonia's
who has always intrigued Jim. After a few months of theatergoing
and dalliances about town, Jim decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) needs to make a fresh
start of things and prepares to transfer to Harvard University for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) final two years of college. While Jim is away, Ántonia gets engaged to a local boy
and moves to Denver in order to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). Days before the wedding, the
boy -abandons Ántonia, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lingard</b></font>) returns to Nebraska heartbroken.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lingard</b></font>) covers up an unexpected pregnancy throughout its term, but in
giving birth to a daughter incurs the disapproval of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) family. However,
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) resolves totake care of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) baby and continues to work on the
farm with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)brother. After graduating from college, during the summer before
entering law school, Jim returns to Nebraska to be with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) grandparents. Upon
hearing of Ántonia's situation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) decides to drive out to the countryside
and visit her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). They spend a happy day together reliving old times,
and Jim parts with a promise to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) again very soon. Twenty years pass before Jim is able to visit Ántonia
again. In the intervening period, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) establishes himself as a prosperous
New York City lawyer, and Ántonia marries and has many children
with a man named Cuzak, also of Bohemian origin. Jim's visit to
the Cuzak farm is a happy one, with plenty of laughter and stories.
Ántonia and Jim renew their old ties, and Jim resolves to be in
closer contact with the Cuzaks in the -coming years. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) prepares to leave Nebraska and return to New York
City, Jim walks along the outskirts of town, near the overgrown
road that leads to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) childhood home. At peace with himself in
this familiar landscape, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) feels that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) life has come full circle,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) reflects in the moonlight on all that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) past with Ántonia
has meant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
