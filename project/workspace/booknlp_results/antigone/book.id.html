Antigone is the girl who will rise up alone and die young. Haemon, Antigone's dashing fiancé, chats with Ismene, her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) beautiful sister. Though one would have expected Haemon to go for Ismene, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) inexplicably proposed to Antigone on the night of a ball. Creon is king of Thebes, bound to the duties of rule. Next to the sisters' sits the Nurse and Queen Eurydice. Eurydice will knit until the time comes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) room and die. Finally three Guards play cards, indifferent to the tragedy before them. The Chorus recounts the events leading to Antigone's tragedy. Oedipus, Antigone and Ismene's father, had two sons, Eteocles and Polynices. Upon Oedipus' death, it was agreed that each would take the throne from one year to the next. After the first year, however, Eteocles, the elder, refused to step down. Polynices and six foreign princes marched on Thebes. All were defeated. The brothers killed each other in a duel, making Creon king. Creon ordered Eteocles buried in honor and left Polynices to rot on the pain of death. It is dawn, and the house is still asleep. Antigone sneaks in and the Nurse appears and asks where she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) has been. Suddenly Ismene enters, also asking where Antigone has been. Antigone sends the Nurse away for coffee. Ismene declares that they cannot bury Polynices and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) must understand Creon's intentions. Antigone refuses and bids Ismene to go back to bed. Suddenly Haemon enters and Antigone asks Haemon to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) strength. She (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) will never be able to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). Stupefied, Haemon departs. Ismene returns, terrified that Antigone will attempt to bury Polynices despite the daylight. Antigone reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) has already done so. Later that day, the nervous First Guard enters and informs Creon that someone covered Polynices's body with a little dirt last night. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) orders the guards to uncover the body and keep the matter secret. The Chorus appears and announces that the tragedy is on. Its spring is wound, and it will uncoil by itself. Unlike melodrama, tragedy is clean, restful, and flawless. In tragedy, everything is inevitable, hopeless, and known. All are bound to their parts. The Guards enter with the struggling Antigone. The First proposes that they throw a party. Creon appears, and the First explains that Antigone was found digging Polynices' grave by hand in broad daylight. Creon sends the guards out. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Polynices</b></font>) is certain no one saw Antigone arrested, he (<font color='blue'><b>Polynices</b></font>) orders her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) to bed, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) has been ill. Antigone replies that she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) will only go out again tonight. Creon asks if she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) being Oedipus's daughter puts her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) above the law. Like Oedipus, her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) death must seem the <div class="bookquote">``natural climax''  (<font color='red'><b>Oedipus</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) life. Creon, on the other hand, devotes himself only to the order of the kingdom. Antigone's marriage is worth more to Thebes than her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) death. Antigone insists that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) cannot save her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>). Enraged, Creon seizes her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) arm and twists her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) side. Antigone remarks that Creon is squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) arm too tightly, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) grasp no longer hurts. Creon releases her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) knows his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) reign makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) loathsome but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) has no choice. Antigone rejoins that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) should have said no; she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) can say no to anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) thinks vile. While ruined, she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) is a queen. Because Creon said yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) can only sentence her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) to death. Creon asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) then and live. Antigone replies that she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) is not here to understand, only to say no and die. Creon makes a final appeal, saying that Antigone needs to understand what goes on in the wings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) drama. As a child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) must have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) brothers made her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) parents unhappy. Polynices was a cruel, vicious voluptuary. Being too cowardly to imprison him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>), Oedipus let him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) join the Argive army. As soon as Polynices reached Argos, the attempts on Oedipus' life began. But Eteocles, Thebes' martyr, too plotted to overthrow his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) father. Both were gangsters. When Creon sent for their bodies, they were found mashed together in a bloody pulp. He (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) had the prettier one brought in. Dazed, Antigone moves to go her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) room. Creon urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) to find Haemon and marry quickly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) must not waste her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) life and its happiness. Antigone challenges his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) servile happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) is of the tribe that asks questions and hates man's hope. A distraught Ismene rushes in, begging Antigone's forgiveness and promising to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>). Antigone rejects her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) does not deserve to die with her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>). Ismene swears she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) will bury Polynices herself then. Antigone calls on Creon to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) arrested, warning him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) disease is catching. Creon relents. The Chorus protests. Haemon enters and begs his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) father to stop the guards. Creon replies that the mob already knows the truth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) can do nothing. Antigone sits before the First Guard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) cell; his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) is the last face she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) will see. The Guard rambles about his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) pay, rations, and professional quibbles. Antigone interrupts him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>), pointing out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) is soon to die. She (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) asks how she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) is to be executed. The Guard informs her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) is to be immured. The Guard asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) can do anything for her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) could give someone a letter, offering him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) ring. Reluctant to endanger his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) job, the Guard suggests that she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) dictate her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) letter and he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) write it in his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) notebook in case they search his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) pockets. Antigone winces but accepts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) recites her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) letter, <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, my darling. You would all have been so happy except for Antigone.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Suddenly a drum roll is heard, and the Guards lead Antigone out. The Chorus enters, announcing that it is Creon's turn. The Messenger delivers the news: Antigone had just been immured, when the crowd heard Haemon's moan from within. Creon howled for the slaves to remove the stones. Antigone had hung herself. Haemon then stabbed himself and lay beside Antigone in a pool of blood. Upon being told of Haemon's death, Eurydice finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) row of knitting, climbed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) room, and cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) throat. Creon is alone. The Chorus notes that truly if it had not been for Antigone, all would have been at peace. All who had to die have now died. Only the Guards are left, and the tragedy does not matter to them.
