They have come to exact revenge for the murder of Agamemnon, Orestes's father, as instructed by an oracle of Apollo. Electra, Orestes's sister, is heard sobbing within the house outside of which the three stand discussing how to execute their plan. Orestes wishes to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>), but instead the Old Man leads him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) away to present an offering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) father's grave, as Apollo's oracle has instructed. Electra emerges from inside the palace gates, pouring forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) grief in a mournful address to the heavens and praying to the deities to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) exact revenge for her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) father's death. The chorus, which is comprised of the virgins of the palace, attempt to console Electra, but Electra, bemoaning the oppression she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) suffers at her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) mother's hands, her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) deep sorrow at her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) father's death, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) longing for Orestes' return, proves inconsolable. Chrysothemis, Electra's younger sister, emerges from the palace with a funeral offering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) is unsurprised to find Electra mourning as usual outside the palace gates, and scolds her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) for it, urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) to get on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) warns Electra that Aegisthus, their mother, Clytemnestra's, husband, intends to lock her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) away in a secluded room unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) pulls herself together, to which threat Electra rolls her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) eyes. Chrysothemis then explains her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) purpose in carrying funeral offerings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) has been sent to make an offering at Agamemnon's grave by Clytemnestra, who is terrified by a dream she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) had the night before that Agamemnon, the husband she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) murdered, returned and planted his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) scepter in the floor of the house. The scepter grew branches from which leaves grew and overshadowed the land. Electra successfully convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) sister to throw away their mother's offering and instead to leave an offering of their own. Chrysothemis agrees and leaves to do so. Clytemnestra approaches with a servant who also carries an offering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) chastises Electra for mourning in the streets, and the two have an argument about Agamemnon's murder. Clytemnestra maintains that it was a just murder, done as revenge for Agamemnon's sacrifice of their daughter, Iphigenia. Electra holds that the sacrifice was necessary, and that, regardless of this detail, Clytemnestra murdered Agamemnon out of lust for Aegisthus. After this angry altercation, Clytemnestra, standing beside an altar, prays to Apollo for wealth, longevity, and, in guarded terms, for the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) son, Orestes, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might not return and disrupt her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) life. As soon as Clytemnestra has finished praying, the Old Man enters in the character of a Phocian, bearing a false account of Orestes's death. Clytemnestra is briefly touched by maternal feelings, yet delighted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) prayer has been answered; Electra is overcome with grief. Clytemnestra ushers the Old Man inside to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) hospitality. Chrysothemis returns from Agamemnon's grave, full of joy and sure that Orestes has returned, because at their father's grave she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) found a fresh offering of flowers and a lock of hair. Electra informs her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) sister that, to the contrary, Orestes is dead, and that is revenge is to be achieved, the sisters must take matters into their own hands. Chrysothemis rejects the idea as too risky, and leaves Electra to her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) grieving. Orestes then approaches with Pylades in the character of a Phocian, carrying an urn that, it is pretended, contains Orestes' ashes. Electra's despair is heightened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) takes the urn and laments over it at length. Orestes, visibly affected by the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sister's suffering, reveals himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), displaying their father's ring as proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) identity. Electra's grief is immediately replaced with joy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) is in the middle of celebrating when the Old Man emerges from within the palace and hurries Orestes inside to kill Clytemnestra. Electra remains outside, watching for Aegisthus so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) might not return unobserved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) listens excitedly to the sounds of Orestes killing Clytemnestra. Orestes, having successfully killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) mother, returns to Electra to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) the news, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) hurries back inside as they see Aegisthus approaching. Aegisthus asks Electra where the Phocians with news of Orestes's death have gone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) points inside the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) demands that the doors and gates of the palace be opened, so that the citizens can see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) thinks is Orestes's corpse. Orestes brings the corpse of Clytemnestra, covered with a sheet, to Aegisthus, and when the body is uncovered, Aegisthus realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) has been trapped and that death is upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>). Orestes orders Aegisthus inside so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) might kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) in the exact spot where, years before, Aegisthus killed Agamemnon.
