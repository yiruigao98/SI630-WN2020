They complain that <div class="bookquote">``they'' (<font color='red'><b>visitors</b></font>)</div>--that is, their visitors--are late. People can get away with anything these days. Mommy recounts her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) purchase of a hat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) was quite happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) new beige hat until meeting the chairwoman of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) woman's club, who insisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) hat was wheat. Mommy returned to the store and made a scene until given a new hat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) got <div class="bookquote">``satisfaction'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>. Grandma then enters with a load of neatly wrapped boxes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) dumps them at Daddy's feet and laments that the old cannot talk with anyone because they snap at them. They go deaf to avoid people talking to them in that way; ultimately, the way people talk to them causes their death. Mommy recalls that Grandma has always wrapped boxes nicely. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) was a child and poor, Grandma used to wrap her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) a lunchbox every day for school, and Mommy would never have the heart to rip into it. Grandma always filled it the night before with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) own un-eaten dinner. After school, Mommy would bring back her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) lunch for Grandma to eat. Now, having married Daddy, Mommy is rich. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) has earned the right to live off his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) money as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) used to let him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mount her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) and <div class="bookquote">``bump -LSB-his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)-RSB- uglies'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>. Grandma brings in more boxes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) calls Mommy a tramp: even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) was a girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) schemed to marry a rich man. The doorbell rings. Grandma asks who has come: is it the <div class="bookquote">``van people'' (<font color='red'><b>Grandma</b></font>)</div>? The bell rings again, and Daddy wrings his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in doubt--perhaps they should reconsider? Mommy insists that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind. At her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) prompting, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opens the door. <div class="bookquote">``WHAT a masculine daddy! Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) a masculine Daddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mommy jeers. Mrs. Barker now enters. Daddy invites Mrs. Barker to sit; Mommy offers her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) a cigarette, a drink, and the opportunity to cross her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) legs. Being a professional woman, Mrs. Barker opts for the latter. Mommy invites her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) to remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) dress; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) readily follows. Mrs. Barker asks if <div class="bookquote">``they''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barker</b></font>)</div>can assume Mommy and Daddy have invited them over the boxes. Silenced throughout the conversation, Grandma finally says her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) piece: the boxes have nothing to do with Mrs. Barker's visit. Mommy threatens to have Grandma taken away. The apartment has become over-crowded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) boxes. Grandma announces that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) knows why Mrs. Barker has come to visit. Mommy calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) a liar and commands Daddy to break her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) television. Mommy exits to fetch Mrs. Barker some water. Mrs. Barker implores Grandma to explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) visit. Grandma offers Mrs. Barker a hint. About twenty years ago, a man very much like Daddy and a woman very much like Mommy lived in an apartment very much like theirs with an old woman very much like Grandma. They contacted an organization very much like the nearby Bye-Bye Adoption Service and an adoption agent very much like Mrs. Barker, purchasing a <div class="bookquote">``bumble''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barker</b></font>)</div>of joy. Quickly they came upon trouble. The bumble cried its heart out. Then, it only had eyes for Daddy. Mommy gouged its eyes out, but then it kept its nose up in the air. Next, it developed an interest in its <div class="bookquote">``you-know-what'' (<font color='red'><b>parents</b></font>)</div>--its parents cut it off. When the bumble continued to look for its you-know-what, they chopped those off as well. Its tongue went when it called its Mommy a dirty name. Finally it died. Wanting satisfaction, its parents called the adoption agent back to the apartment to demand their money back. Mrs. Barker does not understand the relevance of Grandma's tale. Mulling the matter over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) leaves to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) water. The doorbell rings, and the Young Man enters. Grandma looks him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) over approvingly and compliments his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) looks: his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) face is <div class="bookquote">``almost insultingly good- looking in a typically American way'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>. Indeed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) himself notes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``type'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>. Grandma announces the boy as the American Dream. The Young Man reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) has come for work; he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) will do anything for money. Grandma reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) has put some money away herself. This year Grandma won $25000 in a baking contest under the pseudonym Uncle Henry and a store-bought cake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) dubbed the recipe Uncle Henry's Day-Old Cake. Grandma asks why he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would do anything for money. The Young Man replies that as someone who is incomplete, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) must compensate. His (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) mother died at his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) birth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) never knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) father. However, though without parents, the Man was not alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) womb, having an identical twin from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was separated from in their youth. In the passing years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) suffered countless losses: he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) eyes and the ability to see with pity and affection. An agony in his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) groin left him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) unable to love anyone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) has been left without feeling. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my child'' (<font color='red'><b>child murmurs Grandma</b></font>)</div>, murmurs Grandma in pity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) suspects the Young Man is the solution of Mommy and Daddy's dilemma. Mrs. Barker emerges and, Grandma announces the Young Man as the van man. Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) request, the Young Man takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) boxes outside. Grandma proposes the solution she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) has devised into Mrs. Barker's ear. The Young Man returns and reports that all the boxes are outside. Sadly, Grandma wonders why she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) bothers to take all the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) has accumulated over the years with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>). They exit to the elevator. Mrs. Barker, Mommy, and Daddy return, celebrating the resolution of their dilemma: they will get satisfaction after all. Suddenly Mommy exclaims that Grandma is missing. Mrs. Barker informs her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) that the van man claimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>). Near tears, Mommy replies that this is impossible: the van man is their invention. While Daddy comforts Mommy, Grandma emerges near the footlights. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) hushes the audience, declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) wants to watch the events to ensue. Motioning to Mrs. Barker, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) tiptoes to and opens the front door: the Young Man appears framed within. Pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) replacement, Mommy calls for a celebration. Grandma then interrupts the celebration and addresses the audience: we should leave things as they are while everyone has what they think they want. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) bids the audience good night.
