A man known simply as the American and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) girlfriend sit at a table outside the station, waiting for a train to Madrid. It is hot, and the man orders two beers. The girl remarks that the nearby hills look like white elephants, to which the American responds that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s never seen one. They order more drinks and begin to bicker about the taste of the alcohol. The American chastises her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and says that they should try to enjoy themselves. The girl replies that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s merely having fun and then retracts her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) earlier comment by saying the hills don't actually look like white elephants to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) anymore. They order more drinks, and the American mentions that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants the girl, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) calls <div class="bookquote">``Jig,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to have an operation, although he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never actually specifies what kind of operation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems agitated and tries to downplay the operation's seriousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) argues that the operation would be simple, for example, but then says the procedure really isn't even an operation at all. The girl says nothing for a while, but then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asks what will happen after she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s had the operation. The man answers that things will be fine afterward, just like they were before, and that it will fix their problems. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has known a lot of people who have had the operation and found happiness afterward. The girl dispassionately agrees with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The American then claims that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't force her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to have the operation but thinks it's the best course of action to take. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will have the operation as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll still love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and they'll be able to live happily together afterward. The man then emphasizes how much he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cares for the girl, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) claims not to care about what happens to herself. The American weakly says that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shouldn't have the operation if that's really the way she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feels. The girl then walks over to the end of the station, looks at the scenery, and wonders aloud whether they really could be happy if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has the operation. They argue for a while until the girl gets tired and makes the American promise to stop talking. The Spanish bartender brings two more beers and tells them that the train is coming in five minutes. The girl smiles at the bartender but has to ask the American what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said because the girl doesn't speak Spanish. After finishing their drinks, the American carries their bags to the platform and then walks back to the bar, noticing all the other people who are also waiting for the train. He (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) asks the girl whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feels better. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feels fine and that there is nothing wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
