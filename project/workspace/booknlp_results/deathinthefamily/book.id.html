They enjoy this time spent just between the two of them. On the way home, they stop by a pub so Jay can get a drink. After they return home, Rufus hears his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) father go out again. Much later that night, at almost three in the morning, the telephone rings. It is Ralph, Jay's alcoholic brother. Ralph tells Jay that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) had better come over soon because their father, Grampa Follet, has had another heart attack. Jay feels that the clearly drunk Ralph may be exaggerating. Nonetheless, Jay feels that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) cannot afford to risk it, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) sets off in the Ford early in the morning. After crossing a nearby river on the ferry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) feels that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) is driving into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) rural <div class="bookquote">``home country.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After Jay leaves, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) wife, Mary, has trouble sleeping. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) keeps thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) basic dislike of Jay's father, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) begins praying for God to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) strength to like the old man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) also asks God to help Jay become a religious man, as religion is something she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband feel differently about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feels religion is a rift between them in their marriage. In the morning, Mary tells the children that Jay has gone to see Grampa and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) will be back by nightfall. Meanwhile, Jay has arrived at the farm and is now angry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) made the trip: sure enough, Ralph greatly exaggerated their father's condition. The night before, Ralph kept sneaking out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) father's sickroom to take drinks; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) was a failure as a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) realized that nobody respects him (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) is a weak person. Hannah, Rufus's great-aunt, calls Mary and asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) can take Rufus shopping. After Rufus gets home from school, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) goes over to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) grandmother's house to meet Hannah. The two go shopping together, and the highlight of the trip for Rufus is when Hannah buys him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) a cap that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) desperately wants. At ten o'clock in the evening of the day that Jay is supposed to return home, Mary receives a phone call from a man who tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that Jay has been in an accident and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should send over a male member of the family. Mary immediately calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother, Andrew, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) and a family friend named Walter Starr drive out together. Before they leave, they drop off Aunt Hannah so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) can wait with Mary. The two women wait, tense and worried. Mary grows more and more alarmed as time passes. Joel and Catherine, Mary's parents, are also waiting in their own house. Joel calls Mary to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has heard any news, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has not. Joel is trying to read a magazine to distract him (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) from thinking about what might have happened to Jay, and Catherine is trying to do embroidery. Then Andrew returns to Mary's house. Mary guesses right away that Jay is dead, and Andrew confirms this fact. Shortly thereafter, Joel and Catherine arrive with Walter, who had gone directly to their house to get them. Joel takes Mary aside and gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) the best advice he (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) can on how to cope with the death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to stay strong, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) has confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Joel and Mary return to the living room, where Hannah, Catherine, and Andrew are all assembled. Andrew tells them all what happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) says that a cotter pin fell out of the steering mechanism of Jay's car, and that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) hit a rock in the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) lost control. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) head was thrown forward onto the steering wheel, causing a concussion that was instantly fatal and likely painless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) then was thrown clear of the car. They all drink some whiskey. Andrew calls Ralph to alert Jay's side of the family about the death. Ralph feels terrible, and offers to be the undertaker, but Mary has already brought Jay to a different undertaker. It occurs to Mary that Jay may have been drunk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) crashed the car; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) immediately tells herself, however, that Andrew would have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) if that was even a possibility, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) puts the thought out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head. Suddenly, Hannah, Mary, Andrew, and Catherine all sense a presence in the room. Mary says that it is Jay. When the presence returns, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feels that it is in the children's room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) goes upstairs to pray. Even Andrew, who is very skeptical about religion and all things supernatural, is shaken because he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) is sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) has sensed something. Mary comes downstairs again and asks Hannah to spend the night with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), which the older woman does. When Rufus wakes up the next morning, the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) wants to do is to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) father his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) new cap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) runs into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) parents' room, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) mother tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) to go get little Catherine, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) sister, because there is something she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has to tell both of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tells them that their father has died and that they will never be able to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again. The children are upset, but do not fully understand the import of the news. At breakfast, Hannah tells them the details of the death and says they can ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) questions about anything. That day, Rufus wanders around the house aimlessly, unsure of what to do with himself. Even though Hannah tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) to stay in the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) sneaks out and goes to the sidewalk where kids walk to school. A bunch of them gather around him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) tells them that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) father is dead. One little boy relates the story as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) read it in the local newspaper, adding gory details. Another boy says that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father said that Jay was drunk. Then the school bell rings, the boys run off, and Rufus goes home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) gets in an argument with little Catherine over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) coloring book, and Aunt Hannah chastises him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>). The next day, Hannah washes and dresses Rufus and little Catherine for the funeral. A priest named Father Jackson comes to the house and, after meanly reprimanding the children for staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>), goes into Mary's room and prays with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and Hannah. The children eavesdrop at the door until Walter Starr arrives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Starr</b></font>) keeps them company in the sitting room until their mother and aunt emerge with Father Jackson. The children go to the wake, which is held at their grandparents' house, and see their father for the last time. Back at home, little Catherine feels lonely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looks for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother and hides under a bed until Mary finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Andrew takes Rufus for a walk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) tells Rufus about a beautiful butterfly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) saw land on their father's coffin during the burial service. The story makes Rufus feel better about not being present at the funeral. Then Andrew gets angry with Father Jackson and tells Rufus that the priest refused to read the full burial service because Jay had never been baptized. As Rufus and Andrew walk home in silence, Rufus wonders if, since Andrew hates religion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) also hates the religious Mary and Hannah.
