The
afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is expected home at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) term at the mission school, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does
not arrive. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dislikes taking the bus and then walking the rest of the way through
the countryside to the family's homestead. Tambu is relieved at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) absence, as she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>)
does not have to kill and prepare a chicken to celebrate his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) return. Tambu then reflects on the events leading up to her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) brother's death. Despite
the family's poverty, Tambu's parents were able to raise the fees to send Nhamo to
school. There was not enough money to send Tambu as well, so she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) decided to grow and
sell vegetables and raise the money herself. When she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) discovered that her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) brother
was stealing food from her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) garden patch, she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) attempted to beat him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) up while the two
were attending Sunday school. Tambu's teacher, Mr. Matimba, took her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) to Umtali, a
local urban center, to sell green ears of corn. A white woman, Doris, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Doris</b></font>)
husband pitied Tambu and gave Mr. Matimba ten pounds sterling to pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>Doris</b></font>)
education. The extended family gathered to celebrate the return of Babamukuru, his (<font color='blue'><b>Matimba</b></font>) wife,
Maiguru, and their two children, Chido and Nyasha, back from studying abroad in
England. Chido and Nyasha, Tambu's cousins, had lost the ability to speak their
native tongue, Shona. Maiguru did not want them participating in the dancing and
other festive activities. At the end of the meal, Tambu was ordered to bring a bowl
of water to each member of the extended family so they could wash their hands.
Babamukuru's three siblings praised his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) success. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) proposed educating a member of
each family, focusing especially on the neediest branch, Tambu's clan. They chose
Nhamo to go to the mission school, but after his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) sudden death, Tambu is selected to
replace him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>). Tambu, returning her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) focus to the present, is excited and awed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) new life
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) aunt and uncle's house on the mission school grounds. Maiguru warmly welcomes
Tambu into her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) new home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) serves Tambu tea and pastries and gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) an entirely
new wardrobe, all in preparation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) first day of school. The coldness and
emotional distance that once existed between Nyasha and Tambu quickly disappear.
Tambu becomes absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) studies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) soon learns the rhythms of
the household, witnessing Nyasha and Babamukuru's frequent fights. She (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>)
also learns that Maiguru is highly educated. To mark the end of the term, Nyasha, Tambu, and the children of white
missionaries attend a dance. Tambu reluctantly joins the festivities. At the end of
the evening, Nyasha resists coming inside, still trying to master a new dance one of
the boys is teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>). When the young people finally enter the house, a violent
argument erupts between Babamukuru and Nyasha, in which Babamukuru accuses Nyasha of
lewd behavior. Nyasha strikes her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) father, who vows to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) for performing the
taboo act of assaulting her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) own parent. Nyasha grows more detached in the following
weeks, and Tambu tries to help assuage her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) guilt. During the school vacation, Tambu and her (<font color='blue'><b>Shona</b></font>) relatives head back to the
homestead. Maiguru laments the fact that, as senior wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is expected to cook
and clean for the extended family the entire time. Babamukuru is upset to find
Lucia, Tambu's mother's sister, and Takesure, a relative of Tambu's father, still
living at the homestead. To make matters worse, Lucia is pregnant with Takesure's
child. A family meeting is held to decide what course of action should be taken.
Ultimately the couple is allowed to remain, as Babamukuru shifts his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucia</b></font>) focus to
another moral issue that rankles him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucia</b></font>): his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucia</b></font>) own brother's unsanctified domestic
status. Babamukuru declares that Jeremiah and Ma'Shingayi must be married in a
formal Christian ceremony as soon as possible. Tambu's mother comes to the mission hospital and gives birth to a son. Lucia
soon follows and asks Babamukuru to find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a job, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucia</b></font>) does. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cooks at the
school and begins taking classes. Preparations are being made for the impending
nuptials. When it comes time to leave, Tambu, who is vehemently opposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
parents' wedding, feigns illness. When Babamukuru tells her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to be ready in thirty
minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) refuses to attend. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucia</b></font>) returns from the wedding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucia</b></font>) punishes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by
lashing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to perform the maid's duties for two weeks. Maiguru
argues with Babamukuru over the lack of respect that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gets and the fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
economic contribution to the family is not recognized. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) leaves the next day and
stays with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, Chido. While the girls are preparing for final exams, nuns arrive at the mission and
administer a test. Tambu is offered a scholarship to study at the esteemed mission
school. At first, Babamukuru is opposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) accepting the offer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
eventually relents. Home for the holiday, Tambu finds her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother ill. Lucia arrives
and nurses her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sister back to health. When Tambu returns to the mission and prepares
to leave for the convent school, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cannot find Nyasha anywhere. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) finally
finds Nyasha, Nyasha is cold toward her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), upset that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) best friend will soon be
leaving and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will be left alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unsympathetic father. Tambu leaves for the convent school, where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shares a crowded room with
other African girls. Busy with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) studies, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soon falls out of touch with Nyasha.
Tambu returns to the mission to find Nyasha changed, frightfully thin and suffering
from a severe eating disorder. One night, Nyasha has what appears to be a psychotic
episode. Nyasha sees a psychiatrist and slowly regains her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) health. Tambu fears she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
is succumbing to the negative, colonial influence that made Nyasha mentally ill. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
other cousin, Chido, has a white girlfriend, much to Maiguru's chagrin. Tambu
declares her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) intention to begin questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) world and the influences that it
exerts on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
