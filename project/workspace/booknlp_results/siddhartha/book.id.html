of a Brahmin, lives with his father in ancient India. Everyone in
the village expects Siddhartha to be a successful Brahmin like his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)
father. Siddhartha enjoys a near-idyllic existence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) best friend,
Govinda, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is secretly dissatisfied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) performs all the rituals
of religion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) does what religion says should bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) happiness
and peace. Nonetheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) feels something is missing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father
and the other elders have still not achieved enlightenment, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) feels that staying with them will not settle the questions he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)
has about the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) existence. Siddhartha believes his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father
has already passed on all the wisdom their community has to offer,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) longs for something more. One day, a group of wandering ascetics called Samanas
passes through town. They are starved and almost naked and have
come to beg for food. They believe enlightenment can be reached
through asceticism, a rejection of the body and physical desire.
The path the Samanas preach is quite different from the one Siddhartha
has been taught, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) believes it may provide some of the answers
he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is looking for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) decides to follow this new path. Siddhartha's
father does not want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to join the Samanas, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cannot dissuade
Siddhartha. Govinda also wants to find a path to enlightenment,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) joins Siddhartha in this new life. Siddhartha adjusts quickly to the ways of the Samanas
because of the patience and discipline he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learned in the Brahmin
tradition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learns how to free himself from the traditional trappings
of life, and so loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) desire for property, clothing, sexuality,
and all sustenance except that required to live. His (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) goal is to
find enlightenment by eliminating his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) Self, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) successfully
renounces the pleasures of the world. Sunburned and half-starved, Siddhartha soon ceases to
resemble the boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) used to be. Govinda is quick to praise the Samanas
and notes the considerable moral and spiritual improvements they
both have achieved since joining. Siddhartha, however, is still
dissatisfied. The path of self-denial does not provide a permanent
solution for him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) points out that the oldest Samanas have lived
the life for many years but have yet to attain true spiritual enlightenment.
The Samanas have been as unsuccessful as the Brahmins Siddhartha
and Govinda left behind. At this time, Siddhartha and the other Samanas
begin to hear about a new holy man named Gotama the Buddha who has
attained the total spiritual enlightenment called Nirvana. Govinda
convinces Siddhartha they both should leave the Samanas and seek
out Gotama. Siddhartha and Govinda inform the leader of the Samanas
of their decision to leave. The leader is clearly displeased, but
Siddhartha silences him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) with an almost magical, hypnotizing gaze. Siddhartha and Govinda find Gotama's camp of followers
and are taken in. Siddhartha is initially pleased with Gotama, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) and Govinda are instructed in the Eightfold Path, the four main
points, and other aspects of Buddhism. However, while Govinda is
convinced to join Gotama and his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) followers, Siddhartha still has doubts.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has noticed a contradiction in Gotama's teachings: Siddhartha
questions how one can embrace the unity of all things, as the Buddha
asks, if they are also being told to overcome the physical world.
Siddhartha realizes Buddhism will not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) the answers he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) needs.
Sadly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) leaves Govinda behind and begins a search for the meaning
of life, the achievement of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) feels will not be dependent
on religious instruction. Siddhartha decides to embark on a life free from meditation
and the spiritual quests he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has been pursuing, and to instead learn
from the pleasures of the body and the material world. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) new
wanderings, Siddhartha meets a friendly ferryman, fully content
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) simple life. Siddhartha crosses the ferryman's river and
comes to a city. Here, a beautiful courtesan named Kamala entrances
him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) would be the best one to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) about the world
of love, but Kamala will not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) proves he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) can fit
into the material world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to take up the path of
the merchant. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) help, Siddhartha soon finds employment with
a merchant named Kamaswami and begins to learn the trade. While Siddhartha
learns the wisdom of the business world and begins to master the
skills Kamaswami teaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), Kamala becomes his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) lover and teaches
him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) knows about love. Years pass, and Siddhartha's business acumen increases.
Soon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is a rich man and enjoys the benefits of an affluent life.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) gambles, drinks, and dances, and anything that can be bought
in the material world is his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) for the taking. Siddhartha is detached
from this life, however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) can never see it as more than a
game. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) doesn't care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wins or loses this game because it doesn't
touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spirit in any lasting way. The more he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) obtains in the
material world, the less it satisfies him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is soon caught
in a cycle of unhappiness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) tries to escape by engaging in
even more gambling, drinking, and sex. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) most disillusioned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) dreams that Kamala's rare songbird is
dead in its cage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) understands that the material world is slowly
killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) without providing him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) with the enlightenment for which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has been searching. One night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) resolves to leave it all behind
and departs without notifying either Kamala or Kamaswami. Sick at heart, Siddhartha wanders until he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) finds a river.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) considers drowning himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) instead falls asleep on the
riverbank. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is sleeping, Govinda, who is now a Buddhist
monk, passes by. Not recognizing Siddhartha, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) watches over the
sleeping man to protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) from snakes. Siddhartha immediately
recognizes Govinda when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wakes up, but Govinda notes that Siddhartha
has changed significantly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) days with the Samanas and now appears
to be a rich man. Siddhartha responds that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is currently neither
a Samana nor a rich man. Siddhartha wishes to become someone new.
Govinda soon leaves to continue on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) journey, and Siddhartha sits
by the river and considers where his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life has taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). Siddhartha seeks out the same content ferryman he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) met
years before. The ferryman, who introduces himself as Vasudeva,
radiates an inner peace that Siddhartha wishes to attain. Vasudeva
says he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) himself has attained this sense of peace through many years
of studying the river. Siddhartha expresses a desire to likewise
learn from the river, and Vasudeva agrees to let Siddhartha live
and work beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). Siddhartha studies the river and begins to
take from it a spiritual enlightenment unlike any he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has ever known.
While sitting by the river, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) contemplates the unity of all life,
and in the river's voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hears the wordOm. One day Kamala the courtesan approaches the ferry along
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) son on a pilgrimage to visit Gotama, who is said to be
dying. Before they can cross, a snake bites Kamala. Siddhartha and Vasudeva
tend to Kamala, but the bite kills her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>). Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) dies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) tells
Siddhartha that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is the father of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) eleven-year-old son. Siddhartha
does his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) best to console and provide for his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son, but the boy is
spoiled and cynical. Siddhartha's son dislikes life with the two
ferrymen and wishes to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) familiar city and wealth. Vasudeva
believes Siddhartha's son should be allowed to leave if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wants
to, but Siddhartha is not ready to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) go. One morning, Siddhartha
awakens to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son has run away and stolen all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) and Vasudeva's
money. Siddhartha chases after the boy, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) reaches the city
he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) realizes the chase is futile. Vasudeva follows Siddhartha and
brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) back to their home by the river, instructing him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to soothe
the pain of losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son by listening to the river. Siddhartha studies the river for many years, and Vasudeva teaches
Siddhartha how to learn the many secrets the river has to tell.
In contemplating the river, Siddhartha has a revelation: Just as the
water of the river flows into the ocean and is returned by rain,
all forms of life are interconnected in a cycle without beginning
or end. Birth and death are all part of a timeless unity. Life and
death, joy and sorrow, good and evil are all parts of the whole
and are necessary to understand the meaning of life. By the time
Siddhartha has learned all the river's lessons, Vasudeva announces
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is through with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life at the river. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) retires into the
forest, leaving Siddhartha to be the ferryman. The novel ends with Govinda returning to the river to
seek enlightenment by meeting with a wise man who lives there. When Govinda
arrives, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) does not recognize that the wise man is Siddhartha himself.
Govinda is still a follower of Gotama but has yet to attain the
kind of enlightenment that Siddhartha now radiates, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) asks
Siddhartha to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knows. Siddhartha explains that
neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) nor anyone can teach the wisdom to Govinda, because verbal
explanations are limited and can never communicate the entirety
of enlightenment. Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) asks Govinda to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>)
on the forehead, and when Govinda does, the vision of unity that
Siddhartha has experienced is communicated instantly to Govinda.
Govinda and Siddhartha have both finally achieved the enlightenment
they set out to find in the days of their youth.
