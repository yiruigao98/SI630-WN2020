and family ties, but at the age of 29, she
is still not married. Since the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) mother, who had an
intense hatred for <div class="bookquote">``dinginess,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Lily began to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) aunt,
Mrs. Peniston. However, Lily spends much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) time staying at
the Bellomont, the out-of-town estate of the wealthy and well-establish
Gus and Judy Trenor. At the Bellomont, Judy regularly throws extravagant
parties that are attended by most of the New York upper-crust. They
play bridge for money, which is problematic for Lily because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
has a gambling addiction and cannot stop gambling, even though it
ruins her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) financially. Lily has two main goals in the book: marriage and wealth.
It is her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) hope to marry a rich man, thereby securing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) place in
society, but due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) own indecision, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) passes up numerous chances, always
thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) can do better. Unfortunately, Lily's true love, Lawrence
Selden, does not have enough money for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>). Lily hears about the stock market at the Bellomont and
decides that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) would like to get involved in investment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) asks
Gus Trenor to invest her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) small sum of money for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) readily assents
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) is secretly attracted to Lily and wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) to spend
time with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>). The investments pay off, and as Lily begins to make
money from Wall Street, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) begins to spend lavishly. Later, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
horror, Trenor tries to proposition her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) learns that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>)
has not been investing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) money--of which there is none--but rather his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>)
own; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) has been giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) profits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) may pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>)
back by spending time with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>), but Lily withdraws quickly from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) presence and resolves that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) will somehow pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) back, although
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) does not know how. Lily takes a sudden vacation to the Mediterranean with
George and Bertha Dorset and the young Ned Silverton, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) soon
learns that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) is being brought along to distract George while
Bertha has an affair with Ned. When Lily begins to associate with
European royalty, Bertha becomes jealous and kicks her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) off the cruise
yacht, starting a nasty rumor that Lily and George are having an
affair, which leads to Lily's expulsion from society. Lily returns
to America to learn that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) aunt has died, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) with only
$10,000, which
is just enough to pay off her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) debt to Trenor, although Lily cannot
have the money until one year has elapsed. In the meantime, Lily tries
desperately to rebuild her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) reputation in society, but fails and moves
in with Gerty Farish, Selden's cousin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) takes up jobs as a secretary
and milliner -LRB-hat maker-RRB- before finally moving into a boarding house
and leading a meaningless life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) begins to take sleeping pills
to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) get away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) fear and loneliness until the day
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) check from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) aunt's estate finally arrives. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) pays
off all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) debts with the money, then overdoses -LRB-perhaps intentionally-RRB-
on sleeping pills. The next day, Selden shows up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) apartment
with the intention of proposing marriage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>), only to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
dead, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) debts paid off.
