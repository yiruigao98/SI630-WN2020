Arthur Birling has convened a dinner for the engagement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) daughter, Sheila, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) boyfriend, Gerald Croft. Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wife Sybil seem happy, although Sybil is reserved at the meal. Eric, Sheila's brother, drinks heavily and appears mildly upset. Gerald gives Sheila her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) ring, and Sheila and Sybil leave the room to try on wedding clothes. Eric goes upstairs. Arthur tells Gerald he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knows the Croft family considers themselves social superiors of the Birlings, but that's easily remedied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) says, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) expects a knighthood for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) business successes. Gerald promises to relay the news to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) mother. Eric returns, and Arthur gives the two young men advice about professional life, saying that people ought to look out for themselves and their families, and not fall prey to socialist propaganda about the collective good. Edna, the maid, announces that an Inspector Goole is here to speak to Arthur. The Inspector, whom Arthur does not know despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) positions in local government, announces that a girl named Eva Smith has died of an apparent suicide. The Inspector asks Arthur if he (<font color='blue'><b>Inspector</b></font>) knows anyone by that name. Arthur initially denies it, but after seeing a picture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) admits to employing Eva at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) factory, and firing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) incites a failed strike for higher wages. Arthur says he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is not sorry for doing so, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is sad to hear of the girl's death. Arthur believes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) foremost obligation is to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) profits. When Sheila returns to the room, the Inspector begins interrogating her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>). It is revealed that Sheila got a girl fired from Milward's, a local shop, for giving Sheila mean looks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) was trying on clothing. Sheila regrets to hear that the person she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) incriminated was none other than Eva Smith, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) and Arthur are responsible, in part, for Eva's poverty and suicide. The Inspector turns to Gerald and asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>Inspector</b></font>) knows someone named Daisy Renton. Sheila realizes, from Gerald's expression, that Gerald knows this name. When all but Sheila and Gerald leave the room, Sheila accuses Gerald of having had an affair with Daisy Renton the previous summer. Gerald admits to this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) asks Sheila to hide this information from the Inspector, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) says it won't be possible because the Inspector probably already knows. Act One ends. Act Two begins with the same set. The Inspector questions Gerald about Daisy Renton, and Gerald admits to the affair in front of Sheila and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) parents, Arthur and Sybil. Gerald is embarrassed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) indiscretion, but insists his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) concern for Daisy was authentic. Sheila wonders if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) can forgive Gerald enough to continue their relationship. Gerald tells the Inspector he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) is going to leave for a walk. The Inspector moves on to Sybil, who, on being questioned, says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>), as director of a charity, refused assistance to a pregnant woman. The Inspector tells them that the girl Sybil turned away was Eva Smith, or, as Gerald knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>), Daisy Renton. The Inspector also says that Gerald was not the one who got Eva pregnant. Sybil says she (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) feels no regret, as Eva/Daisy had claimed she (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) was pregnant but was not married to the child's father. To this, Sybil responded that Eva/Daisy should ask the child's father for money. Sybil blames the unnamed father for the situation, and for Eva/Daisy's suicide. Sheila and Arthur tell Sybil to stop talking. In this moment, Sybil realizes that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) son, Eric, must be the father of the child, since Eva/Daisy presented herself to the charity as <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Birling.''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>Eric returns to the room. Act Two ends. In Act Three, with the same set, Eric admits to an affair with Eva/Daisy, and to a drinking problem that makes many of the details hazy. The Inspector demonstrates that each member of the Birling family, and Gerald, has played a part in Eva/Daisy's suicide, and that all should consider themselves guilty. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) leaves, the Inspector says that people must look out for one another, and that society is <div class="bookquote">``one body.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>The Inspector departs. Sheila, wracked with guilt, wonders aloud whether the Inspector is a member of the police force. The family puzzles this out, and when Gerald returns, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) spoke to a sergeant outside who does not know of any Inspector with the name of Goole, the man who just visited the Birling home. Arthur believes that the family has been hoaxed, and that this is a good thing, since their misdeeds will not now result in public scandal. Sheila resents Arthur's rationalization of the family's behavior, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) says they are still guilty for Eva/Daisy's death, even if the Inspector was not a genuine officer. Gerald, however, notes that no family member saw the picture of Eva/Daisy at the same time, and that the Inspector might have conflated the family's stories by offering pictures of different women, and changing the names from Eva Smith to Daisy Renton. Sheila wonders whether this would excuse everyone's behavior, but it does not, as Gerald still committed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) affair, Eric impregnated an unmarried girl, and Arthur and Sybil behaved uncharitably to young girls in need. Arthur calls the hospital and confirms that no self-inflicted deaths have been recorded for weeks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) says resolutely that Inspector Goole has tricked the family and that there is nothing to fear. Sheila worries aloud that Arthur will ignore the lessons the family was just beginning to learn. The phone rings, and Arthur answers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) alerts the family that a girl has been admitted to the hospital just now, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) death is a suicide. As the play ends, Arthur relays to the family that a police inspector is headed to the house to begin an inquiry.
