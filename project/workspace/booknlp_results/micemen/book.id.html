and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California
farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with
<div class="bookquote">``sharp, strong features.''  (<font color='red'><b>George a man</b></font>)</div>Lennie, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) companion, is his (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) opposite,
a giant of a man with a <div class="bookquote">``shapeless''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>face. Overcome with thirst,
the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the
night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has a mild
mental disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie,
who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them,
has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it
away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal.
George complains loudly that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life would be easier without having
to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship
and devotion is mutual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) and Lennie share a dream of buying their
own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie's delight, keeping
rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>)
often tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) about what life will be like in such an idyllic
place. The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George,
fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>)'ll do
all the talking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) lies, explaining that they travel together because
they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old <div class="bookquote">``swamper,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Candy swamper</b></font>)</div>or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley,
the boss's mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Curley</b></font>) flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George
and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley's wife appears and
flirts with them. Lennie thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``purty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but George, sensing
the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Soon, the ranch-hands
return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim,
the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch.
Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George
and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim's
dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and
shoot Candy's old, good-for-nothing dog. The next day, George confides in Slim that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and Lennie
are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) tells
how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they
were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch
a woman's dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would
be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson,
before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly. Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and
Curley, who is maniacally searching for his (<font color='blue'><b>Curley</b></font>) wife, heads to the barn
to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their
plans to buy land, and offers his (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) life's savings if they will let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know
of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Curley</b></font>) suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his (<font color='blue'><b>Curley</b></font>) anger,
finds Lennie and picks a fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>). Lennie crushes Curley's
hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) tries to get
George and Lennie fired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) will be the laughingstock of the farm. The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel.
Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, black stable-hand, and Candy.
Curley's wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other
men come home. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) notices the cuts on Lennie's face and suspects
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>), and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible
for hurting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. This thought amuses her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The next day,
Lennie accidentally kills his (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) puppy in the barn. Curley's wife enters
and consoles him (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and
wishes that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dream of becoming a movie star.
Lennie tells her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) loves petting soft things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) offers to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) feel her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) grabs too tightly, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cries out.
In his (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) attempt to silence her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) accidentally breaks her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) neck. Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that
George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get
into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened
and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to
Lennie's surprise, George is not mad at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) for doing <div class="bookquote">``a bad thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>George
begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of
the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend
in the back of the head. When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that
Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>) and shot
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lennie</b></font>). Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George
has killed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) away,
and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave.
