town of King's Lynn. After the birth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynn</b></font>) first child, Margery has a nervous
breakdown, seeing hideous devils all around her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>). Margery recovers after having a
vision of Jesus Christ, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) decides to devote her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) life to holiness and
contemplation of God. One of the first hurdles Margery has to overcome is convincing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) husband to live a life of celibacy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) succeeds only after having
fourteen children. After the failure of a brewing business she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) starts, Margery
becomes certain that God wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) to turn away from the world. Margery's devotion
to Jesus is highly emotional and dramatic, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) soon acquires a reputation as a
religious eccentric, a potentially dangerous reputation in a time when heresy was a
capital offense. Margery faces doubt and temptation, especially sexual temptation,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) perseveres and often receives guidance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) visions. Margery makes several pilgrimages, the longest and most difficult of which is
a journey to Jerusalem, with a long stopover in Rome. During the pilgrimage, Margery
is shunned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) fellow travelers but is often accepted by the poor, a pattern that
repeats itself throughout her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) life. In Jerusalem, Margery has several intense
visions, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) begins to have spells in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) sobs and cries uncontrollably.
These crying fits come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) most often during religious services, but they also
occur whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) simply thinks of Jesus or sees something that reminds her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)
suffering. Margery is stranded in Rome for a time after giving away her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) money to the
poor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) way by begging. Margery's extreme behavior begins to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) notorious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) makes enemies among the English contingent in Rome.
Eventually, Margery is given enough money to return home. Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) return to England, Margery does her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) best to live a life of devotion
to Christ. As a married woman, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) is somewhat constrained, such as by the
fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) cannot become a nun. Margery travels to various churches and holy
sites in England, attracting attention wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) goes, thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) public
weeping and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) all-white wardrobe. At times, Margery is accepted as a holy woman,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) advice and blessings are solicited. More often, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) is treated as an oddity
or a nuisance and mocked. On occasion, the hostile attention she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) draws goes beyond
mockery. Traveling through the north of England, Margery is arrested several times
and almost burned at the stake as a heretic, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) is saved by the intervention
of the church authorities. Each time she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) is arrested, Margery defends herself
vigorously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) is respectful to authority but firm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) beliefs, none of which
are heretical, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) examiners soon see. Margery continues to have mystical visions of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and
several saints. Margery's devotion to Christ is particularly intense and is
expressed in highly physical, even sexual, terms. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) visions, Margery often sees
herself as a servant to Mary or Jesus, acting as an eyewitness to the events of the
gospels. Jesus speaks to Margery in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) visions of such subjects as the Trinity, the
salvation and damnation of souls, and the meaning of the constant tears he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) sends
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>). Margery tries to spend as much time as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) can in prayer or in conversation
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) spiritual guides. Even so, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) dramatic weeping in church and elsewhere
continues to draw attention and, often, censure. Margery comes into particular
conflict with a friar who moves to Lynn and refuses to allow Margery to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
preach because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) disruptive weeping. As time goes on, Margery's husband becomes old and infirm, and Margery returns
to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) household to care for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). One of Margery's sons turns from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sinful ways
after much praying and beseeching by Margery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) marries a German woman. The
couple comes to England for a visit, and the son takes ill and dies, soon followed
by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) last extended journey, Margery accompanies her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) daughter-in-law
-LRB-who is less than enthusiastic about being joined by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) odd mother-in-law-RRB- back to
Germany, only deciding to leave at the last minute. Margery's trip overland from
Germany to France is her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) most grueling yet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) is again scorned by other
travelers from England, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) turns for help. Eventually, Margery makes it to
London and finally back to Lynn. Home once again, Margery, now an old woman, decides
to record the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) life and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) devotions, and begins the dictation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>)
Book.
