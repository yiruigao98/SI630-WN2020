The narrative structure intersperses descriptions of present action with thoughts and conversations that offer glimpses of past events and occurrences. Though there is no single narrator, the story is alternatively seen from the point of view of each of the main characters. The novel opens with Hana, a young nurse, gardening outside a villa in Italy in 1945. The European theater of the war has just ended with the Germans retreating up the Italian countryside. As the Germans retreated, they left hidden bombs and mines everywhere, so the landscape is particularly dangerous. Although the other nurses and patients have left the villa to escape to a safer place, Hana decides to stay in the villa with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) patient. Hana does not know much about the man for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) cares. Found in the wreckage of a plane crash, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been burned beyond recognition, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole body black and even the slightest touch painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talks about the Bedouin tribe who found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the wreckage, cared for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wounds, and eventually returned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to a British camp in 1944. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not know who they were, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels grateful to them nonetheless. To pass the time, Hana reads to the English patient--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) assumes he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) is English by his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) manner and speech--and also gardens, fixes up the villa, and plays hopscotch. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) picks up the patient's notebook, a copy of Herodotus's The Histories marked throughout with his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) own notes, figures, and observations, and reads to him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) or to herself. One day, a man with bandaged hands named Caravaggio arrives at the villa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) is an old family friend of Hana's father, Patrick, and had heard about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) location while he (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) was recovering in a hospital a few miles away. In Canada, where Caravaggio knew Hana years ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) was a thief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) how his (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) skills were legitimized in the war and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) put them to use working for British Intelligence in North Africa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) that the Germans caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) after an attempt to steal a camera from a woman's room. They tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) and cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) thumbs, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) hands mutilated and nearly useless. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) has recovered somewhat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) is still addicted to morphine. In the villa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caravaggio</b></font>) reminisces with Hana and mourns with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) over the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) father in the war. As Hana plays the piano in the library, two soldiers come in and stand alongside while she (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) plays. One of them is Kip, an Indian Sikh trained as a sapper, or bomb-defuser, in the British army. After hearing the piano, Kip has come to clear the villa of bombs, knowing that the Germans frequently booby-trapped musical instruments. Kip and the English patient get along very well, as they are both experts in guns and bombs and enjoy talking to each other and sharing stories. Kip makes camp in the garden of the villa and becomes a part of the <div class="bookquote">``family''  (<font color='red'><b>Kip</b></font>)</div>that now exists there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) goes off into town every day to clear more bombs from the area and to bury fellow sappers who have died. Kip's job is extremely dangerous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) feels a strong attraction to Hana, and soon they become lovers. Asked about his (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) past, the English patient begins to tell the others his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) story. His (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) real name is Almasy, though this is not definitively confirmed until Chapter IX. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) spent the years from 1930 to the start of World War II exploring the North African desert. His (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) job was to make observations, draw maps, and search for ancient oases in the sands. Along with his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) fellow European counterparts, Almasy knew every inch of the desert and made many trips across it. In 1936, a young man from Oxford, Geoffrey Clifton, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) new wife Katharine, joined their party. Geoffrey owned a plane, which the party found especially useful in helping to map the desert. The explorers, Almasy, and the Cliftons got along very well. One night, after hearing Katharine read a passage from his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) book of Herodotus, Almasy realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) was in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>). They soon began a torrid and tumultuous affair. Everywhere they stole glances and moments, and they were obsessed with each other. Finally, in 1938, Katharine broke off their affair, telling Almasy that Geoffrey would go mad if he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) ever found out. Although their affair was over, Almasy remained haunted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) tried to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) for hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) by being particularly mean to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) in public. At some point, Geoffrey somehow found out about the affair. World War II broke out in 1939, and Almasy decided to close up their camp and arranged for Geoffrey to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) up in the desert. Geoffrey arrived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) plane with Katharine. Geoffrey attempted to kill all three of them by crashing the plane into Almasy, who was standing on the ground. The plane missed Almasy, but the crash killed Geoffrey, left Katharine severely injured, and left them with no way to escape the desert. Almasy placed Katharine in a nearby cave, covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) with a parachute for warmth, and promised to come back for her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) walked across the desert for four days until he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) reached the nearest town, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) got there, the English army would not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) get back to Katharine. Because Almasy had a foreign-sounding name, the British were suspicious and locked him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) up as a spy, prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) from saving Katharine. Almasy was eventually released, but he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) knew it was too late to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) worked for the Germans, helping their spies make their way across the desert into Cairo. After he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) left Cairo, his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) truck broke down in the desert. Without transportation, he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) walked to the cave to get Katharine. He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) dead body and placed it in a plane that had been buried beneath the sand. The plane malfunctioned during their flight and caught fire. Almasy parachuted down from the plane, his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) body covered in flames. That was the point at which the Bedouins found him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) and cared for his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) burns. Little by little, the English patient tells this whole story. Caravaggio, who has suspected the English patient was not really English, has his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) suspicions confirmed. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) fills in gaps for the Almasy, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) that Geoffrey Clifton was really an agent of British Intelligence and that Intelligence had known about Almasy and Katharine's affair the whole time. They knew Almasy had started helping the Germans and planned to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) in the desert. They lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) between Cairo and the plane crash, and now, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) is unrecognizable. The focus of the novel shifts to Kip, and we are told his (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) entire story. Although Kip's brother always distrusted the west, Kip went willingly to serve in the British army. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) was trained as a bomb defuser under Lord Suffolk, a true English gentleman, and was then virtually welcomed into an English family. Kip soon grew quite skillful at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) job, able to figure out both the <div class="bookquote">``joke''  (<font color='red'><b>Kip</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``character''  (<font color='red'><b>Kip</b></font>)</div>of each bomb he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) tackled. Lord Suffolk and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) group were blown up defusing a bomb, and Kip decided to leave England and become a sapper in Italy. Kip has felt emotionally removed from everyone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) job as a sapper. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) meets Hana, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) uses her (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) to once again connect to humanity. All the residents of the villa celebrate Hana's twenty-first birthday, and Kip grows comfortable as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hana</b></font>) lover. When August comes, however, Kip hears on the radio of the atomic bomb that the United States has dropped on Japan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) becomes enraged, knowing that a western country would never commit such an atrocity against another white country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) gun and threatens to kill the English patient, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) sees as a symbol of the West. Kip does not kill Almasy, but takes off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) motorcycle, leaving the villa forever. Years later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) is a doctor in India with a family of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) own. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) is happy and fulfilled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) new life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kip</b></font>) often wonders about Hana.
