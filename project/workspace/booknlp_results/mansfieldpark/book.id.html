Fanny's family is quite poor; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) mother, unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sister Lady Bertram, married beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), and Fanny's father, a sailor, is disabled and drinks heavily. Fanny is abused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) other aunt, Mrs. Norris, a busybody who runs things at Mansfield Park, the Bertrams' estate. The Bertram daughters, Maria and Julia, are shallow, rather cruel girls, intent on marrying well and being fashionable. The elder son, Tom, is a roustabout and a drunk. Fanny finds solace only in the friendship of the younger son, Edmund, who is planning to be a clergyman. Fanny grows up shy and deferential, caught as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) typically is between members of the Bertram family. Sir Thomas leaves Mansfield Park for Antigua, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) owns plantations. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) absence, two new figures arrive at Mansfield: Henry and Mary Crawford, the brother and sister of the local minister's wife. Henry and Mary are attractive and cheerful, and they soon become indispensable members of the Mansfield circle. Henry flirts extensively with Maria, who is engaged to marry the boring but wealthy Rushworth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) also flirts with Julia when it suits his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) purposes. At first, Mary is interested in Tom, the older son and heir, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) soon realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is boring and not really interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) finds herself increasingly attracted to Edmund, although the prospect of marrying a clergyman does not appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is often cruel to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) on this account. In the meantime, Fanny has innocently fallen in love with Edmund, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not even admit this to herself. Yates, a visiting friend of Tom's, proposes that the group should put on a play. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) idea is eagerly received by all except for Edmund and Fanny, who are horrified at the idea of acting. The play goes on anyways, however; Maria and Henry, as well as Mary and Edmund -LRB-who has been prevailed upon to take a role to avoid bringing in an outsider to play it-RRB-, get to play some rather racy scenes with one another. When one of the women cannot make a rehearsal, Fanny is pressured to take a role. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is almost forced to give in when Sir Thomas makes a sudden entrance, having arrived from Antigua. Sir Thomas is unhappy about the play and quickly puts a stop to the improprieties. Since Henry has not declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) love, Maria is married to Rushworth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) and Julia leave Mansfield Park for London. Relationships between the Crawfords and the Bertrams intensify. Edmund nearly proposes to Mary several times, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) condescension and amorality always stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) at the last minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) confides his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) feelings to Fanny, who is secretly upset by them. In the meantime, on a lark, Henry has decided to woo Fanny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is surprised to find himself sincerely in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Fanny has become indispensable as a companion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt and uncle, and on the occasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother William's visit, they give a ball in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) honor. Some time after the ball, Henry helps William get a promotion in the Navy. Using this as leverage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) proposes to Fanny, who is mortified and refuses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) continues to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle is disappointed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has refused such a wealthy man, and, as an indirect result, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is sent to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) parents in their filthy house. Meanwhile, Edmund has been ordained and continues to debate over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) relationship with Mary, to Fanny's dismay. Henry comes to see Fanny at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) parents' and renews his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) suit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) then leaves to take care of business on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) estate. Fanny continues to receive letters from Mary encouraging her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to take Henry's proposal. A series of events then happen in rapid succession: Tom Bertram falls dangerously ill as a result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) partying and nearly dies; Henry, who has gone not to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) estate but to see friends, has run off with the married Maria; Julia, upset over her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister's rash act, elopes with Yates, Tom's friend. Fanny is recalled to Mansfield, bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) younger sister Susan with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Edmund has finally seen through Mary, who has admitted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would like to see Tom die so that Edmund could be heir, and who has more or less condoned Henry and Maria's actions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is heartbroken, but Fanny consoles him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Maria and Henry eventually split, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) goes to the Continent to live with the evil Mrs. Norris. Julia and Yates are reconciled to the family. Edmund finally comes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) senses and marries Fanny, and Susan takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) place with the Bertrams. Edmund, Fanny, and the rest of those at Mansfield live happily, while Henry, Mary, and Maria are cast out.
