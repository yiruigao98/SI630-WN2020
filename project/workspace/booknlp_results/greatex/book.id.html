with his sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in
a cemetery one evening looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) parents' tombstones. Suddenly,
an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Pip,
and orders him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) food and a file for his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) leg irons. Pip obeys,
but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects
Pip by claiming to have stolen the items himself. One day Pip is taken by his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) Uncle Pumblechook to play
at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Havisham, who
is extremely eccentric: she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) wears an old wedding dress everywhere
she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) goes and keeps all the clocks in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) house stopped at the same
time. During his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) visit, he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) meets a beautiful young girl named Estella,
who treats him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) falls
in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that
he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) might be worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) even hopes that Miss Havisham intends to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) a gentleman and marry him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) to Estella, but his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) hopes are dashed
when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Havisham
decides to help him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) become a common laborer in his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) family's business. With Miss Havisham's guidance, Pip is apprenticed
to his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) brother-in-law, Joe, who is the village blacksmith. Pip works
in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) education with
the help of the plain, kind Biddy and encountering Joe's malicious day
laborer, Orlick. One night, after an altercation with Orlick, Pip's
sister, known as Mrs. Joe, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute
invalid. From her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) signals, Pip suspects that Orlick was responsible
for the attack. One day a lawyer named Jaggers appears with strange news:
a secret benefactor has given Pip a large fortune, and Pip must
come to London immediately to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) education as a gentleman.
Pip happily assumes that his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) previous hopes have come true--that
Miss Havisham is his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for
him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) to marry Estella. In London, Pip befriends a young gentleman named Herbert Pocket
and Jaggers's law clerk, Wemmick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) expresses disdain for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) former
friends and loved ones, especially Joe, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) continues to pine
after Estella. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) furthers his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) education by studying with the tutor
Matthew Pocket, Herbert's father. Herbert himself helps Pip learn
how to act like a gentleman. When Pip turns twenty-one and begins
to receive an income from his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) will secretly help Herbert
buy his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) way into the business he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) has chosen for himself. But for
now, Herbert and Pip lead a fairly undisciplined life in London, enjoying
themselves and running up debts. Orlick reappears in Pip's life,
employed as Miss Havisham's porter, but is promptly fired by Jaggers
after Pip reveals Orlick's unsavory past. Mrs. Joe dies, and Pip
goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several
years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Pip's room--the
convict, Magwitch, who stuns Pip by announcing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), not Miss
Havisham, is the source of Pip's fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) tells Pip that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was
so moved by Pip's boyhood kindness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) dedicated his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) life to
making Pip a gentleman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) made a fortune in Australia for that
very purpose. Pip is appalled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) feels morally bound to help Magwitch escape
London, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Compeyson,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall
into place when Pip discovers that Compeyson was the man who abandoned
Miss Havisham at the altar and that Estella is Magwitch's daughter.
Miss Havisham has raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to break men's hearts, as revenge for
the pain her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own broken heart caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). Pip was merely a boy for
the young Estella to practice on; Miss Havisham delighted in Estella's
ability to toy with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) affections. As the weeks pass, Pip sees the good in Magwitch and begins
to care for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) deeply. Before Magwitch's escape attempt, Estella
marries an upper-class lout named Bentley Drummle. Pip makes a visit to
Satis House, where Miss Havisham begs his (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) forgiveness for the way
she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) has treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) in the past, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) forgives her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). Later that day,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) bends over the fireplace, her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) clothing catches fire and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
goes up in flames. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) survives but becomes an invalid. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) final
days, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) will continue to repent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) misdeeds and to plead for
Pip's forgiveness. The time comes for Pip and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) friends to spirit Magwitch
away from London. Just before the escape attempt, Pip is called
to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) encounters the vengeful,
evil Orlick. Orlick is on the verge of killing Pip when Herbert
arrives with a group of friends and saves Pip's life. Pip and Herbert
hurry back to effect Magwitch's escape. They try to sneak Magwitch down
the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who
Compeyson tipped off. Magwitch and Compeyson fight in the river,
and Compeyson is drowned. Magwitch is sentenced to death, and Pip
loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fortune. Magwitch feels that his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) sentence is God's forgiveness
and dies at peace. Pip falls ill; Joe comes to London to care for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and they are reconciled. Joe gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) the news from home:
Orlick, after robbing Pumblechook, is now in jail; Miss Havisham
has died and left most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) fortune to the Pockets; Biddy has taught
Joe how to read and write. After Joe leaves, Pip decides to rush
home after him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) and marry Biddy, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) arrives there he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) discovers
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and Joe have already married. Pip decides to go abroad with Herbert to work in the mercantile trade.
Returning many years later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) encounters Estella in the ruined
garden at Satis House. Drummle, her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) husband, treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) badly,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is now dead. Pip finds that Estella's coldness and cruelty
have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden
hand in hand, Pip believing that they will never part again. -LRB-Note: Dickens's
original ending to Great Expectations differed from
the one described in this summary. The final Summary and Analysis
section of this SparkNote provides a description of the first ending
and explains why Dickens rewrote it.-RRB-
