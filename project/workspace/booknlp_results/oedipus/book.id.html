the disaster that has just befallen them. Their brothers Polynices
and Eteocles have killed one another in a battle for control over
Thebes. Creon now rules the city, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) has ordered that Polynices,
who brought a foreign army against Thebes, not be allowed proper burial
rites. Creon threatens to kill anyone who tries to bury Polynices
and stations sentries over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) body. Antigone, in spite of Creon's
edict and without the help of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ismene</b></font>) sister Ismene, resolves to give
their brother a proper burial. Soon, a nervous sentry arrives at the
palace to tell Creon that, while the sentries slept, someone gave Polynices
burial rites. Creon says that he (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) thinks some of the dissidents of
the city bribed the sentry to perform the rites, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) vows to
execute the sentry if no other suspect is found. The sentry soon exonerates himself by catching
Antigone in the act of attempting to rebury her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) brother, the sentries
having disinterred him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Antigone freely confesses her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) act to Creon
and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) himself defies the will of the gods by refusing
Polynices burial. Creon condemns both Antigone and Ismene
to death. Haemon, Creon's son and Antigone's betrothed, enters the
stage. Creon asks him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) opinion on the issue. Haemon
seems at first to side with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, but gradually admits his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
opposition to Creon's stubbornness and petty vindictiveness. Creon
curses him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and threatens to slay Antigone before his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) very eyes.
Haemon storms out. Creon decides to pardon Ismene, but vows to kill
Antigone by walling her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) up alive in a tomb. The blind prophet Tiresias arrives, and Creon promises
to take whatever advice he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) gives. Tiresias advises that Creon allow Polynices
to be buried, but Creon refuses. Tiresias predicts that the gods
will bring down curses upon the city. The words of Tiresias strike
fear into the hearts of Creon and the people of Thebes, and Creon
reluctantly goes to free Antigone from the tomb where she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) has been
imprisoned. But his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) change of heart comes too late. A messenger
enters and recounts the tragic events: Creon and his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) entourage first
gave proper burial to Polynices, then heard what sounded like Haemon's
voice wailing from Antigone's tomb. They went in and saw Antigone
hanging from a noose, and Haemon raving. Creon's son then took a
sword and thrust it at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father. Missing, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) turned the sword
against himself and died embracing Antigone's body. Creon's wife,
Eurydice, hears this terrible news and rushes away into the palace.
Creon enters, carrying Haemon's body and wailing against his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own
tyranny, which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knows has caused his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son's death. The messenger
tells Creon that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has another reason to grieve: Eurydice has stabbed
herself, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) died, she (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) called down curses on her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) husband
for the misery his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pride had caused. Creon kneels and prays that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), too, might die. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) guards lead him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back into the palace. A plague has stricken Thebes. The citizens gather outside
the palace of their king, Oedipus, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) to take action. Oedipus
replies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) already sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) brother-in-law, Creon, to the oracle
at Delphi to learn how to help the city. Creon returns with a message
from the oracle: the plague will end when the murderer of Laius,
former king of Thebes, is caught and expelled; the murderer is within
the city. Oedipus questions Creon about the murder of Laius, who
was killed by thieves on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) way to consult an oracle. Only one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) fellow travelers escaped alive. Oedipus promises to solve
the mystery of Laius's death, vowing to curse and drive out the
murderer. Oedipus sends for Tiresias, the blind prophet, and asks
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) knows about the murder. Tiresias responds cryptically,
lamenting his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) ability to see the truth when the truth brings nothing
but pain. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) refuses to tell Oedipus what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) knows. Oedipus
curses and insults the old man, going so far as to accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) of
the murder. These taunts provoke Tiresias into revealing that Oedipus
himself is the murderer. Oedipus naturally refuses to believe Tiresias's
accusation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) accuses Creon and Tiresias of conspiring against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) life, and charges Tiresias with insanity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) asks why Tiresias
did nothing when Thebes suffered under a plague once before. At
that time, a Sphinx held the city captive and refused to leave until
someone answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) riddle. Oedipus brags that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) alone was able
to solve the puzzle. Tiresias defends his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) skills as a prophet, noting
that Oedipus's parents found him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) trustworthy. At this mention of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) parents, Oedipus, who grew up in the distant city of Corinth,
asks how Tiresias knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) parents. But Tiresias answers enigmatically.
Then, before leaving the stage, Tiresias puts forth one last riddle,
saying that the murderer of Laius will turn out to be both father
and brother to his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) own children, and the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) own wife. After Tiresias leaves, Oedipus threatens Creon with death
or exile for conspiring with the prophet. Oedipus's wife, Jocasta
-LRB-also the widow of King Laius-RRB-, enters and asks why the men shout
at one another. Oedipus explains to Jocasta that the prophet has
charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) with Laius's murder, and Jocasta replies that all prophecies
are false. As proof, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) notes that the Delphic oracle once told
Laius he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) would be murdered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) son, when in fact his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) son was
cast out of Thebes as a baby, and Laius was murdered by a band of
thieves. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) description of Laius's murder, however, sounds familiar
to Oedipus, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) asks further questions. Jocasta tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) that
Laius was killed at a three-way crossroads, just before Oedipus
arrived in Thebes. Oedipus, stunned, tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) may
be the one who murdered Laius. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) tells Jocasta that, long ago,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) was the prince of Corinth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) overheard someone mention
at a banquet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) was not really the son of the king and queen.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) therefore traveled to the oracle of Delphi, who did not answer
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) but did tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) would murder his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) father and sleep with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>)
mother. Hearing this, Oedipus fled his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) home, never to return. It
was then, on the journey that would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) to Thebes, that Oedipus
was confronted and harassed by a group of travelers, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) killed
in self-defense. This skirmish occurred at the very crossroads where
Laius was killed. Oedipus sends for the man who survived the attack, a shepherd, in
the hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) will not be identified as the murderer. Outside
the palace, a messenger approaches Jocasta and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>)
has come from Corinth to inform Oedipus that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) father, Polybus,
is dead, and that Corinth has asked Oedipus to come and rule there
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) place. Jocasta rejoices, convinced that Polybus's death from
natural causes has disproved the prophecy that Oedipus would murder his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>)
father. At Jocasta's summons, Oedipus comes outside, hears the news,
and rejoices with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) now feels much more inclined to agree
with the queen in deeming prophecies worthless and viewing chance
as the principle governing the world. But while Oedipus finds great
comfort in the fact that one-half of the prophecy has been disproved,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) still fears the other half--the half that claimed he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) would sleep
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) mother. The messenger remarks that Oedipus need not worry, because Polybus
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) wife, Merope, are not Oedipus's biological parents. The
messenger, a shepherd by profession, knows firsthand that Oedipus
came to Corinth as an orphan. One day long ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) was tending his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>)
sheep when another shepherd approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) carrying a baby, its
ankles pinned together. The messenger took the baby to the royal
family of Corinth, and they raised him (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) as their own. That baby was
Oedipus. Oedipus asks who the other shepherd was, and the messenger
answers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) was a servant of Laius. Oedipus asks that this shepherd be brought forth to testify,
but Jocasta, beginning to suspect the truth, begs her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) husband not
to seek more information. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) runs back into the palace. The shepherd
then enters. Oedipus interrogates him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>), asking who gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) the baby. The
shepherd refuses to disclose anything, and Oedipus threatens him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>)
with torture. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) answers that the child came from the house
of Laius. Questioned further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) answers that the baby was in fact
the child of Laius himself, and that it was Jocasta who gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) the
infant, ordering him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) to kill it, as it had been prophesied that
the child would kill his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) parents. But the shepherd pitied the child,
and decided that the prophecy could be avoided just as well if the
child were to grow up in a foreign city, far from his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) true parents.
The shepherd therefore passed the boy on to the shepherd in Corinth. Realizing who he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) is and who his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) parents are, Oedipus screams that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) sees the truth and flees back into the palace. The shepherd and
the messenger slowly exit the stage. A second messenger enters and
describes scenes of suffering. Jocasta has hanged herself, and Oedipus,
finding her (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) dead, has pulled the pins from her (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) robe and stabbed
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) own eyes. Oedipus now emerges from the palace, bleeding
and begging to be exiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) asks Creon to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) away from Thebes
and to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) daughters, Antigone and Ismene. Creon, covetous
of royal power, is all too happy to oblige. After years of wandering in exile from Thebes, Oedipus
arrives in a grove outside Athens. Blind and frail, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) walks with
the help of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) daughter, Antigone. Oedipus and Antigone learn from
a citizen that they are standing on holy ground, reserved for the
Eumenides, goddesses of fate. Oedipus sends the citizen to fetch
Theseus, the king of Athens and its surroundings. Oedipus tells
Antigone that, earlier in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) life, when Apollo prophesied his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) doom,
the god promised Oedipus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) would come to rest on this ground. After an interlude in which Oedipus tells the Chorus who
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) is, Oedipus's second daughter, Ismene, enters, having gone to
learn news from Apollo's oracle at Delphi. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) that, back
in Thebes, Oedipus's younger son, Eteocles, has overthrown Polynices,
the elder, and that Polynices is now amassing troops in Argos for
an attack on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) brother and on Creon, who rules along with Eteocles.
The oracle has predicted that the burial place of Oedipus will bring
good fortune to the city in which it is located, and both sons,
as well as Creon, know of this prophecy. Both Polynices and Creon
are currently en route to try to take Oedipus into custody and thus
claim the right to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) in their kingdoms. Oedipus swears he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>)
will never give his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) support to either of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) sons, for they did
nothing to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) exile years ago. King Theseus arrives and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) pities Oedipus for
the fate that has befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) asks how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) can help Oedipus.
Oedipus asks Theseus to harbor him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) in Athens until his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) death, but
warns that by doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) this favor, Theseus will incur the wrath
of Thebes. Despite the warning, Theseus agrees to help Oedipus. Creon appears in order to abduct Oedipus, but, proving
unsuccessful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) kidnaps Antigone and Ismene instead. Theseus promises Oedipus
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) will get his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) daughters back. Theseus does in fact return
with Oedipus's daughters shortly. Soon after, Polynices arrives, seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) father's favor
in order to gain custody of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) eventual burial site. Oedipus asks
Theseus to drive Polynices away, but Antigone convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Antigone</b></font>) father
to listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) son. Polynices tells Oedipus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) never condoned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) exile, and that Eteocles is the bad son, having bribed the men
of Thebes to turn against Polynices. Oedipus responds with a terrible
curse, upbraiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) son for letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) be sent into exile, and
predicting that Eteocles and Polynices will die at one another's
hands. Polynices, realizing he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) will never win his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) father's support,
turns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) sisters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) asks that they provide him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) with a proper
burial should he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) die in battle. Antigone embraces Polynices, saying
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) is condemning himself to death, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) resolutely says that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) life remains in the hands of the gods. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) prays for the safety
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) sisters and then leaves for Thebes. Terrible thunder sounds, and the Chorus cries out in horror. Oedipus
says that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) time of death has come. Sending for Theseus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) tells
the king he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) must carry out certain rites on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) body, and that by
doing so he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) may assure divine protection to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) city. Theseus says that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) believes Oedipus and asks what to do. Oedipus answers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>)
will lead the king to the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) will die, and that Theseus must
never reveal that spot, but pass it on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) son at his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) own death,
who in turn must pass it on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) own son. In this way Theseus
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) heirs may always rule over a safe city. Oedipus then strides
off with a sudden strength, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) daughters and Theseus to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) grave. A messenger enters to narrate the mysterious death of
Oedipus: his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) death seemed a disappearance of sorts, <div class="bookquote">``the lightless
depths of Earth bursting open in kindness to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>Oedipus</b></font>)</div>-LRB-1886--1887-RRB-.
Just as the messenger finishes his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) story, Antigone and Ismene come onstage,
chanting a dirge. Antigone wails that they will cry for Oedipus
for as long as they live. Not knowing where to go now, Antigone says
they will have to wander forever alone. Theseus returns to the stage,
asking the daughters to stop their weeping. They plead to see their
father's tomb, but Theseus insists that Oedipus has forbidden it.
They give up their pleas but ask for safe passage back to Thebes, so
that they may prevent a war between their brothers. Theseus grants
them this, and the Chorus tells the girls to stop their weeping, for
all rests in the hands of the gods. Theseus and the Chorus exit toward
Athens; Antigone and Ismene head for Thebes.
