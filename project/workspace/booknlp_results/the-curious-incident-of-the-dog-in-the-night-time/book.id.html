the year 1998 in and around the town of Swindon, England. The fifteen-year-old narrator
of the story, Christopher John Francis Boone, discovers the slain body of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boone</b></font>) neighbor's
poodle, Wellington, on the neighbor's front lawn one evening and sets out to uncover the
murderer. His (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) investigation is at times aided, and at other times hampered, by the mild
form of autism he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) lives with. After Christopher hits a policeman in a misunderstanding
at the scene of the crime, the police take Christopher into custody. They release
Christopher with only a stern warning, under the condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) promises to them and
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) father not to look into the murder any further. Christopher chronicles his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) investigation in a book--the book we are reading--as part
of a school assignment. Ignoring repeated warnings from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) father, Christopher
investigates the crime scene and conducts interviews with the residents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) block. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>)
uncovers a more tangled plot than was first apparent when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) discovers that his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) father
and the owner of the slain dog, Mrs. Shears, had a romantic affair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) subsequently
learns that their affair began in reaction to another relationship, one carried on
between Mr. Shears and Christopher's mother, before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) disappeared from Christopher's
life. At school, Christopher prepares for an A-level math exam that will enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) to
attend a university, a feat no other child at his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) school has managed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) also continues
to work on his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) book. Upon returning home one afternoon, Christopher accidentally leaves
his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) book in plain view on the kitchen table. His (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) father reads it, becomes angry, and
confiscates it. Later, Christopher searches for the book and uncovers a series of
letters, hidden in a shirt box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) father's closet, addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>)
supposedly dead mother. The letters chronicle a life that his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) mother has continued to
lead with Mr. Shears in London and contain repeated requests for Christopher to respond.
In shock, Christopher passes out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) bedroom surrounded by the evidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>)
father's deception. When Father comes home and realizes what has happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) breaks
down in tears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) apologizes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) lies, explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) acted out of a desire to
protect Christopher from the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) mother's abandonment of the family.
Christopher's father also admits to killing Wellington after an argument with Mrs.
Shears, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) lover. Christopher, now terrified of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) father and feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) can no longer trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>),
sneaks out of the house and travels to London to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) mother. During a
harrowing journey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) copes with and overcomes the social fears and limitations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>)
condition, dodges police, and almost gets hit by a train. His (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) arrival at his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) mother's
flat comes as a total surprise to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no idea that Christopher's father had
been withholding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) letters. Christopher settles in for a time at his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) mother and Mr.
Shears's flat, but friction caused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) presence shortly results in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) mother's
decision to leave Mr. Shears to return to Swindon. Christopher moves into a new
apartment with his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) mother and begins to receive regular visits from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) father. When
Christopher's pet rat Toby dies, Christopher's father gives Christopher a puppy. At
school, Christopher sits for his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) A-level math exam and receives an A grade, the best
possible score. The novel ends with Christopher planning to take more A-level exams in
physics and further math, and then attend a university in another town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>)
can do all of this because he (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) solved the mystery of Wellington's murder, was brave
enough to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) mother, and wrote the book that we have read.
