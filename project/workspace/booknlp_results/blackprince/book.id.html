In order to write a great novel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) quits his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) lifelong job as a tax inspector, but soon finds himself struck with writer's block. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) decides to spend the summer in a rented cottage on the coast for inspiration. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) can leave for the coast, however, a series of events keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) home. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) detested ex-wife's brother, Francis visits him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) finds out that his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) ex wife, Christian, has returned to London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is called to intervene in a marital dispute between his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) close friends, Arnold and Rachel Baffin. Arnold is a successful but unartistic writer. During the fight, Rachel Baffin hits her (<font color='blue'><b>Baffin</b></font>) head on the fireplace poker, but is not dead, as Arnold initially fears. After leaving their house, Bradley runs into the Baffins' twenty-year-old daughter, Julian, by the subway station. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wants Bradley to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) how to write. The next morning, Bradley's sister, Priscilla, unexpectedly arrives, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) has left her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) almost immediately tries to commit suicide with sleeping pills. During the confusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) suicide attempt, for which all of the Baffins and Francis Marloe are present, Christian, Bradley's ex-wife, appears, but is taken away by Arnold before Bradley sees her (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>). After Priscilla gets back from the hospital, Bradley visits Christian in order to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) alone. Bradley then goes to Bristol to pick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) sister's jewels. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) is unable to do so, and finds that Priscilla's husband has a younger, pregnant mistress. Priscilla starts staying at Christian's house so Francis Marloe, a former doctor, can care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>). While all of this is happening, Arnold Baffin becomes interested in having an affair with Christian and Rachel Baffin becomes interested in sleeping with Bradley. During Rachel and Bradley's attempted lovemaking, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) cannot perform sexually. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) and Rachel later determine to become platonic friends. Julian has been pestering Bradley to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) about Hamlet and arrives one day for a tutorial. During the tutorial, Bradley falls passionately in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) initially tries to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) love secret. After becoming physically ill while watching Der Rosenkavalier with Julian however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) confesses his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) emotions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) tells Julian that he (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) is forty-six, instead of fifty-eight. Julian considers the issue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) love thoughtfully. By the next morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) has determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>). Julian later confesses her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) parents. They respond by locking her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) room and yelling at Bradley. Despite Rachel and Arnold's anger, Bradley refuses to see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) love is inappropriate. When Julian sneaks away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) parents' house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) and Bradley meet and leave for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) rented cottage. On their first day away, Julian entertains romantic fantasies about marrying Bradley. Their initial attempts at lovemaking are not successful. The next day, Bradley finds out that Priscilla has killed herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) keeps the news from Julian to maintain their bliss. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) returns home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) finds Julian dressed up as Hamlet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) drags her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) to the bed and makes violent love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) in such a rough way that Julian later weeps. Arnold finds them later that night and begs Julian to leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Julian</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) of Priscilla's death and Bradley's true age. Julian seems confused, but refuses go. After her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) father leaves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) isolates herself in a separate bedroom to think, but is gone by the time Bradley wakes in the morning. Bradley goes back to London for Priscilla's funeral. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) believes that Arnold stole Julian away in the night. Bradley cannot find her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) anywhere. Christian wants to start a relationship with Bradley, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) declines. Rachel tells Bradley that Julian left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) freely because she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) learned of Bradley's recent sexual encounter with Rachel -LRB-Rachel had described the encounter in a letter that Arnold delivered-RRB-. Bradley is so angry at Rachel's interference that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) spitefully shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) a letter that Arnold wrote describing Arnold's love for Christian. Rachel is furious and vows never to forgive Bradley. A few days later, Bradley receives a letter from Julian. Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) saying otherwise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) decides that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) still loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) is in Venice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) makes plans to go there. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) can leave, however, Rachel calls and begs for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) immediate assistance. After arriving at the Baffins' house, Bradley finds Arnold dead, having been hit with the same fire poker that once hit Rachel. When Bradley tries to cover up Rachel's crime, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) is accused of it himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) is later convicted because everyone believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) killed Arnold out of envy. Bradley has written his (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) novel from prison. In the final postscript of the book, the editor, P.Loxias, notes that soon after finishing the book, Bradley Pearson died of a fast growing cancer.
