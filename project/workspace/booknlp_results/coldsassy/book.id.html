Blakeslee announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blakeslee</b></font>) intends to marry Miss Love Simpson,
a hat-maker at his (<font color='blue'><b>Blakeslee</b></font>) store who is years younger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Blakeslee</b></font>). This news shocks
his (<font color='blue'><b>Blakeslee</b></font>) family, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Blakeslee</b></font>) wife Mattie Lou died only three weeks earlier.
Rucker's daughters, Mary Willis and Loma, worry about what the gossips
of Cold Sassy, Georgia, will think of their father's impropriety.
Will Tweedy, Rucker's fourteen-year-old grandson and the narrator
of the novel, supports his (<font color='blue'><b>Tweedy</b></font>) grandfather's marriage. Will thinks Miss
Love is nice and pretty, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) comes from Baltimore and
therefore is practically a Yankee. Will thinks that Rucker needs
someone to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) now that Mattie Lou is gone. On the afternoon
Rucker announces his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) engagement, Will sneaks off to go fishing in
the country despite the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) is supposed to be in mourning
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) grandmother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) walks across a high, narrow train trestle
and nearly dies when a train speeds toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) survives by hurling
himself between the tracks so the train passes just overhead without
actually touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>). Will becomes a sensation after his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) near-death
experience, and the whole town comes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) house to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) about
the incident. Rucker shocks everyone by arriving with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) new bride,
Miss Love. The people of Cold Sassy disapprove of Rucker's hasty
marriage, and rumors spread quickly. Will, however, spends a great
deal of time at the Blakeslee house and becomes friends with Miss
Love. Will soon learns that the marriage is one of convenience and
that Rucker and Miss Love sleep in separate rooms. Miss Love tells
Will that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) married Rucker only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) promised to deed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>)
the house and furniture. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) part, Rucker married Miss Love
to save on the cost of a housekeeper. One day, Clayton McAllister,
Miss Love's former fianc√© from Texas, shows up and tries to persuade Miss
Love to leave with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), but Miss Love sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) away
contemptuously. Miss Effie Belle Tate, a local gossip, sees the kiss
and promptly spreads the news all over town. Will and some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) friends make a trip into the country
to pick up a horse for Miss Love, camping in the mountains along
the way. When they return, Will and his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) father, Hoyt, try to convince
Will's mother, Mary Willis, to go on a trip to New York. Rucker
has bought the tickets to New York so that Hoyt, who works for Rucker,
can go to purchase new goods for the store. At first Mary Willis
refuses to go because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is in mourning, but Will and Hoyt convince
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that the trip will do her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) good. Right after Mary Willis changes
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind, Rucker decides to use the tickets himself to go to New
York with Miss Love. Mary Willis is crushed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hatred of Miss
Love increases. To take his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) and Mary Willis's mind off the disappointment,
Hoyt buys a brand new Cadillac and becomes the first motorcar owner
in Cold Sassy history. Rucker and Miss Love return from New York. They are now
flirtatious and affectionate with each other, and Will wonders whether their
marriage is becoming more legitimate. Rucker announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) too
has bought a car and intends to begin selling cars in Cold Sassy.
Lightfoot McLendon is a classmate of Will's who lives in the impoverished
section of Cold Sassy known as Mill Town. One day Will takes Lightfoot
on a car ride to the cemetery, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lightfoot</b></font>) kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>). A nosy neighbor
sees the kiss and tells Will's parents. Outraged at Will's association
with common people, Will's parents forbid him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) to drive the Cadillac
for two months. Will gets around his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) punishment by driving Rucker's
car. One Sunday, Will, Rucker, and Miss Love take a day trip into
the country, where Will gives them driving lessons. On the way back
to Cold Sassy, Will crashes the car into a creek bed and damages
the radiator. While they wait for a repair team to arrive, they
stay with a family that lives nearby. That night, Will
overhears Rucker tell Miss Love that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) and wants their marriage
to be real. Miss Love declares that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) cannot marry and that no
man would want her (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) terrible secret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) tells Rucker that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) father raped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) was a child. Rucker says her (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) past does
not lessen his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>), but Miss Love sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) away. Eventually, Miss Love and Rucker fall deeply in love.
Will's uncle, Camp Williams, commits suicide, which begins a dark
period in Cold Sassy. Rucker hires Will's worst enemy, Hosie Roach,
to work at the store in Camp's place. Because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) new income,
Hosie can marry Will's beloved Lightfoot. A pair of thieves robs
and beats Rucker. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) recovers from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) injuries,
Rucker catches pneumonia. As Rucker lies sick in bed, Will overhears
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) tell Miss Love that God provides strength and comfort to the
faithful in times of trouble. Miss Love tells Will that although
Rucker does not know it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) is pregnant with Rucker's child. Rucker
dies shortly after he (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) falls ill, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Rucker</b></font>) message of faith in God
gives Will strength to cope. Though the town and Will's family do
not accept Miss Love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) knows that they will all accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sassy</b></font>) child,
and plans on staying in Cold Sassy.
