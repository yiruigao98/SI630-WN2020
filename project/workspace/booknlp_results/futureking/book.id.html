Sword and the Stone,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>we are introduced to the
Wart, a young boy who eventually becomes King Arthur. The Wart grows
up in the castle of Sir Ector, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) foster father. The Wart spends
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) days in the company of Kay, Sir Ector's son and the heir to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) title, amusing himself as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) can while Kay is instructed
in the proper ways of knighthood. One night while lost in the forest,
the Wart encounters the magician Merlyn, a befuddled but powerful
old man who announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be the Wart's tutor. During the
next six years, Merlyn tries to instill some of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wisdom in the
Wart, teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about virtue and the world by turning the Wart
into various animals. Finally, Kay is knighted, and the Wart becomes
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) squire, a kind of servant who assists and attends to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) master
as the knight travels in search of adventure. When the king of England,
Uther Pendragon, dies, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) leaves no heir, and it is proclaimed that
the next rightful king will be whoever can pull out a mysterious sword
that has been driven into a rock. The Wart and Kay travel to London,
where a tournament is being held so that the finest knights will
have the opportunity to try to remove the sword. While running an
errand for Kay, the Wart removes the sword from the stone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>)
is declared the next king of England. Book II, <div class="bookquote">``The Queen of Air and Darkness,''
 (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>finds the young King Arthur, as the Wart is now called, trying to
hold on to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) power. Of the men rebelling against Arthur, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) most
notable enemy is King Lot of Orkney. As the war rages on in England, Lot's
sons, Gawaine, Gaheris, Gareth, and Agravaine, compete for the affections
of their mother, the beautiful but cruel Morgause. By a twist of
fate, Morgause is also Arthur's half-sister, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) does not
know it. Three knights from Arthur's court arrive at Orkney, and
unaware that their king is at war with Lot, they proceed to bumble
around the countryside. Although Gawaine, Gaheris, and Gareth are
all decent at heart, they and their brother, Agravaine, are happiest
when they are listening to stories about their proud
heritage and dreaming about wars and bloody revenge. In England, Arthur begins to plan how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) will
rule when the battles are finally over. With Merlyn's guidance,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) decides to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own power and that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fellow knights to
fight for people who cannot defend themselves. Arthur creates an
order of knights to fight for good, called the Knights of the Round
Table. Then, with the help of two French kings, Bors and Ban, Arthur defeats
Lot's army at the battle of Bedegraine. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) four children,
Morgause travels to Arthur's court, supposedly to reconcile Arthur
with Lot. While at the court, she (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) uses magic to seduce Arthur. Arthur
is not aware that Morgause is his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) half-sister, but the incest is
still a great sin, and by sleeping with her (<font color='blue'><b>half-sister</b></font>), Arthur ultimately brings
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own destruction. Book III, <div class="bookquote">``The Ill-Made Knight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the knight Lancelot</b></font>)</div>focuses on the great
knight Lancelot and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) moral conflicts. Lancelot is just a boy
when King Arthur takes the throne, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eventually becomes Arthur's
greatest knight and best friend. Trying to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) growing feelings
for Queen Guenever, Lancelot embarks on a series of quests that
establish his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) reputation. In the last of these, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is tricked into
sleeping with a young girl named Elaine. Guenever grows increasingly
jealous of Elaine, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>) jealousy eventually drives Lancelot insane.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) roams England for several years as a wild man, unrecognized and
ill-treated by everyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) meets. Finally, Elaine discovers Lancelot
and nurses him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) back to health. Although Lancelot does not want to
feel obligated to Elaine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) does, and on two occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) leaves
Camelot to spend time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>) and their son, Galahad. Meanwhile, Arthur's
kingdom begins to unravel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tries to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights occupied
by sending them to find the Holy Grail. Only three knights, Sir
Bors, Sir Percival, and Sir Galahad, are pure enough to find the
holy vessel. Lancelot returns a humbled and deeply religious
man. For a while, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love for God makes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stay away from Guenever,
but after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rescues her (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>) from a kidnapper, they begin their affair
again. In Book IV, <div class="bookquote">``The Candle in the Wind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordred</b></font>)</div>the destruction
of Camelot becomes inevitable. Mordred, Arthur's son by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) incestuous union
with Morgause, plots revenge against his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father. Mordred and Agravaine
trap Arthur into acknowledging the affair between Lancelot and Guenever,
which forces Arthur to prosecute his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) queen and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) best friend.
Lancelot rescues Guenever from being burned at the stake, but in
doing so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) kills two of Gawaine's brothers, Gareth and Gaheris.
Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) armies lay siege to Lancelot's castle. The pope sends
an emissary to broker a truce, and Guenever returns to Arthur's
castle at Camelot. Arthur and Gawaine, however, still want to avenge
the deaths of Gareth and Gaheris, and they continue to besiege Lancelot.
While they are away, Mordred usurps the throne. Arthur rushes back
to reclaim his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) kingdom. The night before his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) final stand against
Mordred, Arthur reflects on all he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) has learned since his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) youth and
wakes up confident that although this day will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) last, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
legacy will live on.
