to Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, who was two-thirds god and one-third
man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) built magnificent ziggurats, or temple towers, surrounded
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) city with high walls, and laid out its orchards and fields.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was physically beautiful, immensely strong, and very wise. Although
Gilgamesh was godlike in body and mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kingship as
a cruel despot. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lorded over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) subjects, raping any woman who
struck his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fancy, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the wife of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) warriors
or the daughter of a nobleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accomplished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) building projects
with forced labor, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exhausted subjects groaned under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
oppression. The gods heard his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) subjects' pleas and decided to keep
Gilgamesh in check by creating a wild man named Enkidu, who was
as magnificent as Gilgamesh. Enkidu became Gilgamesh's great friend, and
Gilgamesh's heart was shattered when Enkidu died of an illness inflicted
by the gods. Gilgamesh then traveled to the edge of the world and
learned about the days before the deluge and other secrets of the
gods, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) recorded them on stone tablets. The epic begins with Enkidu. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lives with the animals,
suckling at their breasts, grazing in the meadows, and drinking
at their watering places. A hunter discovers him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) and sends a temple
prostitute into the wilderness to tame him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>). In that time, people
considered women and sex calming forces that could domesticate wild
men like Enkidu and bring them into the civilized world. When Enkidu
sleeps with the woman, the animals reject him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) is no longer
one of them. Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) is part of the human world. Then the harlot
teaches him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) everything he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) needs to know to be a man. Enkidu is outraged
by what he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hears about Gilgamesh's excesses, so he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) travels to Uruk
to challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) arrives, Gilgamesh is about to force his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>)
way into a bride's wedding chamber. Enkidu steps into the doorway
and blocks his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) passage. The two men wrestle fiercely for a long
time, and Gilgamesh finally prevails. After that, they become friends
and set about looking for an adventure to share. Gilgamesh and Enkidu decide to steal trees from a distant
cedar forest forbidden to mortals. A terrifying demon named Humbaba, the
devoted servant of Enlil, the god of earth, wind, and air, guards it.
The two heroes make the perilous journey to the forest, and, standing
side by side, fight with the monster. With assistance from Shamash
the sun god, they kill him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>). Then they cut down the forbidden trees,
fashion the tallest into an enormous gate, make the rest into a
raft, and float on it back to Uruk. Upon their return, Ishtar, the goddess
of love, is overcome with lust for Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh spurns her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>).
Enraged, the goddess asks her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) father, Anu, the god of the sky, to
send the Bull of Heaven to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>). The bull comes down from
the sky, bringing with him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) seven years of famine. Gilgamesh and
Enkidu wrestle with the bull and kill it. The gods meet in council and
agree that one of the two friends must be punished for their transgression,
and they decide Enkidu is going to die. He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) takes ill, suffers immensely,
and shares his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) visions of the underworld with Gilgamesh. When he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>)
finally dies, Gilgamesh is heartbroken. Gilgamesh can't stop grieving for Enkidu, and he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) can't
stop brooding about the prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) own death. Exchanging his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) kingly
garments for animal skins as a way of mourning Enkidu, he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sets off
into the wilderness, determined to find Utnapishtim, the Mesopotamian
Noah. After the flood, the gods had granted Utnapishtim eternal
life, and Gilgamesh hopes that Utnapishtim can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) might
avoid death too. Gilgamesh's journey takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) to the twin-peaked
mountain called Mashu, where the sun sets into one side of the mountain
at night and rises out of the other side in the morning. Utnapishtim
lives beyond the mountain, but the two scorpion monsters that guard
its entrance refuse to allow Gilgamesh into the tunnel that passes
through it. Gilgamesh pleads with them, and they relent. After a harrowing passage through total darkness, Gilgamesh emerges
into a beautiful garden by the sea. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) meets Siduri, a veiled
tavern keeper, and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) quest. She (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) warns him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) that
seeking immortality is futile and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) should be satisfied with the
pleasures of this world. However, when she (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) can't turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) away from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) purpose, she (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) directs him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) to Urshanabi, the ferryman. Urshanabi
takes Gilgamesh on the boat journey across the sea and through the
Waters of Death to Utnapishtim. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the
story of the flood--how the gods met in council and decided to destroy
humankind. Ea, the god of wisdom, warned Utnapishtim about the gods'
plans and told him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) how to fashion a gigantic boat in which his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) family
and the seed of every living creature might escape. When the waters
finally receded, the gods regretted what they'd done and agreed
that they would never try to destroy humankind again. Utnapishtim
was rewarded with eternal life. Men would die, but humankind would
continue. When Gilgamesh insists that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) be allowed to live forever,
Utnapishtim gives him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) a test. If you think you can stay alive for
eternity, he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) says, surely you can stay awake for a week. Gilgamesh
tries and immediately fails. So Utnapishtim orders him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) to clean
himself up, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) royal garments again, and return to Uruk
where he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) belongs. Just as Gilgamesh is departing, however, Utnapishtim's wife
convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) to tell Gilgamesh about a miraculous plant that restores
youth. Gilgamesh finds the plant and takes it with him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), planning
to share it with the elders of Uruk. But a snake steals the plant
one night while they are camping. As the serpent slithers away, it
sheds its skin and becomes young again. When Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) is empty-handed but
reconciled at last to his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) mortality. He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) can't live
forever but that humankind will. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sees that the city he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) had
repudiated in his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) grief and terror is a magnificent, enduring achievement--the closest
thing to immortality to which a mortal can aspire.
