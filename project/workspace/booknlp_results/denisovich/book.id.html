labor camp in 1951, on a bitterly cold winter
morning. Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, a prisoner in Camp HQ, is usually
up on time, but this morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suffers a fever and aches, and yearns for
a little more time in bed. Thinking that a kindly guard is on duty,
he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) rests past the wake-up call a while. Unfortunately, a different
guard is making the rounds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) punishes Shukhov for oversleeping
with three days in the solitary confinement cell, which the characters
call <div class="bookquote">``the hole.''  (<font color='red'><b>the characters</b></font>)</div>Led off, Shukhov soon realizes that the sentence
is just a threat, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) will only have to wash the floors
of the officers' headquarters. Shukhov removes his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) shoes and efficiently
completes the job, proceeding quickly to the mess hall, where he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
worries he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) has missed breakfast. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) meets the sniveling Fetyukov,
a colleague who has saved Shukhov's gruel for him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>). After breakfast,
Shukhov heads to sick bay to get his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) fever and aches examined. The
medical orderly, Kolya, tells him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) should have been ill the previous
night, since the clinic is closed in the morning. Shukhov's fever
is not high enough to get him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) off work. Shukhov returns to the hut in time for the body search
and body count, in which the prisoners are searched for forbidden
articles and counted to make sure none have escaped. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) carefully
hides the bread he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) has taken at breakfast, sewing it into his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) mattress.
The men undress in the freezing cold for the search. One inmate,
Buynovsky, is wearing a flannel vest. He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) is sentenced to ten days
in the hole for this infraction. Shukhov is happy not to have any
forbidden things on him (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) has neither food nor letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>)
family, which he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) does not write anymore. He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) reflects on his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) wife's
recent letter urging him (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) to take up carpet-dyeing when he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) gets out
of prison. But Shukhov is not interested in this opportunity, despite
the easy money. After the search, Shukhov's group, Gang 104, is
marched off for work at the Power Station, a building site in the
open fields. At the site, Shukhov looks at his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) colleague Alyoshka,
a devout Baptist who seems happy to slave away. Shukhov is filled
with respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) foreman, Tyurin, a big tough man with a decent
soul. Though they are forbidden to do so, the men try to keep the
wind out of the windows by covering them with tar paper. The teenage
prisoner Gopchik fetches wire for piping, and asks Shukhov to show
him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) how to make a spoon. They all rest a while. It is too soon before
the noon meal to start laying bricks, as the mortar would only dry
in the trough while they ate. At the noon meal, Shukhov sneaks a second helping of food.
He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) is full after eating two bowls of gruel. The gang returns to
the work site. On the way, Shukhov spots a bit of scrap metal in
the snow, which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) takes and hides in the hopes of making a knife
out of it later. The prisoners stoke the stove. While preparing
to work again, the gang hears Tyurin's tale of being imprisoned
for having a rich peasant father. The men begin to mortar the wall.
One of the deputy foremen, Pavlo, agrees to be on the mortar team,
though, as an officer, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) is not required to mortar. Pavlo's friendliness
earns him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) the men's respect. The bricklaying begins. Shukhov works
feverishly and makes no errors. A camp manager stops by to chide
Tyurin for the tar paper illegally hung in the work site windows.
He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) threatens to punish Tyurin, but Tyurin waves him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) off. Alyoshka
works selflessly. Time passes quickly, and the men hear the meal
signal. Shukhov continues working, even after his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) colleague Kildigs
has stopped. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) is late to lunch now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) wants to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) precious trowel,
a tool that is hard to get, so that another man will not take it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is nearly unable to join his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gang, but catches up when the gang
is delayed by preparations for another body count. The men discover that
a man from Moldavia is missing from another gang. The man, who has
fallen asleep at the site, is finally found. The other men are furious
at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for delaying their meal. Shukhov remembers his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earlier intention to go to sick
bay but reflects that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would rather have supper. At the body search, Shukhov
suddenly panics, remembering the bit of steel he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mitten. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prays to God to be kept out of the hole. By a stroke
of good luck, the guard does not discover the bit of steel. Shukhov
returns to the camp. On the suspicion that a fellow inmate, Tsezar,
has received a rich parcel of food, he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) offers to wait in line in the
parcel room for Tsezar. Shukhov waits until Tsezar comes. There is
indeed a package. Shukhov makes his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) way to the mess hall for supper,
where the gangs are being admitted by twos instead of singly, creating
a chaos inside. He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) manages to find his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) comrades, grab an empty tray,
and bring their rations to the table. For his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) outstanding labor
at the Power Station, Shukhov has been awarded 400 grams of
bread. He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) eats in bliss, eyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) extra rations to make sure no one
grabs them. He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) takes Tsezar's ration to the hut, where Tsezar, in exception
to the camp rules, is allowed to eat. Tsezar has displayed the contents
of his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) parcel to everyone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) allows Shukhov to keep Tsezar's
supper ration. After the body count, Shukhov prepares to sleep, though
the second count has not yet been completed. He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) revels in his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) abundance
of bread. At the second roll call, Tsezar panics, unsure what to
do with his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) parcel. Shukhov helps him (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) guard it from the other prisoners. Tsezar
rewards Shukhov with a couple of biscuits and a bit of sausage.
Before sleeping, Shukhov thanks God for getting him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) through another
day. Alyoshka hears Shukhov's prayer, and urges Shukhov to pray
properly. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) also encourages Shukhov to pursue the goods of the
spirit and not, as Tsezar does, those of the flesh. Shukhov reflects
on Alyoshka's sentiment. Suddenly, for no reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands Alyoshka
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) biscuits. Shukhov meditates that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) day has been almost
happy. The narrator adds that this day has been just one of the 3,653 days
of Shukhov's sentence.
