Loman returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) home in Brooklyn one night, exhausted from
a failed sales trip. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) wife, Linda, tries to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>)
boss, Howard Wagner, to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Wagner</b></font>) work in New York so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wagner</b></font>) won't
have to travel. Willy says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) will talk to Howard the next
day. Willy complains that Biff, his (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) older son who has come back
home to visit, has yet to make something of himself. Linda scolds
Willy for being so critical, and Willy goes to the kitchen for a
snack. As Willy talks to himself in the kitchen, Biff and his (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>)
younger brother, Happy, who is also visiting, reminisce about their
adolescence and discuss their father's babbling, which often includes
criticism of Biff's failure to live up to Willy's expectations.
As Biff and Happy, dissatisfied with their lives, fantasize about
buying a ranch out West, Willy becomes immersed in a daydream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>)
praises his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) sons, now younger, who are washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) car. The young
Biff, a high school football star, and the young Happy appear. They
interact affectionately with their father, who has just returned
from a business trip. Willy confides in Biff and Happy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) is
going to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) own business one day, bigger than that owned by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) neighbor, Charley. Charley's son, Bernard, enters looking for
Biff, who must study for math class in order to avoid failing. Willy
points out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) sons that although Bernard is smart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) is not
<div class="bookquote">``well liked,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which will hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) in the long run. A younger Linda enters, and the boys leave to do some
chores. Willy boasts of a phenomenally successful sales trip, but
Linda coaxes him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) into revealing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) trip was actually only
meagerly successful. Willy complains that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) soon won't be able
to make all of the payments on their appliances and car. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) complains
that people don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>)'s not good at his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) job. As
Linda consoles him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) hears the laughter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) mistress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) approaches
The Woman, who is still laughing, and engages in another reminiscent daydream.
Willy and The Woman flirt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) thanks him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) for giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) stockings. The Woman disappears, and Willy fades back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) prior
daydream, in the kitchen. Linda, now mending stockings, reassures him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) scolds her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) mending and orders her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) to throw the stockings out.
Bernard bursts in, again looking for Biff. Linda reminds Willy that
Biff has to return a football that he (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) stole, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) adds that Biff is
too rough with the neighborhood girls. Willy hears The Woman laugh
and explodes at Bernard and Linda. Both leave, and though the daydream
ends, Willy continues to mutter to himself. The older Happy comes
downstairs and tries to quiet Willy. Agitated, Willy shouts his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>)
regret about not going to Alaska with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) brother, Ben, who eventually
found a diamond mine in Africa and became rich. Charley, having
heard the commotion, enters. Happy goes off to bed, and Willy and
Charley begin to play cards. Charley offers Willy a job, but Willy,
insulted, refuses it. As they argue, Willy imagines that Ben enters.
Willy accidentally calls Charley Ben. Ben inspects Willy's house
and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) has to catch a train soon to look at properties
in Alaska. As Willy talks to Ben about the prospect of going to
Alaska, Charley, seeing no one there, gets confused and questions
Willy. Willy yells at Charley, who leaves. The younger Linda enters
and Ben meets her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>). Willy asks Ben impatiently about his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) life. Ben
recounts his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) travels and talks about their father. As Ben is about
to leave, Willy daydreams further, and Charley and Bernard rush
in to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) that Biff and Happy are stealing lumber. Although Ben
eventually leaves, Willy continues to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>). Back in the present, the older Linda enters to find Willy
outside. Biff and Happy come downstairs and discuss Willy's condition
with their mother. Linda scolds Biff for judging Willy harshly.
Biff tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) knows Willy is a fake, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) refuses to
elaborate. Linda mentions that Willy has tried to commit suicide.
Happy grows angry and rebukes Biff for his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) failure in the business
world. Willy enters and yells at Biff. Happy intervenes and eventually
proposes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) and Biff go into the sporting goods business together.
Willy immediately brightens and gives Biff a host of tips about
asking for a loan from one of Biff's old employers, Bill Oliver.
After more arguing and reconciliation, everyone finally goes to
bed. Act II opens with Willy enjoying the breakfast
that Linda has made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>). Willy ponders the bright-seeming future
before getting angry again about his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) expensive appliances. Linda informs
Willy that Biff and Happy are taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) out to dinner that night.
Excited, Willy announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) is going to make Howard Wagner
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) a New York job. The phone rings, and Linda chats with Biff,
reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) to be nice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) father at the restaurant that night. As the lights fade on Linda, they come up on Howard playing with
a wire recorder in his (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) office. Willy tries to broach the subject
of working in New York, but Howard interrupts him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) and makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) listen
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) kids and wife on the wire recorder. When Willy finally gets
a word in, Howard rejects his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) plea. Willy launches into a lengthy
recalling of how a legendary salesman named Dave Singleman inspired
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) to go into sales. Howard leaves and Willy gets angry. Howard
soon re-enters and tells Willy to take some time off. Howard leaves
and Ben enters, inviting Willy to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) in Alaska. The younger
Linda enters and reminds Willy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) sons and job. The young Biff
enters, and Willy praises Biff's prospects and the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>)
is well liked. Ben leaves and Bernard rushes in, eagerly awaiting Biff's
big football game. Willy speaks optimistically to Biff about the
game. Charley enters and teases Willy about the game. As Willy chases
Charley off, the lights rise on a different part of the stage. Willy
continues yelling from offstage, and Jenny, Charley's secretary,
asks a grown-up Bernard to quiet him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) down. Willy enters
and prattles on about a <div class="bookquote">``very big deal''  (<font color='red'><b>Willy</b></font>)</div>that Biff is working on.
Daunted by Bernard's success -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) mentions to Willy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) is going
to Washington to fight a case-RRB-, Willy asks Bernard why Biff turned
out to be such a failure. Bernard asks Willy what happened in Boston
that made Biff decide not to go to summer school. Willy defensively
tells Bernard not to blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>). Charley enters and sees Bernard off. When Willy asks for
more money than Charley usually loans him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>), Charley again offers
Willy a job. Willy again refuses and eventually tells Charley that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) was fired. Charley scolds Willy for always needing to be liked
and angrily gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) the money. Calling Charley his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) only friend,
Willy exits on the verge of tears. At Frank's Chop House, Happy helps Stanley, a waiter,
prepare a table. They ogle and chat up a girl, Miss Forsythe, who
enters the restaurant. Biff enters, and Happy introduces him (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) to
Miss Forsythe, continuing to flirt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Forsythe</b></font>). Miss Forsythe, a call
girl, leaves to telephone another call girl -LRB-at Happy's request-RRB-,
and Biff spills out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) waited six hours for Bill Oliver and
Oliver didn't even recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>). Upset at his (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) father's unrelenting
misconception that he (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>), Biff, was a salesman for Oliver, Biff plans
to relieve Willy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) illusions. Willy enters, and Biff tries
gently, at first, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) what happened at Oliver's office.
Willy blurts out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) was fired. Stunned, Biff again tries to
let Willy down easily. Happy cuts in with remarks suggesting Biff's
success, and Willy eagerly awaits the good news. Biff finally explodes at Willy for being unwilling to
listen. The young Bernard runs in shouting for Linda, and Biff,
Happy, and Willy start to argue. As Biff explains what happened,
their conversation recedes into the background. The young Bernard
tells Linda that Biff failed math. The restaurant conversation comes
back into focus and Willy criticizes Biff for failing math. Willy
then hears the voice of the hotel operator in Boston and shouts
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) is not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) room. Biff scrambles to quiet Willy and claims
that Oliver is talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) partner about giving Biff the money.
Willy's renewed interest and probing questions irk Biff more, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) screams at Willy. Willy hears The Woman laugh and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) shouts back
at Biff, hitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) and staggering. Miss Forsythe enters with another
call girl, Letta. Biff helps Willy to the washroom and, finding
Happy flirting with the girls, argues with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) about Willy. Biff
storms out, and Happy follows with the girls. Willy and The Woman enter, dressing themselves and flirting. The
door knocks and Willy hurries The Woman into the bathroom. Willy
answers the door; the young Biff enters and tells Willy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) failed
math. Willy tries to usher him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) out of the room, but Biff imitates
his (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) math teacher's lisp, which elicits laughter from Willy and The
Woman. Willy tries to cover up his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) indiscretion, but Biff refuses to
believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) stories and storms out, dejected, calling Willy a <div class="bookquote">``phony
little fake.''  (<font color='red'><b>Willy</b></font>)</div>Back in the restaurant, Stanley helps Willy up. Willy
asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) can find a seed store. Stanley gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) directions
to one, and Willy hurries off. The light comes up on the Loman kitchen, where Happy enters looking
for Willy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) moves into the living room and sees Linda. Biff comes
inside and Linda scolds the boys and slaps away the flowers in Happy's
hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) yells at them for abandoning Willy. Happy attempts to
appease her (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>), but Biff goes in search of Willy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) finds Willy planting
seeds in the garden with a flashlight. Willy is consulting Ben about
a $20,000 proposition. Biff approaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>)
to say goodbye and tries to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) inside. Willy moves into the
house, followed by Biff, and becomes angry again about Biff's failure. Happy
tries to calm Biff, but Biff and Willy erupt in fury at each other.
Biff starts to sob, which touches Willy. Everyone goes to bed except
Willy, who renews his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) conversation with Ben, elated at how great
Biff will be with $20,000 of insurance money.
Linda soon calls out for Willy but gets no response. Biff and Happy
listen as well. They hear Willy's car speed away. In the requiem, Linda and Happy stand in shock after Willy's poorly
attended funeral. Biff states that Willy had the wrong dreams. Charley
defends Willy as a victim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) profession. Ready to leave, Biff
invites Happy to go back out West with him (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>). Happy declares that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Biff</b></font>) will stick it out in New York to validate Willy's death. Linda
asks Willy for forgiveness for being unable to cry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linda</b></font>) begins to
sob, repeating <div class="bookquote">``We're free...''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>All exit, and the flute melody
is heard as the curtain falls.
