The sun is not shining, and fog covers the valley. On Henry Allen's foothill ranch, the hay cutting and storing has been finished, and the orchards are waiting for rain. Elisa Allen, Henry's wife, is working in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) flower garden and sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) husband speaking with two cigarette-smoking strangers. Elisa is thirty-five years old, attractive and clear-eyed, although at the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) is clad in a masculine gardening outfit with men's shoes and a man's hat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) apron covers her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) dress, and gloves cover her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) hands. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) works away at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) chrysanthemums, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) steals occasional glances at the strange men. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) house, which stands nearby, is very clean. The strangers get into their Ford coupe and leave. Elisa looks down at the stems of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) flowers, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) has kept entirely free of pests. Henry appears and praises her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) work. Elisa seems pleased and proud. Henry says he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) would turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) talents to the orchard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) responds eagerly to this suggestion, but it seems he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was only joking. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) asks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) that the men were from the Western Meat Company and bought thirty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) steers for a good price. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) suggests they go to the town of Salinas for dinner and a movie to celebrate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) teases her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>), asking whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>)'d like to see the fights, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) wouldn't. Henry leaves, and Elisa turns her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) attention back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) chrysanthemums. A wagon with a canvas top driven by a large bearded man appears on the road in the distance. A misspelled sign advertises the man's services as a tinker who repairs pots and pans. The wagon turns into Elisa's yard. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) dogs and the man's dog sniff each other, and the tinker makes a joke about the ferocity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) animal. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets out of the wagon, Elisa sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is big and not very old. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wears a ragged, dirty suit, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands are rough. They continue to make small talk, and Elisa is charmed when the tinker says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply follows good weather. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) has any work for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) repeatedly says no, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whines, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hasn't had any business and is hungry. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks about Elisa's chrysanthemums, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) annoyance vanishes. They discuss the flowers, and the tinker says that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a customer who wants to raise chrysanthemums. Excited, Elisa says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can take her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) some shoots in a pot filled with damp sand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) takes off her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) hat and gloves and fills a red pot with soil and the shoots. Elisa gives the tinker instructions to pass along to the woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) explains that the most care is needed when the budding begins. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) claims to have planting hands and can feel the flowers as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>)'s one with them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) speaks from a kneeling position, growing impassioned. The tinker says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) means, and Elisa interrupts him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to talk about the stars, which at night are <div class="bookquote">``driven into your body''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and are <div class="bookquote">``hot and sharp and--lovely.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) reaches out to touch his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pant leg, but stops before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) does. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says such things are not as nice if you haven't eaten. Sobered, Elisa finds two pans for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to fix. As the tinker works, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeps in the wagon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) wishes women could live the kind of life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says it wouldn't be suitable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) asks how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows. After paying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fifty cents, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) can do the same work he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life would be lonesome and frightening for a woman. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaves, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to keep the sand around the chrysanthemums damp. For a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems to forget that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the flowers. Elisa watches the wagon trundle away, whispering to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) goes into the house and bathes, scrubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) skin with pumice until it hurts. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) examines her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) naked body in the mirror, pulling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) stomach and pushing out her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) chest, then observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) dresses in new underwear and a dress and does her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) hair and makeup. Henry comes home and takes a bath. Elisa sets out his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) clothes and then goes to sit on the porch. When Henry emerges, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) looks nice, sounding surprised. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) means, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) looks <div class="bookquote">``different, strong and happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) asks what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) means by strong. Confused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>)'s playing a game and then explains that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) looks like she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) could break a calf and eat it. Elisa loses her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) composure for a moment and then agrees with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). As they drive along the road toward Salinas, Elisa sees a dark spot up ahead and can't stop herself from looking at it, sure that it's a pile of discarded chrysanthemum shoots that the tinker has thrown away. Elisa thinks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could have at least disposed of them off the road, and then realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had to keep the pot. They pass the tinker's wagon, and Elisa doesn't look. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) is looking forward to dinner. Henry says she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) is different again, but then says kindly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) should take her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) out more often. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) asks whether they can have wine at dinner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) says yes. Elisa says she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) has read that at the fights the men beat each other until their boxing gloves are soaked with blood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) asks whether women go to the fights, and Henry says that some do and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'ll take her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) to one if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>)'d like to go. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) declines and pulls her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) coat collar over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) face so that Henry can't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elisa</b></font>) crying.
