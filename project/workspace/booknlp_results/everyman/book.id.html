Present are former advertising colleagues, friends from the retirement village, the everyman's three children Nancy, Randy and Lonny, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lonny</b></font>) older brother Howie and Howie's wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lonny</b></font>) ex-wife Phoebe, and Maureen, who was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lonny</b></font>) private nurse. One by one, the everyman's loved ones drop handfuls of soil onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Lonny</b></font>) coffin, starting with Nancy, who delivers a eulogy explaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) relationship to the everyman, and followed by Howie, who recounts childhood memories of the everyman, in particular their father's shop in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The funeral ends and the mourners walk away from the grave. The book shifts to the night before the everyman's last operation, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) dies, as the everyman thinks back on the women in his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) life who were present at other operations, from his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) third and final wife Merete, to Maureen, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) had an affair with while married to Merete, to his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) mother who accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) to the hospital for a hernia operation when he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) was a child. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) remembers the hernia operation in great detail as a formative experience that shapes his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) fear of death and illness for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) life. The everyman becomes unwell after a holiday on Martha's Vineyard with his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) new love, Phoebe. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) had left behind his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) first wife Cecelia and their two sons for Phoebe, and is suffering from guilt. His (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) mind turns to the fear of oblivion. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) returns to New York, and an analyst tells him (<font color='blue'><b>analyst</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>analyst</b></font>) is feeling ill because of internalized envy of a colleague. The everyman eventually persuades his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) doctor to admit him (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) to hospital. There, it turns out he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) is suffering from a burst appendix and could have died.  Phoebe and Howie help the everyman through his (<font color='blue'><b>Howie</b></font>) recovery. Twenty-two years pass while the everyman is in good health. Then, in 1989, the everyman becomes ill again. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) thinks it is brought about by the stress of watching his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) father slowly dying, but it is due to heart disease. His (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) experiences in the hospital this time remind him (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) boyhood operation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) no longer has his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) mother to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>). Merete is completely overwhelmed but Howie steps in to provide private nurses to look after the everyman. This is how the everyman meets Maureen, and they begin their affair. The everyman's father dies. Though the everyman himself is strongly anti-religion, his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) father had become more religious in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old age. Watching his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father being buried by Howie and his (<font color='blue'><b>Howie</b></font>) sons is a dreadful experience for the everyman, who is still recovering from his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) operation. This is because he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) must finally stare oblivion in the face and acknowledge that everyone's life ends in death. After another nine years of good health, the everyman falls ill again and has a stent inserted into his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) arteries. A few years after this he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) leaves Manhattan in the wake of the 9/11 bombings and moves to the Starfish Beach retirement village at the Jersey Shore and takes up painting, his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) passion. The only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) misses about New York is his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) daughter Nancy, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) has a good relationship. But the year after the stent operation, he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) has another operation, this time on his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) carotid artery. From then on he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) is hospitalized every year for problems with his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) heart and arteries. Nancy is there to provide reassurance. The everyman thinks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) goodness as a miracle. In contrast, he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) does not get on at all with his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) sons Randy and Lonny. The everyman teaches painting classes in his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) retirement village. One student, Millicent Kramer, is a recent widow suffering from terrible back pain and a sense of humiliation over her (<font color='blue'><b>Millicent</b></font>) perceived helplessness and dependency. She (<font color='blue'><b>Millicent</b></font>) later kills herself, which forces the everyman again to face his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) own mortality. The everyman's relationship with Howie becomes worse because he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) envies Howie's good health. Because of this, the everyman deliberately isolates himself from Howie. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) also feels lonely because he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) no longer has the romantic company of women in his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) life. After a polite rejection from a young jogger outside his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) condo, the everyman stops painting, despite Nancy's encouragement to keep making pictures. Earlier, in his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) fifties, the everyman had an affair with first his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) secretary, a woman of nineteen, then a twenty-four-year-old model named Merete. His (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) second wife Phoebe reveals she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) is aware of the affairs after Merete and the everyman fly to Paris to be with each other. The everyman then leaves Phoebe to marry Merete. The marriage is not a success because Merete is vain and weak and cannot support him (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) gets sick. Living in the retirement community, the everyman finds trying to pass the time without company or painting very difficult. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) sustains himself with memories and then his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) fantasies, first of seducing the woman jogger who rejects him (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>), then of living with Nancy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) family in New York. This fantasy ends when Phoebe has a stroke and Nancy plans to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>). The everyman makes several phone calls, first to Gwen, the recent widow of a former colleague, then Brad Karr, a former colleague who is now a patient in a psychiatric hospital, and finally Ezra Pollock, another former colleague who is suffering from terminal cancer. These calls exhaust and depress him (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) and once more make him (<font color='blue'><b>Pollock</b></font>) confront the idea of the inevitability and pitilessness of aging and death. The everyman later receives the upsetting news that Ezra Pollock has died, and soon after, tests show that the everyman needs a surgery on his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) second carotid artery. The everyman considers his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) relationships with his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) loved ones and becomes increasingly gloomy. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) tries unsuccessfully to reconnect with Howie, who happens to be away on holiday. Broken-hearted, lonely and in poor health, the everyman finally allows himself to confront his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) end. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) goes to the cemetery where his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) parents and grandparents are buried and communes with his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) parents' bones, which reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) life. Even though the everyman does not believe in an afterlife, the reality of their bones is a source of comfort and he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) finds it hard to leave them behind. As an excuse not to leave, he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) strikes up a conversation with a gravedigger. In minute detail, the gravedigger describes the process of burial. The everyman is comforted by the dutiful work that goes into the process of digging and filling a grave. Going into his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) operation, he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) is in a good mood. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) remembers the joy of being a young boy swimming in the sea. But choosing general anesthetic instead of local anesthetic leads to his (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) death on the operating table. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) has finally succumbed to the oblivion he (<font color='blue'><b>everyman</b></font>) feared.
