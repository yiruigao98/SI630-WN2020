Didion's account of the year following the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) husband,
writer John Gregory Dunne, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) attempts to make sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>)
grief while tending to the severe illness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) adopted daughter,
Quintana. On December 30, 2003,
John and Didion go to the hospital to visit their daughter, who
is in a coma in the intensive care unit. Later that evening, John
has a massive heart attack while sitting down to dinner in their
New York apartment. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is pronounced dead shortly after arriving
at the hospital, but Didion finds herself unable to accept this
fact even as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arranges for an autopsy and plans for his (<font color='blue'><b>Didion</b></font>) funeral. As she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tries to make sense of John's death and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own
changed identity, Didion discovers that grief is not what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) expected
it to be. Consumed by memories of the years they lived in Los Angeles, shortly
after they married and adopted Quintana, Didion feels that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has
entered a state of temporary insanity. Though cool and collected
on the surface, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) begins to believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wishes might have
the power to bring John back. To this end, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) refuses to give away
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) clothes and shoes, believing that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband will need them
when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) calls this childlike belief that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thoughts
and wishes can alter reality <div class="bookquote">``magical thinking.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) finds numerous
examples of this behavior in the literature she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) studies on grief
and mourning, which ranges from poems, novels, psychological texts,
and even etiquette books. As Didion tries to figure out a way to fix the situation
and bring John back, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) becomes fixated on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) memories of the
months leading up to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) death. Also in December of that year, Quintana
had developed a severe case of flu that worsened in the days leading
up to Christmas, though doctors reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was on the
road to recovery. On Christmas morning, Quintana checked into the
hospital, where she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) went into septic shock as a result of the pneumonia that
had overtaken her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lungs. Though John's spirits had been buoyed by
both a new pacemaker as well as Quintana's wedding earlier that
year, the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quintana</b></font>) daughter's condition devastated him (<font color='blue'><b>Quintana</b></font>), prompting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Quintana</b></font>) to begin assessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quintana</b></font>) own life. Several days before his (<font color='blue'><b>Quintana</b></font>) death,
John had told his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was a failure. Quintana doesn't
wake from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) coma until January 2004, though soon
after being discharged she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must return briefly, because of blood
clotting in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) legs. After her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) second release, the family decides
to hold the funeral for John, after which Quintana will travel to
Malibu, California, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband to recuperate. Didion realizes
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will have to get back to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life as well. Shortly after arriving in the Los Angeles airport, however,
Quintana experiences a massive brain hemorrhage that requires emergency
neurosurgery at UCLA. Doctors fear she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will not survive, and if
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may have suffered brain damage. Didion immediately
flies to Los Angeles to be with Quintana, reassuring her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
will get better even though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knows that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is powerless to protect
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter. Didion spends every day at the hospital and begins
to experience what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) calls <div class="bookquote">``the vortex effect,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>a reaction in which
environmental triggers unexpectedly set off emotionally crippling
flashbacks of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life with John and Quintana. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tries
to avoid landmarks that remind her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of in the happy years the family
spent in Los Angeles in the 1970s, the vortex
effect occurs at the most unexpected times. After several months,
Quintana moves to a stepdown observational unit, with plans made
to transfer her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to the Rusk Institute in New York. After the transfer,
Quintana again begins the slow process of recuperation and Didion
again tries to resume her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life. Didion begins to examine her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) memories for omens and symbols that
might have warned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of John's impending death. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looks to literature,
to events from their shared life , and to clues that John seemed
to leave in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own novels. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) becomes consumed with the idea of
self-pity, its relationship to grief and mourning, and how these
feelings are perceived by society. Realizing that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had almost never
been separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband during their forty years of marriage,
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) finds herself turning inward in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) solitude, consumed by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
own thoughts. In an effort to get back to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) normal life, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) makes
plans to cover the Democratic and Republican conventions for the New
York Review of Books. Though the conventions seem to pose
little risk of setting off the vortex effect, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) finds herself
paralyzed by memories no matter where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) goes or what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does. Didion begins to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has gone insane as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
experiences both magical thinking and the vortex effect. To regain
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grip on reality, Didion looks back to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) past and tries to
remember what the world used to mean to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). As a child, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remembers,
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fixated on meaninglessness, believing that the massive geological
changes that occur slowly over time indicated the smallness and
brevity of human experience. As an adult, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had once found meaning
in the routines of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life and in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) role as a wife and mother,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) now realizes that, following John's death, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has lost
the sense of self those roles once afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) understands
that John is dead, Didion cannot understand how or why. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thinking
only begins to clarify once she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) receives the emergency room and
autopsy reports, nearly a year after John's death. The reports confirm
that John was dead from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sat down to dinner. Didion could
have tried to fix the situation, but it would have been futile; there
was nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could have done about it then, and nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can
do about it now. Didion's vivid memories of the months before John's
death begin to fade, but though her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heated mental state subsides,
no clarity or sense of purpose replaces it. Didion begins to focus
again on the routines of daily life, accepting the inevitability
of change, which forces us to adapt and, eventually, to move on.
