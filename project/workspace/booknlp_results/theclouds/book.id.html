Strepsiades calls in a Slave to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) accounts so that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may tabulate his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) debts. Looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) debts, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) becomes enraged and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice wakes Pheidippides. Strepsiades begs Pheidippides to refrain from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expensive ways and begs him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to enroll in the new-fangled school next door wherein he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may learn about esoteric natural sciences as well as sophistry that might help him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) outwit their creditors in court. Pheidippides stubbornly refuses, leaving Strepsiades to enroll himself. Strepsiades arrives at the school and meets a Student who tells Strepsiades about Socrates's new experiments involving insects and astronomy. The Student shows Strepsiades the other Students of the school, bent over in their studies so that they may study geology with their faces and astronomy with their behinds. While the Student is showing Strepsiades their maps, Socrates appears in a balloon-basket hanging in mid-air. Socrates explains that the contraption helps him (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``suspend''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I.i.230-RRB- his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) judgment and open his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) mind to new ideas. Strepsiades explains his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) plight and asks for guidance. Socrates enlightens Strepsiades, proving to him (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) that the gods do not exist and that the weather patterns are produced by a Chorus of Clouds. Socrates fleeces Strepsiades of his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) coat and hustles him (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) inside. In Strepsiades's absence, the Chorus of Clouds sings a song in defense of the play, berating the audience for not rewarding it when it was first produced. The Chorus praises the moral intent of the playwright and the important examples his (<font color='blue'><b>playwright</b></font>) satire teaches in troubled times. Socrates and Strepsiades reemerge and discuss the gender of nouns. Socrates puts Strepsiades in a louse-ridden bed to contemplate. After much agony, Strepsiades shares his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) ludicrous theories for how to win his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) court case. Socrates despairs and calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) a worthless pupil. The Chorus of Clouds convinces Strepsiades to enroll his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) son instead. Strepsiades runs home and quizzes Pheidippides with his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) newly acquired sophistry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) drags Pheidippides to the school where the two Arguments, Just and Unjust, argue over the proper model for boys' education. Just suggests a model of education based on traditional poetry and physical fitness, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) descriptions falter when his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) libido overwhelms him (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>). Unjust unravels Just's argument with examples drawn from myth and other trivia. Just is thoroughly flustered and Unjust is granted Pheidippides as a pupil. The Chorus of Clouds intimates that Strepsiades's forcible education of Pheidippides will be his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) own undoing before turning to the audience, wheedling, bribing, and even threatening them for their approval of the play. Strepsiades's day in court draws near and he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) goes to pick Pheidippides up at the school. Socrates promises that Pheidippides is well-versed in their special brand of specious learning which Pheidippides soon demonstrates when he (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) attacks the idiom the day of <div class="bookquote">``Old and New''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as an instance of hysterical paradox. While Strepsiades is gloating that his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) son is a splendid example of Unjust Argument, he (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) is visited by two creditors. The First Creditor demands that Strepsiades appear before the court. Strepsiades quizzes him (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) about the gender of nouns and refuses to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) debt on the basis of the First Creditor's apparent ignorance. The Second Creditor appears woefully wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) hands and begging Strepsiades. Strepsiades berates him (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) belief in the gods and uses the Unjust Argument to deny responsibility for any interest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) debt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) flogs the Second Creditor until he (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) runs off. The Chorus sings a song warning that Strepsiades's <div class="bookquote">``evil''  (<font color='red'><b>Strepsiades</b></font>)</div>-LRB-II.i.1303-RRB- will soon come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>). Sure enough, as their song winds down, Strepsiades bursts from the house while being beaten by Pheidippides. The two have been quarreling over the recitation of traditional poetry. Pheidippides defends his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) beatings using sophistry. Strepsiades mourns that he (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) has exchanged Pheidippides's obsession with expensive horses for his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) obsession with sophistry and rhetoric, which is proving to also have its price. Strepsiades blames the Chorus of Clouds for misleading him (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) and they defend themselves by asserting that their deception taught Strepsiades a lesson. Strepsiades concedes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) has been wrong but still hungers to do violence against Socrates and the school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) summons his (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) slave Xanthias and the two run over to the school and set fire to the roof. Chaerephon and a Second Student cry out from within as the building burns and finally rush outside. Strepsiades crows his (<font color='blue'><b>Student</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Revenge''  (<font color='red'><b>Strepsiades</b></font>)</div>-LRB-II.i.1506-RRB- and chases off the last of the Students by throwing rocks. The Chorus appraises the scene and takes its leave.
