a lower-class group of Oklahoma youths who call themselves greasers
because of their greasy long hair. Walking home from a movie, Ponyboy
is attacked by a group of Socs, the greasers' rivals, who are upper-class
youths from the West Side of town. The Socs, short for Socials,
gang up on Ponyboy and threaten to slit his (<font color='blue'><b>Curtis</b></font>) throat. A group of greasers
comes and chases the bullies away, saving Ponyboy. Ponyboy's rescuers
include his (<font color='blue'><b>Curtis</b></font>) brother Sodapop, a charming, handsome high-school dropout,
and Darry, Ponyboy's oldest brother -LRB-Darry assumed responsibility
for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brothers when their parents were killed in a car crash-RRB-.
The rest of the greasers who come to Ponyboy's rescue are Johnny,
a sensitive sixteen-year-old; Dally, a hardened street hood with
a long criminal record; Steve, Sodapop's best friend; and Two-Bit,
the oldest and funniest group member. The next night, Ponyboy and Johnny go to a movie with
Dally. They sit behind a pair of attractive Soc girls. Dally flirts
with the girls obnoxiously. After Johnny tells Dally to stop harassing
the Soc girls, Dally walks away. Johnny and Ponyboy sit with the
girls, who are named Cherry and Marcia, and Ponyboy and Cherry discover
that they have a lot in common. Two-Bit arrives, and the three greasers begin
to walk the Soc girls to Two-Bit's house so he (<font color='blue'><b>Cherry</b></font>) can drive them home.
On the way to Two-Bit's house, they run into Bob and Randy, the
girls' drunken boyfriends. The girls must leave with their boyfriends
in order to prevent a fight between the Socs and the greasers. Ponyboy is late getting home, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) brother Darry is
furious with him (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>). Sick of Darry's constant scrutiny and criticism,
Ponyboy yells at Darry. The brothers begin to fight, and Darry slaps
Ponyboy across the face. Ponyboy flees, determined to run away.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) finds Johnny, and the two boys heads for the park. There they
encounter Bob and Randy with a group of Soc boys. The Socs attack
Johnny and Ponyboy, and one of them holds Ponyboy's head under the
frigid water of a fountain until Ponyboy blacks out. Ponyboy regains
consciousness to find himself lying on the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is next to
Johnny--and next to Bob's corpse. Johnny tells Ponyboy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) -LRB-Johnny-RRB-
killed Bob because the Socs were going to drown Ponyboy and beat
up Johnny. Desperate and terrified, Ponyboy and Johnny hurry to
find Dally Winston, the one person they think might be able to help
them. Dally gives them a gun and some money and sends them to an
abandoned church near the neighboring town of Windrixville. They
hide out in the church for a week, cutting and dying their hair
to disguise themselves, reading Gone with the Wind aloud,
and discussing poetry. After several days, Dally comes to check
on Ponyboy and Johnny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) tells the boys that, since Bob's death,
tensions between the greasers and the Socs have escalated. A rumble
is to take place the next night to settle matters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) says that
Cherry, who feels partially responsible for Bob's death, has been
acting as a spy for the greasers. Johnny shocks Dally by declaring
his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) intention to go back and turn himself in. Dally agrees to drive Ponyboy and Johnny back home. However, as
the boys leave, they notice that the abandoned church where Ponyboy
and Johnny have been staying has caught fire. They discover that
a group of schoolchildren has wandered inside. Ponyboy and Johnny
rush into the inferno to save the children. Just as they get the
last child through the window, the roof caves in, and Ponyboy blacks
out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) regains consciousness in an ambulance. At the hospital,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is diagnosed with minor burns and bruises. Dally is not badly hurt
either, but Johnny's back was broken by the falling roof, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is
in critical condition. Darry and Sodapop come to get Ponyboy, and
Darry and Ponyboy make up. The following morning, the newspapers
proclaim Ponyboy and Johnny heroes. They also report that, because
of Bob's death, Johnny will be charged with manslaughter. Finally,
the papers also state that both Ponyboy and Johnny will have to
go to juvenile court so that a judge can decide if they should be
sent to a boys' home. Ponyboy and Two-Bit go to get a Coke and run into Randy. Randy
tells Ponyboy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) is sick of all the fighting and does not plan
to go to the rumble that night. When Ponyboy and Two-Bit visit Johnny
in the hospital, Johnny seems weak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) asks Ponyboy for a new copy
of Gone with the Wind. During their visit with
Dally, Ponyboy and Two-Bit notice that Dally is much stronger than Johnny.
Dally asks to borrow Two-Bit's black-handled switchblade. On the
way home, Two-Bit and Ponyboy see Cherry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) refuses to visit Johnny
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) has killed Bob, and Ponyboy calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) a traitor. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) explains herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) relents. At the rumble, the greasers defeat the Socs. Dally shows
up just in time for the fight; he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) has escaped from the hospital.
After the fight, Ponyboy and Dally hurry back to see Johnny and
find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is dying. When Johnny dies, Dally loses control and
runs from the room in a frenzy. Ponyboy stumbles home late that
night, feeling dazed and disoriented. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) tells the others of Johnny's
death. Dally calls to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) has robbed a grocery store and
the cops are looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>). The greasers hurry to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>), but
they are too late. Dally raises a gun to the police and they gun
him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) down. Overwhelmed, Ponyboy passes out. Ponyboy wakes up in bed at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) has suffered a concussion from
a kick to the head at the rumble and has been delirious in bed for
several days. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) attends his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) hearing, where the judge
treats him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) kindly and acquits him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) of responsibility for Bob's death.
The court rules that Ponyboy will be allowed to remain at home with
Darry. For a time, Ponyboy feels listless and empty. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) grades
slip, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) feels hostile to Darry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) appetite. At last,
Sodapop tells Ponyboy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) -LRB-Sodapop-RRB- is angry and frustrated
because of the tension at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) tearfully asks that Ponyboy and
Darry stop fighting. Finally understanding the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) family,
Ponyboy agrees not to fight with Darry anymore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) finds that for
the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) can remember Dally's and Johnny's deaths without
pain or denial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) decides to tell their story and begins writing
a term paper for his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) English class, which turns out to be the novel itself.
