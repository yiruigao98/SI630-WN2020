beautiful young woman who is brought to tragedy by the wickedness
of her world. The eighteen-year-old Clarissa Harlowe is universally
loved and admired, considered an exemplary woman by everyone around
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The Harlowes are an up-and-coming family, possessing great
wealth but little status. The other members of the family are avaricious
and eager to improve their standing in the world, and Clarissa becomes
the victim of their greed. The trouble starts when Richard Lovelace,
a dashing libertine, comes to pay court to Clarissa's sister, Arabella, but
is attracted by Clarissa instead. Arabella's jealousy combines with
the resentment of their brother, James, who holds a grudge against
Lovelace from college days, and sets the family against him (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>). A duel between the two, in which Lovelace wounds James
but spares his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) life, crystallizes their hatred. The family becomes
suspicious of Clarissa, forbids her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) from corresponding with Lovelace, and
commands her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) to marry a horrible rich man named Roger Solmes. Clarissa
refuses to consider marrying Solmes and carries on a clandestine
correspondence with Lovelace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) also continues to secretly correspond
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) best friend, Anna Howe. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) continues to resist marriage
to Solmes, Clarissa is increasingly confined, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) is barely
able to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) room. Finally Lovelace takes advantage of Clarissa's
fear of a forced marriage by tricking her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) into running away with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>). Once Clarissa has run away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) is in Lovelace's power.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) reputation is ruined and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) family refuses to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>).
Lovelace is an adept manipulator, enjoying the <div class="bookquote">``contrivances''  (<font color='red'><b>Lovelace</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>)
invents to keep Clarissa in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) web. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>), but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) hates the idea of marriage, so his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) goal is to force her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) into
<div class="bookquote">``cohabitation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>rather than marriage. Clarissa is innocent and virtuous
and does not see through Lovelace's tricks. Furthermore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) refuses
to compromise any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) strict tenets of behavior, even to save
herself. Lovelace repeatedly tests Clarissa's virtue as a means
of testing the character of the entire sex: if Clarissa is truly
an exemplary woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) will withstand his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) contrivances and remain
a model of goodness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) intention, however, is to force Clarissa
to compromise her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) strict morals, sully her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) reputation, and gain
full control over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>). Without suspecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) is playing into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) goes with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) to London, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) secures lodgings
at Mrs. Sinclair's house. Clarissa is unaware that this is a brothel
and the women she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) meets there are whores. Having been involved with
-LRB-and ruined by-RRB- Lovelace in the past, these women are jealous of
Clarissa and encourage Lovelace to rape her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>). At the same time, Clarissa's virtue has a powerful effect
on Lovelace and sometimes sways him (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) bad intentions.
After several battles between his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) wicked heart and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) protesting
conscience, Lovelace's joy in intrigue and the whores' instigations
seal Clarissa's doom. Finally suspecting Lovelace's vileness, Clarissa escapes,
but Lovelace finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) and tricks her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) back to Mrs. Sinclair's brothel.
There, Mrs. Sinclair drugs Clarissa and Lovelace rapes her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) is unconscious. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) awakes, Clarissa goes temporarily mad,
and Lovelace regrets his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) action. The rape has failed to put Clarissa
fully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) power because she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) has never compromised her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) virtue.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) begins to talk with more seriousness about marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>), but
also thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) will try to rape her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) again and see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) can get her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>)
consent, thus abandoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) principles. Clarissa, sensing the danger,
runs away, this time successfully. Once Clarissa has been raped, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) stops eating and no
longer worries about worldly problems like reputation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) continues
to seek reconciliation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) family, but they remain adamant.
One of Lovelace's plots gone wrong allows him (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) to accidentally discover Clarissa's
location, but at the same time it damages her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) health and cements
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) wickedness. Lovelace's friend Belford becomes
Clarissa's protector, keeping Lovelace away but mediating between
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) and Clarissa. Lovelace is now truly determined to marry Clarissa,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) prefers the idea of death to that of marrying such a criminal.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) health steadily worsens, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) begins to prepare for death. With remarkable equanimity, Clarissa makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) will, appoints Belford
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) executor, puts her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) affairs in order, and even orders a coffin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>)
finally dies, expressing forgiveness for everyone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) life and joyful
anticipation of heaven. The Harlowes finally see how wrong their
treatment of Clarissa has been. Mr. and Mrs. Harlowe die soon after,
and James and Arabella marry badly and are miserable for the rest
of their lives. Lovelace fails to reform and is killed by Clarissa's cousin
Morden in a duel. Anna, Hickman, Belford, and the other good characters
are rewarded with happy marriages. Belford takes on the project
of collecting the letters that tell Clarissa's story so that it
can be an example to protect other women from similar fates.
