Born the son of a wealthy and sophisticated woman, Beatrice, Amory travels the country with his (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) mother until he (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) attends the fictitious St. Regis prep school in New England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) is handsome, quite intelligent though lazy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) schoolwork, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) earns admission to Princeton. Though initially concerned with being a success on campus, after failing a class he (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) gives himself over to idleness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) prefers to learn through reading and discussions with friends than through his (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) classes. Toward the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) college career, America enters World War I and Amory dutifully enlists, forgoing his (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) degree. During his (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) time overseas, Beatrice passes away. Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) return to America, Amory meets the young debutante Rosalind Connage, the sister of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) college friend Alec. The two fall deeply in love, but because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blaine</b></font>) family's poor investments, Amory has little money, and Rosalind does not wish to marry into poverty. Despite Amory's best efforts to earn money at an advertising agency, Rosalind breaks off their engagement in order to marry a wealthier man, devastating Amory. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes on a three week drinking binge, which is finally terminated by the advent of the Prohibition. Amory's quest for self-knowledge begins to be realized. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a short summer romance with the wild Eleanor. Soon after, Alec is caught with a girl in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) hotel room, and Amory takes the blame. Amory then discovers that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) last close tie, the dear friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) father figure, Monsignor Darcy, has passed away. Further, the family finances have left him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) almost no money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) decides to walk to Princeton and is picked up along the way by the wealthy father of a friend who died in the war. Amory expounds his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) new socialist principles and then continues to walk to Princeton. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arrives late at night, pining for Rosalind. Amory reaches his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands to the sky and says <div class="bookquote">``I know myself, but that is all--''
