Inspired by the <div class="bookquote">``gusts of memory''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that rise up within him (<font color='blue'><b>Marcel</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marcel</b></font>) dips a Madeleine into hot tea, the narrator discusses his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) fear of going to bed at night. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) is a creature of habit and dislikes waking up in the middle of the night not knowing where he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) claims that people are defined by the objects that surround them and must piece together their identities bit by bit each time they wake up. The young Marcel is so nervous about sleeping alone that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marcel</b></font>) looks forward to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marcel</b></font>) mother's goodnight kisses, but also dreads them as a sign of an impending sleepless night. One night, when Charles Swann, a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) grandparents, is visiting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) mother cannot come kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) goodnight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) stays up until Swann leaves and looks so sad and pitiful that even his (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) disciplinarian father encourages <div class="bookquote">``Mamma''  (<font color='red'><b>disciplinarian father</b></font>)</div>to spend the night in Marcel's room. The narrator traces the roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) inclination to become a writer back to Combray. His (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) grandparents and friends encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) to read and introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) to Bergotte, who becomes his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) favorite author. Marcel is awestruck by the overpowering beauty of the landscape around Combray, especially the hawthorn blossoms that line the path to Swann's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) loves to fall asleep in the shade of these blossoms and then walk around the outskirts of Combray, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) can admire the town church. Watching the sun reflect off the roof tiles of the church steeple, Marcel decides to become a writer and describes what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marcel</b></font>) sees to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marcel</b></font>) ability. One day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marcel</b></font>) accidentally comes across an open window at M. Vinteuil's house. A composer, Vinteuil died of a broken heart after his (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) daughter took another woman as her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lover. Marcel spies on the two lovers as they mock the memory of the recently deceased Vinteuil. On a separate walk, Marcel and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marcel</b></font>) family chance across Swann's wife, Odette, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) daughter, Gilberte. Marcel instantly falls in love with Gilberte, but idealizes her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) to such an extent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marcel</b></font>) thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) black eyes are really blue. The novel now carries the reader back fifteen years to relate the second story--that of the love affair between Swann and Odette. Swann does not know that Odette has a terrible reputation and, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) will be harder to seduce than she (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) really is, takes up an interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) only vaguely attractive, however, until one day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) resembles Botticelli's beautiful rendering of Jethro's daughter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) painting Zipporrah. Idealizing Odette through the intermediary of the painting, Swann respects her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) beauty with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) heart and starts to obsess about her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) day and night. Odette introduces Swann to the Verdurins and their nightly salon. At first, they love Swann's company and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) one of their <div class="bookquote">``faithful''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>guests. One night, after failing to see Odette at the Verdurins, Swann looks for her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) all over Paris. When they finally run into each other, their passion ignites and they become lovers. The Verdurins constantly play Vinteuil's sonata, whose piercing violin crescendos make Swann so happy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) fixes an association in his (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) mind between the music and his (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) love for Odette. Nevertheless, Odette quickly begins to tire of Swann, who in turn is hopelessly in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) suspects that she (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) is cheating on him (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) is such an awful liar, but his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) obsession for her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) runs so deep that he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) ignores the truth about their failed romance until there is no turning back: he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) must suffer the tormenting pangs of unrequited love. The Verdurins grow suspicious and jealous of Swann's famous friends, including the Prince of Wales, and begin to push him (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) out of their social circle. Odette begins to cheat on Swann with Forcheville, another of the Verdurins' guests; Swann discovers this infidelity by reading one of Odette's letters to Forcheville. One of Swann's closest friends, Charlus, tries to turn Odette back toward Swann but ends up sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) an anonymous letter about Odette's history of infidelity. Swann finally confronts her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) and learns the truth about her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) torrid sexual escapades. Dumbfounded, Swann retreats back into the high society of aristocrats and royalty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) had enjoyed before meeting Odette. His (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) suffering soon diminishes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) gets used to seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Odette</b></font>) only rarely. One day, after realizing the extent to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) had based his (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) vision of Odette on the idealized version of a Botticelli figure, Swann exclaims disbelief at having experienced the greatest love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) life for a woman who wasn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Swann</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``type.''
