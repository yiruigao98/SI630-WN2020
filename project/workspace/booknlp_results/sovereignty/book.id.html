the Massachusetts Bay Colony, is besieged by Native Americans. The attackers burn
down houses and open fire on the settlers, wounding and killing several of them, and
take a number of the survivors captive. Mary Rowlandson is one of the wounded, as is
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) youngest child, Sarah. Other members of Rowlandson's family are killed outright.
As the melee dies down, the Native Americans begin to lead their captives, including
Rowlandson and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) three children, from the settlement into the surrounding
wilderness. At this point, Rowlandson and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) two elder children are separated, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and the youngest are allowed to remain together. After a night spent in an abandoned town nearby, from which colonists had fled
in fear of Indian attack, the captors and their captives begin to trek westward,
farther into the forest. As Rowlandson and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) daughter are both wounded, the
journey is difficult and painful. After another day of travel, they reach an Indian
settlement called Wenimesset. Here, Rowlandson meets another British captive, Robert
Pepper, who wants to offer the new captives comfort. The Indians and their captives
remain in Wenimesset for over a week, and during this time, Rowlandson's wounded
child becomes more ill, finally dying on February 18. By this time, Rowlandson's
original captor has sold her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to a Saggamore Indian named Quannopin, who is related
by marriage to King Philip. Quannopin oversees the burial of Rowlandson's dead
child, and a grieving Rowlandson visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) elder daughter -LRB-also named Mary-RRB-, who
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) learns is also being held in Wenimesset. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) despairs over the fate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
family, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) son visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has been allowed to come from the nearby Indian
settlement where he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is being held in captivity. Meanwhile, the Indians continue to
attack British towns, including Medfield, killing and looting as they go. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
captors give Rowlandson a Bible, part of the spoils of Medfield, and in it she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) finds
comfort and hope. After the fighting at Medfield, the Indians decide again to <div class="bookquote">``remove''  (<font color='red'><b>the Indians</b></font>)</div>westward,
now heading north as well. Rowlandson is again separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) family and
acquaintances. After a four-day rest in the forest, the band of Indians with whom
Rowlandson is traveling begins to travel more swiftly. Rowlandson suspects that the
British army must be close. They reach the Baquaug River and cross it, and the
English arrive close behind. The British soldiers, however, are unable to ford the
river, and the Indians and Rowlandson continue to the northwest. Rowlandson and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
captors soon reach the Connecticut River, which they plan to cross in order to meet
with King Philip. Here, however, are English scouts, and the Indians and Rowlandson
are forced to scatter in the forest to remain undetected. Rowlandson again meets up
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) son and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) captors, though they must soon part ways. After this detour, Rowlandson and the Indians cross the river, and on the
other side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) meets with King Philip as planned. For some time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remains at
this settlement, sewing clothes for the Indians in return for food. The Indians,
meanwhile, raid Northampton and return with spoils, including horses. Rowlandson
asks to be taken to Albany on horseback, hoping that there she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will be <div class="bookquote">``sold''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in
exchange for gunpowder, but instead, the Indians prepare to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) northward and
over the river once more. After a brief sojourn at a settlement five miles north of King Philip's abode,
Rowlandson's captors once again bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) north but then turn south again.
Rowlandson hopes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'ll be returned home, but the Indians delay the journey,
continuing south down the Connecticut River rather than turning east toward
civilization. Indian attacks on British towns continue, and another captive, Thomas
Read, joins Rowlandson's group. From Read, Rowlandson learns that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband is
alive and well, which heartens her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Rowlandson also sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) son again, briefly.
Rowlandson and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) captors finally begin to move east. They again cross the Baquaug River. Messengers meet them and report that
Rowlandson must go to Wachuset, where the Indians will meet to discuss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) possible
return to freedom. More hopeful than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has been in some time, Rowlandson eagerly
sets off toward the council's meeting place. But the journey tires her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is
disheartened by the sight of an injured colonist, wounded in still another Indian
attack. At Wachuset, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) speaks with King Philip, who promises her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'ll be free in
two weeks. Nonetheless, the council continues to deliberate, asking Rowlandson how
much her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband would be willing to pay them as ransom. The Indians then send a
letter to Boston, stating that Rowlandson can be redeemed for twenty pounds.
Meanwhile, attacks on British settlements continue, including an attack on Sudbury,
after which Rowlandson must travel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) captors back into the forest. As the Indians celebrate their victories, messengers arrive from the council,
along with an Englishman named John Hoar. Rowlandson hopes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'ll be allowed to
leave with Hoar, but negotiations continue for several more days. Rowlandson is
finally allowed to travel back to now-abandoned Lancaster, then on to Concord, and
finally to Boston. After nearly twelve weeks in the wilderness, Rowlandson is
reunited with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband. The two stay with a friend in Concord for eleven weeks,
during which time Rowlandson's sister is also released from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) captivity.
Rowlandson's son and daughter are eventually returned as well. The family,
together again at last, sets up a new household in Boston, where they continue
to live until 1677.
