The Time Traveller produces a miniature time machine and makes it disappear into thin air. The next week, the guests return, to find their host stumble in, looking disheveled and tired. They sit down after dinner, and the Time Traveller begins his (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) story. The Time Traveller had finally finished work on his (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) time machine, and it rocketed him (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) into the future. When the machine stops, in the year 802,701 AD, he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) finds himself in a paradisiacal world of small humanoid creatures called Eloi. They are frail and peaceful, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) fruit to eat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) explores the area, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) returns he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) finds that his (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) time machine is gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) decides that it has been put inside the pedestal of a nearby statue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) tries to pry it open but cannot. In the night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) begins to catch glimpses of strange white ape-like creatures the Eloi call Morlocks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) decides that the Morlocks live below ground, down the wells that dot the landscape. Meanwhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) saves one of the Eloi from drowning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) befriends him (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) name is Weena. The Time Traveller finally works up enough courage to go down into the world of Morlocks to try to retrieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) time machine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) finds that matches are a good defense against the Morlocks, but ultimately they chase him (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) out of their realm. Frightened by the Morlocks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) takes Weena to try to find a place where they will be safe from the Morlocks' nocturnal hunting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) goes to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) calls the Palace of Green Porcelain, which turns out to be a museum. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) finds more matches, some camphor, and a lever he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) can use as a weapon. That night, retreating from the Morlocks through a giant wood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) accidentally starts a fire. Many Morlocks die in the fire and the battle that ensues, and Weena is killed. The exhausted Time Traveller returns to the pedestal to find that it has already been pried open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) strides in confidently, and just when the Morlocks think that they have trapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) springs onto the machine and whizzes into the future. The Time Traveller makes several more stops. In a distant time he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) stops on a beach where he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) is attacked by giant crabs. The bloated red sun sits motionless in the sky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) then travels thirty million years into the future. The air is very thin, and the only sign of life is a black blob with tentacles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) sees a planet eclipse the sun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) then returns, exhausted, to the present time. The next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) leaves again, but never returns.
