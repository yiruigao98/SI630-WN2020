Before being chosen Ender wears a unique monitor that allows the heads of the military to see things as Ender does. Ender's brother Peter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sister Valentine also wore this monitor, although neither was selected, nor did they have it for as long as Ender, and Peter will never forgive Ender for this. Peter hates Ender, and even when the monitor is taken out it does nothing to decrease Peter's anger. The same is true of Ender's schoolmates, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) is forced into brutally beating the leader of a gang of bullies in order to protect himself. Although Valentine tries to protect Ender from Peter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) is only saved from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) brother when Colonel Graff of the International Fleet comes to take Ender away to Battle School. Ender leaves behind Valentine, who loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>), in order to help save the world from the buggers. Battle School is located on a ship far from earth. On the flight there Ender demonstrates his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) ability to brilliantly visualize gravitational effects, and Graff begins to isolate him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) fellow classmates. Ender lives with the new recruits, called Launchies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) makes a few friends among the recruits and ends his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) isolation, although his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) brilliance will never cease causing resentment. Inside the battleroom, Ender figures out how to maneuver in null gravity, along with another recruit named Alai. Ender and Alai become friends, and this helps Ender fit in with the rest of the group. Ender manages to get farther in one of the computer games, called the mind game, than anyone ever had before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>), and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) does not know, the military commanders take notice. Ender is abruptly promoted to Salamander Army. There Ender is befriended by Petra Arkanian, the only girl in the army. The army commander, Bonzo Madrid, does not like Ender and does not want him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) around. Ender practices with Petra and begins to teach his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) launch group what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) knows. Ender helps the army by disobeying Bonzo, who hates Ender, but fortunately Ender is traded to Rat Army. Ender is put in Dink Meeker's platoon. Dink is an excellent toon leader, and Ender does well in battles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) continues teaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) Launchies, even though this causes resentment among other soldiers. Ender gets into a fight and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) hurts four older boys who attack him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>). It is clear to Ender that the teachers are leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) to fend for himself. Meanwhile, Peter has convinced Valentine that it is time for them to assert themselves. Peter has unlimited ambition, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is intelligent enough to try to manipulate world events. Valentine agrees to work with him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) wants their impact to be a positive one. Disguised on the information networks they soon begin to exert an influence. By this time Ender is nine years old and a platoon leader in Phoenix Army under Petra's command. Everyone respects his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) brilliance and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) practice sessions are attended by many, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) is depressed and is stuck in the mind game. Colonel Graff comes to visit Valentine and has her (<font color='blue'><b>Petra</b></font>) write Ender a letter. The memory of Valentine helps Ender to ground himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) is able to continue on in the mind game, which is a great relief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) teachers. Ender is made commander of Dragon Army and given a group of soldiers, most of them Launchies. The smallest one, Bean, is very bright and precocious, much like Ender was, and Bean proves his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) mettle in practice sessions. Ender's army is given an unprecedented number of battles to face, with advantages given to the enemies, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) wins every one. Each toon of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) army acts as an independent unit, and this revolutionizes battleroom strategy. Bonzo is humiliated when Ender beats him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>). Bonzo attacks Ender in the shower room and Ender beats him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>), brutally, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) was forced to. Ender is then transferred out of Battle School to Command School. The authorities figured out Valentine and Peter's actions but have decided to leave them alone. Valentine visits Ender while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) is given a brief vacation, and it is clear that things have changed between them. Graff takes Ender to Eros, the planet that holds the International Fleet command, and there Ender is introduced to Mazer Rackham, the hero of the second bugger invasion, who saved mankind. Rackham runs Ender through a series of simulated battles, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) now commands an entire fleet. Ender learns that the buggers are like highly evolved insects and they communicate instantaneously--their queen thinks for all of them. Ender begins having strange dreams about the buggers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) fights more and more difficult battles and one day fights a huge battle against impossible odds with many officers watching. Ender wins, at great cost, and it becomes apparent that it was a real battle, as were all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) supposedly simulated battles, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) completely destroyed the buggers. Ender was used, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) knows it, as do his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) teachers, but they explain that they needed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>), a child, to have the compassion to understand the enemy. At the same time they needed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) to think it was a game in order to be able to win with such great loss of life. Peter has taken over control of the world and Valentine convinces Ender to set off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) on a colonization mission to populate the worlds left behind by the buggers. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) goes Ender learns that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) did killed Bonzo as well as the bully back in school. On the new planet Ender finds an area that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) realizes looks just like the mind game and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) realizes that the buggers had prepared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) coming--they had looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) mind and knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) would defeat them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) finds a queen pupa, left behind for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) to find a place for the buggers to live again. Ender can think to the queen, and sees that the buggers did not truly wish to fight the humans and feels their sorrow for all that happens. Ender decides to make it his (<font color='blue'><b>Ender</b></font>) mission to find a place for the buggers to live.
