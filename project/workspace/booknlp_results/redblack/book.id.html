Pirard (4) <br />4	Mathilde (4) <br />2	M. de Rênal (2) <br /><h1>Text</h1><p/>M. de Rênal, the mayor of the provincial town Verrières, hires Julien Sorel to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) children's tutor. Julien is only a carpenter's son, but dreams of following in the footsteps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) hero, Napoleon. However, in Julien's time, men gain power in the Church and not in the army. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) is training to become a priest, Julien decides to seduce the mayor's wife, Mme. de Rênal, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) thinks that it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) duty. They become lovers, but M. Valenod, the mayor's political adversary, finds out about the affair and begins to spread rumors. M. de Rênal is profoundly embarrassed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) wife convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) that the rumors are false. M. Chélan, the town priest and Julien's mentor, sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) to the Besançon seminary to avoid any further scandal. The director of the seminary, M. Pirard, likes Julien and encourages him (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) to become a great priest. Julien does very well at the seminary, but only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) wants to make a fortune and succeed in French society. The other priests at the seminary are not aware of Julien's hypocrisy, but are jealous of his (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) intelligence. M. Pirard is disgusted with the political involvement of the Church and resigns. His (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) aristocratic benefactor, the Marquis de la Mole, wants M. Pirard to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Mole</b></font>) personal secretary in Paris, but M. Pirard tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Mole</b></font>) to hire Julien instead. Julien is both enthralled and repulsed by Parisian society at the same time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) tries to fit in among the nobles but they treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) as a social inferior. However, the Marquis's daughter, Mathilde, falls in love with Julien and they become lovers. When Mathilde gets pregnant and tells the Marquis about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) affair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is furious, but soon ennobles Julien so Mathilde can marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>). Julien finally has the aristocratic title he (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) always wanted. But Mme. de Rênal sends the Marquis a letter denouncing Julien as a womanizer only concerned with making his (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) fortune. The Marquis then refuses to let Mathilde marry Julien, who furiously returns to Verrières and shoots Mme. de Rênal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) survives, but Julien is sentenced to death anyway. Mme. de Rênal forgives Julien and dies of love three days after his (<font color='blue'><b>Julien</b></font>) execution.
