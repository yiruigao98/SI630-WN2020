by the devil and that her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) Uncle Marcos's body was delivered to her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
house accompanied by a puppy, Barrabás, Clara del Valle began keeping
a journal. Fifty years later, her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) husband Esteban and her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) granddaughter
Alba refer to these journals as they piece together the story of their
family. Clara is a young girl when Barrabás arrives at the del
Valle house. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) favorite sister, Rosa the Beautiful, is engaged
to Esteban Trueba. Clara is clairvoyant and is able to predict almost
every event in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is not able to change the future, only
to see it. While Esteban is off in the mines trying to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>)
fortune, Rosa is accidentally poisoned in the place of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) father,
Severo del Valle. Rosa dies. Clara is so shocked by the events that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stops talking. Nine years later, Esteban has made a fortune
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) family property, Tres Marias, thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) hard work and
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) exploitation of the local peasants. On top of exploiting
their labor, Esteban exploits all of the young girls of the peasant
families, notably Pancha, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) sexual satisfaction. In addition
to the peasant girls, Esteban also has sexual relations with prostitutes,
including Transito Soto. Transito and Esteban become friends, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) lends her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) money to move to the city. Esteban's mother is about
to die, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) returns to the city, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) pays a visit to the
del Valle home. Esteban and Clara become engaged and marry. They
move into the big house on the corner that Esteban built for them.
Esteban's sister Ferula moves in with them. About a year after they are married, Clara and Esteban's
first child, Blanca, is born. When the family travels to Tres Marias
for the summer a few years later, Blanca meets Pedro Tercero and
they fall in love. Pedro Tercero is the son of Pedro Segundo, the
peasant foreman of Tres Marias. Toward the end of the summer, Clara
becomes pregnant again with twins, who she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) announces will be named
Jaime and Nicolas. Days before the twins are due, Clara's parents
are killed in a car accident. Rescuers are unable to find Nivea's
head. No one wants to tell Clara that Nivea is buried headless,
because they do not want to upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) just before the birth. Clara,
however, realizes that her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mother's head has not been found and
makes Ferula go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to find it. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) recovers her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
mother's head, Clara goes into labor. Over the years, Ferula and
Clara have developed a deep friendship. Ferula's feelings for Clara
border on passionate love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) and Esteban develop a rivalry
over Clara's affections. One morning, Esteban comes home unexpectedly
and finds Ferula in Clara's bed. Esteban kicks Ferula out of the
house. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) leaves, Ferula curses Esteban to eternal loneliness. Blanca and Pedro Tercero's love grows as they mature,
and they soon realize that Esteban would disapprove if he (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) knew.
In addition to their being of different classes, Pedro Tercero is
a revolutionary, while Esteban is a conservative. Blanca and Pedro
Tercero continue their romance in secret. Several years later, they
are exposed to Esteban by Jean de Satigny, who is trying to ingratiate
himself with Esteban so he (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) can become either his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) business partner
or his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) son-in-law. Esteban makes Blanca leave Tres Marias and tries
to kill Pedro Tercero. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) anger, Esteban hits Clara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) never
talks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) again. For several years although they live in the
same house, they almost never see each other. Jaime and Nicolas
finish boarding school and return home. Jaime studies medicine and
Nicolas dabbles in spirituality and inventing. Esteban becomes very
involved in the Conservative party, runs for Senate, and is elected.
Esteban and Clara eventually return to a civil, if silent, relationship. A few years later, Blanca gets pregnant. Esteban tells
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanca</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) has killed Pedro Tercero and forces her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanca</b></font>) to marry Jean
de Satigny. About six months after they are married, Blanca discovers
Jean de Satigny's unusual sexual practices and leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Satigny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Blanca</b></font>) gives
birth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanca</b></font>) daughter Alba as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanca</b></font>) arrives home at the big
house on the corner. Miguel, the younger brother of a friend and
lover of Nicolas and Jaime, watches Alba's birth from a closet. According to Clara, Alba is born lucky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is raised
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) entire family, inspiring great love in all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is the only
member of the family to develop a close and loving relationship
with Esteban. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) thinks that Jean de Satigny is her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) father
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) is dead, Alba meets Pedro Tercero and establishes a
friendship with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tercero</b></font>). To the great sadness of everyone but herself,
Clara dies. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is eighteen, Alba enters the university where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) meets Miguel, and they fall in love. Miguel is a revolutionary.
They participate in some of the growing number of anti-conservative
protests that are springing up around the country. To everyone's surprise, the socialists win the elections.
Pedro Tercero joins the government. The peasants take over Tres
Marias. Esteban tries to stop them and is taken hostage. At Blanca's
request, Pedro Tercero intervenes and saves Esteban. Esteban and
the conservatives do all they can to discredit the socialists, including
preparing to a military coup. A few months later, there is a military coup.
Jaime, who is friends with the Socialist president, is killed. Miguel
joins the guerrillas, and Pedro Tercero goes into hiding in the big
house on the corner. Esteban is at first pleases with the coup but soon
realizes that it results not in the conservatives' return to power, but
in the establishment of a military dictatorship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) is powerless to
do much other than to help Blanca and Pedro Tercero escape to Canada. The colonel at the head of the dictatorship abducts Alba.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tercero</b></font>) turns out to be Esteban Garcia, Pancha and Esteban Trueba's grandson.
Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alba</b></font>) died Pancha told Esteban the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) ancestry. Esteban
slowly made his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) way up the ranks of the military, in the process
acquainted himself with Esteban Trueba and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esteban</b></font>) family, especially
Alba. Under the guise of finding out where Miguel is, Esteban Garcia
exacts revenge on Alba for his (<font color='blue'><b>Garcia</b></font>) grandmother's mistreatment. Desperate
to find Alba, Esteban turns to Transito Soto, who runs the Christopher
Columbus, a brothel-turned-hotel. Thanks to the connections she (<font color='blue'><b>Alba</b></font>)
has established through her (<font color='blue'><b>Alba</b></font>) sex work, Transito is able to repay
the favor Esteban did for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alba</b></font>) years before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alba</b></font>) assures that
Alba is returned home. Alba and Esteban have just begun to write
the story of their family when Esteban dies. Alba carries forth the
project, pregnant with a child who's father is either Miguel or one
of the men who raped her (<font color='blue'><b>Alba</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alba</b></font>) was in detention.
