Christine, the cook, is frying something when Jean, a valet, enters, exclaiming that Miss Julie is wild tonight. He (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) danced with Miss Julie, the Count's daughter, at the local barn. Christine observes that Miss Julie has been rambunctious in the wake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) broken engagement. According to Jean, Miss Julie's fiancé abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) after she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) attempted to train him (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>), making him (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) jump over her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) riding whip in the barnyard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) beat him (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>). Miss Julie appears in the doorway, and Jean becomes polite and charming. Julie invites him (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) to dance. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) hesitates, warning her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) against the dangers of local gossip, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) goes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) to the party. A pantomime ensues in which Christine cleans the kitchen. Jean and Julie return and flirt more. Christine falls asleep next to the stove. Under Julie's orders, Jean kneels in mock gallantry and kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) foot. In a dream, Miss Julie declares that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``climbing down''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>from her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) social position. Jean has dreamed the opposite, yearning to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) status. Julie asks Jean if he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) has ever been in love. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) that as a child, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) got sick with love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) grew up on a wasteland. The Count's lovely garden was visible from his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) window. One day while weeding the onion beds, Jean caught sight of a <div class="bookquote">``Turkish pavilion'' (<font color='red'><b>Jean</b></font>)</div>--that is, an outhouse. Enchanted by its beauty, Jean snuck in but soon heard someone coming. Trapped, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) fled through the bottom of the outhouse until coming upon a rose terrace, where Miss Julie was walking. Lovelorn, Jean watched Julie walk among the roses. The following Sunday, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) went to church, determined to see Miss Julie once more, and then attempted suicide. Moved, Julie asks Jean to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) out to the lake. Again, Jean warns her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) of the injury to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) reputation. Suddenly the guests are heard approaching. Jean tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) that they are singing a dirty song about them and suggests that they flee to his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) room. They exit. The peasants dance around the kitchen. Julie and Jean return to the kitchen. The implication is that they have had sex. Gesturing toward the rumor-mongering crowd, Jean declares it is impossible to stay at the manor. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) dreams of traveling to northern Italy and setting up a hotel. Julie begs Jean to declare his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) has fallen for him (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>). Abruptly, Jean declares that behave coolly, as if nothing has happened. Julie points out that he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) needs capital to open a hotel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) has not a penny to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) name. Jean says that in that case, the plans are off. Julie becomes hysterical, wondering how can she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) live with everyone sneering behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) back. Jean is unsympathetic, calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) a whore and revealing that his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) story of the rose terrace was a lie. Crushed, Julie says she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) deserves his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) abuse. Jean proposes anew that they flee together. Julie wants to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) life first. Believing in the independence of women, Julie's mother brought the estate to ruin. When Julie's father finally took command, her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) mother fell ill. A mysterious fire then burned down the estate. Julie's mother suggested to Julie's father that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should borrow money from a friend of hers to rebuild the farm. Jean says that Julie's mother set the fire, and the friend was her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) lover. Julie took her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) mother's side and grew up to hate men as her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) mother did. Jean tires of Julie's talk, and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) is sick. Julie begs him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) what to do. Terrified of the consequences with the Count, Jean commands her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) to flee. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) exits to prepare for her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) departure. Christine enters, reminding Jean that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) promised to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) at church. This morning's sermon is on the beheading of John the Baptist. Jean confesses to sleeping with Julie. Disgusted, Christine decides that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) cannot remain in the house. Suddenly the two hear sounds upstairs: the Count has come back. Christine exits. The sun rises, breaking the spell of Midsummer's Eve. Dressed for travel, Julie appears with a small birdcage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) begs Jean to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) agrees, but insists that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) leave the canary behind, offering to kill it. Jean decapitates the bird on a chopping block. <div class="bookquote">``Kill me too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Julie/Miss Julie</b></font>)</div>screams Julie. Julie approaches the chopping block, mesmerized. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) exclaims that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) wants to see Jean's head on a chopping block and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entire sex swimming in blood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) pledges to stay, to wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) father and confess everything. The Count will die of shame. Christine enters, and Julie begs her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) for help. Christine refuses. Desperate, Julie has an idea: the three of them can flee together and open that hotel. Christine speaks of their redemption, saying the last shall be first. Christine leaves, promising to tell the stable boy to stop any attempted departures on their part. Utterly defeated, Julie asks Jean what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would do if in her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) picks up Jean's shaving razor and slashes the air, saying <div class="bookquote">``Like this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jean</b></font>)</div>The bell rings twice; it is the Count. Exhausted, Miss Julie begs Jean to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>), saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) will obey him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as a dog would if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) helps save her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) father from disgrace. Jean is immobilized by the sound of the Count's voice. Julie tells him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to pretend that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is the Count, and to hypnotize her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>). Jean whispers the fatal instructions in her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) ear. Julie asks Jean to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) that the first will receive the gift of grace. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cannot promise grace but tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) is definitely among the last. The bell rings twice, and Jean commands Julie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julie</b></font>) walks out the door.
