factory in the world, has decided to open the doors of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) factory
to five lucky children and their parents. In order to choose who
will enter the factory, Mr. Wonka devises a plan to hide five golden
tickets beneath the wrappers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wonka</b></font>) famous chocolate bars. The search
for the five golden tickets is fast and furious. Augustus Gloop,
a corpulent child whose only hobby is eating, unwraps the first
ticket, for which his (<font color='blue'><b>Wonka</b></font>) town throws him (<font color='blue'><b>Wonka</b></font>) a parade. Veruca Salt, an
insufferable brat, receives the next ticket from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gloop</b></font>) father, who
had employed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entire factory of peanut shellers to unwrap chocolate
bars until they found a ticket. Violet Beauregarde discovers the
third ticket while taking a break from setting a world record in
gum chewing. The fourth ticket goes to Mike Teavee, who, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Teavee</b></font>)
name implies, cares only about television. Charlie Bucket, the unsuspecting hero of the book, defies
all odds in claiming the fifth and final ticket. A poor but virtuous
boy, Charlie lives in a tiny house with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Bucket, and all four of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) grandparents. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) grandparents share
the only bed in the house, located in the only bedroom, and Charlie
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) parents sleep on mattresses on the floor. Charlie gets three
sparse meals a day, which is hardly enough to nourish a growing
boy, As a result, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is almost sickly thin. Once a year, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
birthday, Charlie gets one bar of Wonka chocolate, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) savors
over many months. The Bucket family's circumstances become all the
more dire when Mr. Bucket loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) job. But a tremendous stroke
of luck befalls Charlie when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) spots a raggedy dollar bill buried
in the snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) decides to use a little of the money to buy himself
some chocolate before turning the rest over to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mother. After
inhaling the first bar of chocolate, Charlie decides to buy just
one more and within the wrapping finds the fifth golden ticket.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is not a moment too soon: the next day is the date Mr. Wonka
has set for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wonka</b></font>) guests to enter the factory. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Bucket can accompany Charlie to the
factory. Mr. Bucket must search for work to put food on the table
and Mrs. Bucket must care for the invalided grandparents. Magically, Charlie's
oldest and most beloved grandparent, Grandpa Joe, springs out of
bed for the first time in decades. Charlie's lucky find has transformed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) into an energetic and almost childlike being. Grandpa Joe and
Charlie set out on their adventure. In the factory, Charlie and Grandpa Joe marvel at the
unbelievable sights, sounds, and especially smells of the factory.
Whereas they are grateful toward and respectful of Mr. Wonka and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wonka</b></font>) factory, the other four children succumb to their own character
flaws. Accordingly, they are ejected from the factory in mysterious
and painful fashions. Augustus Gloop falls into the hot chocolate river--while
attempting to drink it--and is sucked up by one of the many pipes.
Veruca Salt is determined to be a <div class="bookquote">``bad nut''  (<font color='red'><b>Violet Beauregarde</b></font>)</div>by nut-judging squirrels
who throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gloop</b></font>) out with the trash. Violet Beauregarde impetuously
grabs an experimental piece of gum and chews herself into a giant
blueberry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beauregarde</b></font>) is consequently removed from the factory. With the
hope of being on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) beloved television, Mike Teavee shrinks himself,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Teavee</b></font>) father has to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Teavee</b></font>) out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Teavee</b></font>) breast pocket. During
each child's fiasco, Mr. Wonka alienates the parents with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wonka</b></font>) nonchalant
reaction to the child's seeming demise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wonka</b></font>) remains steadfast in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wonka</b></font>) belief that everything will work out in the end. After each child's trial, the Oompa-Loompas beat drums
and sing a moralizing song about the downfalls of greedy, spoiled
children. When only Charlie remains, Willy Wonka turns to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) and congratulates
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) for winning. The entire day has been another contest, the prize
for which is the entire chocolate factory, which Charlie has just
won. Charlie, Grandpa Joe, and Mr. Wonka enter the great glass elevator,
which explodes through the roof of the factory and crashes down
through the roof of Charlie's house, where they collect the rest
of the Bucket family.
