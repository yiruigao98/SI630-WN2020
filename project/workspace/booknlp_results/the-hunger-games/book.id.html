who will take part in the Hunger Games. Her mother and little sister, Prim, sleep
nearby. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Her</b></font>) father died in a mine explosion years earlier. She (<font color='blue'><b>Her</b></font>) goes hunting in the woods
outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Her</b></font>) district, District 12, with Gale, her (<font color='blue'><b>Her</b></font>) best friend. That night, at the
reaping ceremony, the mayor gives a speech describing how the governments of North
America collapsed and the country of Panem rose up in their place. A war ensued between
the Capitol and the districts. The Capitol won, and as a reminder of their defeat, the
Capitol holds the Hunger Games every year. The mayor then introduces Haymitch Abernathy,
District 12's only living Hunger-Games winner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>)'s so drunk he (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) ends up falling in
his (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) own vomit. The district's female tribute is chosen, and to Katniss's horror, it's Prim.
Katniss volunteers immediately in Prim's place. Then the male tribute is selected. It's
Peeta Mellark, and Katniss remembers how years earlier, while searching for food for her (<font color='blue'><b>Capitol</b></font>)
family in the garbage bins behind the town shops, Peeta gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Capitol</b></font>) bread from his (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) family's
bakery. Katniss credits him (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) with saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Capitol</b></font>) that day. Katniss and Peeta say goodbye to
their friends and families and board a train for the Capitol. During the trip, she (<font color='blue'><b>Capitol</b></font>) and
Peeta convince Haymitch, their mentor in the Games and the person responsible for
getting them gifts from sponsors, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) duties seriously. Once there, Katniss meets with her (<font color='blue'><b>Capitol</b></font>) stylist, Cinna, who is designing her (<font color='blue'><b>Capitol</b></font>) dress for
the opening ceremony. At the ceremony, Katniss and Peeta wear simple black outfits lit
with synthetic flames. The outfits are a huge hit with the audience and make Katniss and
Peeta stand out among the tributes. The next day, Katniss and Peeta attend group
training, and the tributes from rich districts who have trained for the Games their
whole lives, called Career Tributes, show off their skills. Later, the tributes are
interviewed by Caesar Flickerman, a television host. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) interview, Peeta reveals
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>)'s had a crush on Katniss for several years. Finally the time comes. From a small underground room, Katniss is lifted into the
arena and the Games officially begin. All the tributes are there, and in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) is
the Cornucopia, which houses an abundance of supplies. Rather than fight, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) runs away
as Haymitch advised. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hikes all day before making camp. After dark, someone starts a
fire nearby, and it isn't long before a pack of Career Tributes arrives and kills the
person. To Katniss's shock, Peeta is with them. The next day Katniss goes in search of
water. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) walks for hours and collapses from exhaustion, but ultimately she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) finds a
stream. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)'s woken in the night by a wall of fire moving in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) direction, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
runs away one of the numerous fireballs falling around her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) grazes her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) leg, injuring
it. That night, while she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hides in a tree from the pack of Careers below, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) notices
a young girl named Rue from District 11 in a nearby tree. Rue points out a nest of
tracker jackers, wasps engineered by the Capitol to be lethal, over Katniss's head, and
Katniss cuts the branch holding the nest, dropping it onto the Careers. Two of them die
from the stings and the rest scatter. Katniss is stung a few times as well, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)'s
running away, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) remembers one of the girls who died had a bow and arrows, the weapons
she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)'s become proficient with from hunting. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) runs back to retrieve them, and Peeta
happens to arrive as she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)'s grabbing the bow. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) yells at Katniss to run just as Cato, a
very large and dangerous Career from District 2, shows up. Peeta stops him (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) so Katniss
can escape, and she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) passes out in a ditch shortly after. Katniss encounters Rue again, and the two quickly form a bond. They are able to
get food hunting and foraging, and Katniss realizes that the Careers would have
difficulty surviving without the supplies at the Cornucopia, so she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and Rue devise a
plan. While Rue lights decoy fires, Katniss sneaks up to the Cornucopia. The supplies
are in a pyramid away from the main camp, and after the Careers leave to investigate the
fires, Katniss manages to blow up the supplies by cutting open a bag of apples with her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
arrows, which sets off the mines set to protect the pyramid. When Katniss doesn't find
Rue at their meeting spot, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) goes looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and finds her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) just as another
tribute stabs her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) with a spear. Katniss kills the other tribute, and when Rue dies, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
covers her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) body in flowers. Katniss is depressed all the next day, until an announcement is made that there
has been a rule change: Now, two tributes from the same district can be declared
winners. Katniss goes looking for Peeta, and it takes her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) a day but finally she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) finds
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rue</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rue</b></font>)'s severely injured from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rue</b></font>) fight with Cato and can barely walk, but Katniss
helps him (<font color='blue'><b>Rue</b></font>) to a cave where they'll be hidden. Thinking Peeta may die, Katniss impulsively
kisses him (<font color='blue'><b>Rue</b></font>). A moment later she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hears a noise outside and finds a pot of broth sent from
Haymitch. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) realizes that Haymitch will reward her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) for playing up the romance between
her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and Peeta. The next morning Katniss sees that Peeta's leg is badly infected and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rue</b></font>)'ll die without treatment. Another announcement is made, this time saying each tribute
will find an item they desperately need at the Cornucopia. Katniss knows that means
medicine for Peeta's leg, but Peeta thinks it's too dangerous and doesn't want Katniss
to go. Using a sleep syrup sent from Haymitch, Katniss knocks him (<font color='blue'><b>Rue</b></font>) out. At the Cornucopia, Katniss tries to run and grab the item marked for District 12,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) gets into a fight with a female tribute. The tribute is about to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) when
Thresh, the male tribute from District 11 who came to the Games with Rue, kills the girl
instead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rue</b></font>) spares Katniss because of the way she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) treated Rue, and Katniss makes it back
to the cave. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) injects Peeta with the medicine just before passing out. They stay
there for a few days while it rains nonstop outside, and in this time the romance
between Katniss and Peeta progresses. When the rain lets up, Peeta and Katniss need to
find food. Katniss leaves Peeta in charge of foraging while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) goes to hunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes
back hours later and finds a small pile of poisonous berries Peeta collected thinking
they were safe. They discover the body of a tribute who Katniss nicknamed Foxface, and
Katniss realizes she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) died from eating the berries. By this point Cato, who killed
Thresh, is the only tribute left, and Katniss decides to keep some berries in case they
can trick Cato the same way. Eventually the streams and ponds dry up, and they know the
only source of water left is the lake near the Cornucopia. Without any other choice,
they start walking to the lake. By the lake, Cato comes suddenly barreling toward them. Unexpectedly, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>)
runs straight by them. Katniss realizes there are strange creatures chasing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>), and
they all run to the Cornucopia and climb up. The creatures are mutant wolves engineered
by the Capitol, and Katniss realizes they are actually the dead tributes, who have been
turned into these monsters. Taking advantage of the situation, Cato attacks Peeta, but
Katniss and Peeta manage to push him (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) over the edge. The creatures overpower him (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>), but
because of the body armor he (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>)'s wearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) remains alive for hours, until Katniss shoots
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) out of pity. Just as Katniss and Peeta think they've won, another announcement is
made that there can only be one winner again. Neither Katniss nor Peeta will kill the
other, so Katniss takes out the poisonous berries. Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) and Peeta pop them in
their mouths, the announcer shouts for them to stop and declares them both
winners. They go back to the Training Center and Katniss is kept alone for days while she (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>)
recuperates. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) is let out, Haymitch warns her (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>)'s in danger. The Capitol
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) stunt with the berries as an act of defiance, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) has to convince everyone
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) was desperate at the thought of losing Peeta and not being rebellious, or even
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) family could be at risk. In their final interview, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>)'s reunited with Peeta, who
lost his (<font color='blue'><b>announcer</b></font>) leg and now has a prosthetic. After, when Haymitch tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) did great,
Peeta wonders what he (<font color='blue'><b>announcer</b></font>) means, and Katniss explains everything, including the romance
strategy during the Games. Peeta is angry and hurt, but as they arrive back in District
12, they hold hands one more time to greet the crowd and cameras.
