narrator, James, waking up on an airplane with no idea where he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
is going. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) has a hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) cheek, four broken teeth, and a broken
nose. James eventually finds out that the plane is bound for Chicago
and that a doctor and two unidentified men brought him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) on board.
James lands to find his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) parents, who have come all the way from
Tokyo to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) up, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). James's condition shocks
and saddens them, and they immediately drive him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to the family cabin.
They next day, they check him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) into a rehabilitation facility in
Minnesota. Almost immediately after arrival, another patient pulls
James to the floor when James refuses to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) seat in the
lounge. Things improve somewhat when James meets a young woman named
Lilly at the dispensary and a friendly, middle-aged career criminal
named Leonard at a meal. Both become his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) friends. Near-constant vomiting and pain mark James's early days
at the clinic. To fix his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) broken teeth, James submits himself to
a horrific double root canal without Novocain. James decides that
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) condition is hopeless and walks out of the clinic, but Leonard
follows him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) and convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) to stay. James's brother Bob and two
friends show up at the clinic unexpectedly for visiting day and
bring some gifts. This show of kindness moves James deeply. After
Bob leaves, James's parents call him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) and ask if he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'ll do the Family
Program, during which they would come to the clinic and engage in
counseling sessions with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) doesn't want them to come.
James begins reading the Tao Te Ching, and it greatly
inspires him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). For once, James has found something that makes sense
to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), something that speaks of self-reliance. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) knows
that the clinic staff is trying to help him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) cannot accept the
Twelve Step method of recovery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) refuses to complete any of
the tasks they set before him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). One evening, Leonard sits down with James and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
a heart-wrenching story about his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) upbringing and how he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) landed in the
clinic. Near the end of the story, Leonard breaks down and cries in
front of James, and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``hold on.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>From this point onward,
James has a deep respect for Leonard, and the notion of holding
on resonates deeply with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). In the cafeteria, Lilly slides James
a scrap of paper, which tells him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Lilly</b></font>) in the clearing outside
of the clinic. This is the start of the love affair between James and
Lilly, a relationship they pursue though the clinic's rules state that
men and women patients cannot interact with each other. James and
Lilly often meet for long periods of time, kissing, holding each
other, and talking. The relationships with Lilly and Leonard are
two of the truest that James has ever known. James's parents arrive at the clinic for the Family Program, despite
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) objections. Though seeing them is upsetting, James decides to
participate. During a critical session, James finds out that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
had an ear infection throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) early childhood that made him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
scream and cry, which his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) parents left untreated. Also, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) finds out
that his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) grandfather had a drinking problem. James's parents feel
that maybe his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) grandfather's addiction and the untreated ear infection
had something to do with James's addictions, but he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) refuses to accept
this theory. As is his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) way in most areas of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) life, James wants
to go it alone and do things deeply and completely--this includes
taking all responsibility for his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) condition. His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) addiction, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) believes,
is no illness. It is a weakness. It can only be overcome by taking
full ownership. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) comes to this conclusion, things begin to
change for James. James's parents have to leave unexpectedly because James's father
has a pressing business engagement. Although their early departure
upsets James, their good-byes are on good terms. Soon after, James
finds out from a distraught Lilly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lilly</b></font>) grandmother is gravely
ill and only has a short time to live. Lilly runs away from the clinic,
and James literally runs off after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lilly</b></font>). Two clinic staff members,
Hank and Lincoln, follow him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) in a van and offer assistance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lilly</b></font>)
is eventually found in an abandoned building in the middle of a sexual
act, and it is clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lilly</b></font>) has been smoking crack. Though James
sees crack and has a chance to use it, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) chooses Lilly over the drugs.
He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Lilly</b></font>) safely back to the clinic and is permitted to stay. Lilly
is forced to start over again with detoxification and will have
to pay for another term, something she (<font color='blue'><b>Lilly</b></font>) cannot afford. Continuing his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) quest to accept responsibility for his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
own life, James faces the criminal charges against him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) in Ohio.
At first, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'ll have to be in jail for three years,
but the sentence is mysteriously reduced to three months. James
believes that his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) friend Leonard and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) roommate Miles Davis helped
reduce his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sentence, but this fact is never confirmed. Leonard completes
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) program and prepares to leave the clinic. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) does, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
arranges for Lilly's program to be paid for and asks James to be
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) son. The day before James leaves to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) jail sentence,
he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) confesses that a priest in Paris made unwanted sexual advances
toward him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) beat the man seriously, possibly even killing
him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). This admission triggers a release in James, and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
is ready to leave. James's brother and a friend pick him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) up at the
clinic, and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) immediately asks them to go to a bar. His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) brother
and friend are stunned but give in to James's request. At the bar
James has Bob give him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) forty dollars and orders an entire pint glass
full of whiskey. After looking at the glass and smelling the whiskey,
James asks the bartender to pour it down the drain.
