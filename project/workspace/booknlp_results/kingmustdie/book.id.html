The tale begins in Troizen, the land of Theseus' grandfather, King Pittheus. Theseus believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) is the son of the sea-god Poseidon. At an early age he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) discovers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) can sense earthquakes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) interprets this skill as proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) heritage. Small for his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) age, Theseus learns to outwrestle larger youths by using his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) agility. At seventeen he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) finds out that his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) father is Aigeus, King of Athens, although Pittheus tells him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) that Poseidon may have had something to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) birth. Theseus decides to go to Athens, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) does not take a Cretan ship there after the Cretans in the harbor insult some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) people. Instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) goes through the dangerous Isthmus Road with Dexios, his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) friend, as charioteer. Dexios is murdered on the journey, but Theseus avenges him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) and arrives unharmed. Theseus comes to Eleusis on the day when the king must die, and the queen tells Theseus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) must wrestle with the current king. In Eleusis, as in some other kingdoms of the Minyans, Mother Dia is the supreme deity, and the queen reigns supreme. The king, named Kerkyon in Eleusis, is killed each year. After Theseus kills the king, he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) sleeps with the queen and becomes Kerkyon himself. But Theseus does not come from the same background as the other people from Eleusis, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) does not act the same as other Kerkyons before him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) trains his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) personal guard, the Companions, and makes them warriors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) proves to the queen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) is in charge. Theseus befriends Pylas, the heir to the neighboring Megarian throne, and together the two kingdoms wipe out all of the thieves in the Isthmus Road. Xanthos, the Queen's brother, tries to have Theseus killed in the battle, but Theseus kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) in armed combat. Then Theseus goes on to Athens to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) arrives in Athens, and greets the king. Just before Theseus tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) father who he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) really is, his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) father realizes that Theseus is his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) son and knocks away a cup of poisoned wine that the Lady Medea wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) to give to Theseus. Theseus learns that Aigeus intended to poison the King of Eleusis in order to lift a curse from Mother Dia, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) is supposed to kill his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) own son, he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) refuses. Medea curses Theseus and then flees, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) is never found. Aigeus needs to fight a war to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) kingdom, but Theseus tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) father he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) must first return to Eleusis, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) does so against his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) father's wishes. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) gets to Eleusis he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) meets the Companions, who have heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) traded Eleusis to Athens in return for being pronounced heir to the Athenian throne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) reveals his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) heritage, makes a rousing speech to the army, and returns home triumphant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) learns that the Queen is dying, having poisoned herself with the House Snake. Theseus changes some of the customs in Eleusis, and helps his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) father win a war in Athens. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) father tries to protect him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from the Cretan lottery, Theseus volunteers to become a bull-dancer. Along with seven girls and six boys, all from Athens or Eleusis, Theseus heads to Crete as a slave. In Crete he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) meets Asterion. Minos' heir is evil and hungry for power. Although his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) attempt to embarrass Theseus fails, he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) still treats the King of Eleusis as an inferior. They go to Knossos Palace, known as the House of the Ax, a place whose immensity shocks Theseus. There, the group of slaves, bound together by an oath and calling themselves the Cranes, begins training to be bull-dancers. Theseus watches the Corinthian, who is the best of the bull-leapers, the most prized position for a bull-dancer. Over time, the Cranes become the best group and Theseus becomes the best bull-leaper. Ariadne, Minos' daughter and the Goddess-on-Earth, falls in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) begins plans to escape from Crete. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) meets King Minos, who has leprosy, and learns that the King wants him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to marry Ariadne and become the next Minos. But Asterion is very powerful and it will be tough to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). Minos has Theseus sacrifice him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) with the sacred ax Labrys. The next day, Asterion tries to fix the bull-dance and have Theseus killed. Although Theseus survives, everyone expects Poseidon to be angered, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) sacred rite has been tampered with. The following morning there are two small earthquakes, and Theseus realizes there is going to be a great earthquake. The bull-dancers break out of the Bull Court, and get outside of the Palace, and Theseus goes back for Ariadne just as the quake hits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) saves her (<font color='blue'><b>Poseidon</b></font>), and then Theseus leads a charge into the remnants of the Palace to kill Asterion, with the native Cretans supporting them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) finds Asterion in the midst of being anointed the next Minos and kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>). They leave the island to return to their homes, bringing Ariadne with them. They stop on the island of Naxos, where Ariadne is highly respected and the Queen there invites them to stay for the feast of Dionysos the next day. At the feast, Ariadne takes part in the sacrifice of the King, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) role is so horrifying to Theseus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) leaves the island without her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) returns to Athens, and learns that his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) father has committed suicide. Years later, after many other adventures and hardship, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) old age, when Poseidon no longer speaks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>), Theseus knows only that the fate of man is beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) ability to understand.
