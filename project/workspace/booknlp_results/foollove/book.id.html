In a low-budget motel room on the outskirts of the Mojave Desert where May has been living, Eddie and May sit without speaking to each other--she (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) head between her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) knees over the side of the bed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) in a chair. The only sound is that of Eddie fidgeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) glove and bucking strap. The Old Man sits in rocking chair next to a bottle of whiskey. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) talks to the actors, the Old Man only exists in May and Eddie's minds. Eddie tries to get May to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) reassures May that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) is staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) and will not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) again. May hold on to Eddie's legs desperately but will not speak. May is torn between wanting Eddie to leave and to stay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) accuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) of having an affair with a rich woman. Eddie denies it and asks for sympathy from May by telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) drove to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) desperately. May is slightly moved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) feelings but then remembers his (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) affair with the woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) calls <div class="bookquote">``the Countess.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>May accuses Eddie of sleeping with the Countess regularly. Eddie presents to May a dream that they will move back into the trailer together to Wyoming. Just as they are about to kiss, May knees Eddie in the groin. May exits triumphantly to the bathroom as Eddie suffers and talks to the Old Man who has watched the play until this point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) asks Eddie if he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) is basically a <div class="bookquote">``fantasist''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or someone who makes things up. May returns with a change of clothing. Eddie offers to leave again and this time May who has transformed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) dowdy clothes into a sexy red dress and black heels tells Eddie that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) better leave because she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) has a date. Eddie gets angry at May and goes outside. While Eddie is gone, May runs and grabs her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) suitcase from under the bed. Eddie reenters with a bottle of tequila and a shotgun in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) offers May some tequila but she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) declines saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)'s <div class="bookquote">``on the wagon.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Eddie and May discuss May's upcoming date. The Old Man speaks to May and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) a story about a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>), May's mother, and baby May were driving in southern Utah and May would not stop crying. May hears Eddie coming back, leaps up, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grief and takes a drink. Eddie returns and proposes that May introduce Eddie to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) date as her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cousin. May reports that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sees a Mercedes with a woman in it, and they hear the Mercedes drive away. Eddie sees that the Countess has blown out the windshield of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) truck. As May and Eddie face off with one another, the Old Man talks to the audience about how neither May nor Eddie resembles him (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>). Another car arrives, this time with May's date, Martin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) thinks May is being attacked by Eddie and after a short scuffle, throws Eddie to the ground. May breaks up the fight and introduces Eddie as her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) cousin. Eddie and Martin talk, and Eddie reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) is May's half-sister and that they <div class="bookquote">``fooled around''  (<font color='red'><b>May half-sister</b></font>)</div>in high school before they knew of their blood relationship. Eddie tells Martin about the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) found about his (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) father's secret life with May's mother. The Old Man occasionally contributes his (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) point of view. May is angry because Eddie told his (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) side of the story to Martin. May tells the story from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) point of view and the way it affected her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) youth with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother who was always desperately waiting for the Old Man to come back. May ends her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) story by saying that when her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother tried to stop Eddie and May from having a sexual relationship, Eddie's mother shot herself in the head. The Old Man is surprised and disturbed by this revelation, claiming no one ever told him (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) that part of the story. Eddie adds that his (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) mother killed herself with the Old Man's shotgun. There is an explosion and Martin looks out the window and tells them that Eddie's horse trailer is ablaze and the horses have been let loose. Eddie says he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) is going out to see the damage that the Countess has done and promises to be right back. May packs her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) suitcase and tells Martin that Eddie is gone. May leaves with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) packed suitcase and Martin stares out the window as the fire continues to blaze outside.
