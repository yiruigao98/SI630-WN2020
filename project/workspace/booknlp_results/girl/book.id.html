<html><head><style> .bookquote {background-color:#FFDDFF; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px; overflow:auto; display:inline; border-bottom: dotted; border-width: thin; }</style></head><body><h1>Characters</h1><h1>Text</h1><p/><div class="bookquote">``Girl''  (<font color='red'><b>a mother</b></font>)</div>consists of a single sentence of advice a mother imparts to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter, only twice interrupted by the girl to ask a question or defend herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) intends the advice to both help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter and scold her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at the same time. Kincaid uses semicolons to separate the admonishments and words of wisdom but often repeats herself, especially to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter against becoming a <div class="bookquote">``slut.''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>Besides these repetitions, <div class="bookquote">``Girl''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>doesn't move forward chronologically: there is no beginning, middle, or end to the stream. The mother dispenses much practical and helpful advice that will help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter keep a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own some day. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter how to do such household chores as laundry, sewing, ironing, cooking, setting the table, sweeping, and washing. The mother also tells the girl how to do other things she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll need to know about, including how to make herbal medicines and catch a fish. These words of wisdom suggest that the women live in a poor, rural setting, where passing on such advice is essential for daily living. Alongside practical advice, the mother also instructs her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter on how to live a fulfilling life. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) offers sympathy, such as when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) talks about the relationships her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter will one day have with men, warning that men and women sometimes <div class="bookquote">``bully''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>each other. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) also says that there are many kinds of relationships and some never work out. The mother also tells the girl how to behave in different situations, including how to talk with people she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't like. Often, however, the mother's advice seems caustic and castigating, out of fear that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter is already well on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) way to becoming a <div class="bookquote">``slut.''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tells the girl, for example, not to squat while playing marbles, not to sing any Antiguan folk songs in Sunday school, and to always walk like a lady. The girl periodically interjects to protest her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) innocence.
