Magically, the pants fit Carmen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) three best friends, Lena,
Tibby, and Bridget, equally, even though the girls have very different
bodies. The girls, who <div class="bookquote">``met''  (<font color='red'><b>The girls</b></font>)</div>before birth when their mothers were
in a prenatal aerobics class together, are spending this summer
apart--their first significant separation. Carmen will go to South
Carolina to spend the summer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) father. Lena will go to Greece
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) sister, Effie, to spend the summer with their grandparents.
Bridget will spend the summer at soccer camp in Baja California,
Mexico. Only Tibby will stay home in Bethesda, Maryland, to work
at Wallman's, a superstore. Before each girl sets off to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) summer
destination, they have a friendship ceremony at Gilda's gym, where
their mothers met so many years ago. To stay close while they're
apart, they vow to send the pants--which they call the Traveling
Pants--to one another throughout the summer. Tibby immediately hates Wallman's and decides to make
a <div class="bookquote">``suckumentary''  (<font color='red'><b>Wallman</b></font>)</div>about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gilda</b></font>) summer, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Gilda</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Gilda</b></font>)'ll continue
to hate everything and everyone. Meanwhile, Carmen is devastated
in South Carolina when her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) father surprises her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) with big news: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s engaged,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fianc√©e, Lydia, has two teenage stepchildren, Paul and Krista.
Carmen, who is half Puerto Rican, feels out of place in this new
family. In Greece, Lena's grandmother tries to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) up with a
Greek boy named Kostos, but Lena wants nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>)
doesn't trust any boys and assumes that if Kostos likes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>), it'll
be only because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>)'s beautiful. Bridget develops a crush on Eric, a
coach at soccer camp. One day at work, Tibby sees a young girl collapses in
the store and rides with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the ambulance. In the days that
follow, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) meets the girl, whose name is Bailey, a few more times.
Bailey is twelve and has leukemia. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s fascinated with Tibby's
film, and Tibby reluctantly lets her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) start helping. In South Carolina,
Carmen does not settle in well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) hates the new family, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>)'s
rude to everyone, even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) finds out that Lydia's ex-husband
was an alcoholic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>)'s sick of hearing everyone talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>)
father's upcoming wedding. Meanwhile, Bridget starts flirting relentlessly with
Eric, trying to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>)'s older than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>)
is and a coach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) convinces a few of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) new friends to sneak to
a nearby bar with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) one night, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) dances with Eric. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) plays soccer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) plays too aggressively, angering her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) coach. In Greece, Lena spends her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) days painting, walking, and
trying to get closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) grandparents. One day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) goes skinny-dipping
in a beautiful, isolated pond--and Kostos sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) assumes he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
was spying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) and storms home angrily, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) clothes askew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) doesn't
correct her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) grandparents when they assume that Kostos attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>),
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) grandfather punches Kostos's grandfather. Still, Lena can't
bring herself to tell the truth about what happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>)'s surprised
to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>)'s upset when Kostos starts ignoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>). Tibby and Bailey interview a video game player named Brian McBrian,
and Tibby finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) more interesting than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) expected to. Next,
they interview Margaret, a woman who has worked for years at the
movie theater. Expecting to mock her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), Tibby instead feels bad for
Margaret, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)'s obviously very lonely. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) documentary is
turning out to be different than she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) expected. Carmen goes with Lydia and Krista to try on a bridesmaid's dress,
which doesn't fit her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) storms out of the shop, insulting
Lydia on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) way out. Later, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) father and everyone else act like nothing
happened, and Carmen runs out of the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) expects her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) father
to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) or come out looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't. Eventually,
Carmen goes home and sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) new family calmly eating
dinner around the table. Enraged and jealous, Carmen throws a rock
through the window, breaking it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) then flees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) takes a
bus back to Bethesda. Bridget sneaks to Eric's cabin and wakes him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) doesn't immediately
pull away from Bridget when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) touches his (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) head and chest, but
eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) to leave. Bridget takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) words as encouragement.
Bridget is determined to make something happen, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) visits him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>)
again at his (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) cabin a few nights later. This time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) gives in to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>), and they have an intimate encounter. Later, Bridget is very
upset, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) can't get out of bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>)'s listless for many days. On
the day of the big soccer match, Bridget explodes at the coach and
leaves in the middle of the game. Eric tries to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridget</b></font>) about what
happened between them, but Bridget is too upset. Carmen feels immensely guilty about what she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) did, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) doesn't know how to make it right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) father an envelope full
of money to help fix the broken window. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) finally gathers
the courage to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) lets her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) anger come through. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>)
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) how hurt she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) is that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) mother and has a
new family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) decides to surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) father, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) flies to
South Carolina and goes to the church on the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wedding.
They promise to be more honest with each other from now on. Lena is distracted and unable to paint, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>)'s upset
because Kostos has been ignoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) walks back to the pond,
and this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) sees Kostos swimming naked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hadn't
been spying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) that day, and that this is his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) secret place to
swim. At home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) paints a picture of Kostos. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) grandmother tells
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) that, years ago, Kostos's parents and brother were killed in
a car accident. One day, Bailey doesn't show up at Wallman's to meet Tibby after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) shift, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>)'s done reliably all summer. Tibby is alarmed
and finds out Bailey is in the hospital. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) gets there, Bailey's
mother tells Tibby that Bailey has gotten an infection and may not
recover. Mimi, Tibby's guinea pig, dies. Tibby can't face the truth
and puts Mimi's dead body in the freezer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mimi</b></font>) begins ignoring phone
calls from Bailey and Bailey's mother. Carmen hears one of these
calls and convinces Tibby to visit the hospital. Tibby finally does
and sees that Bailey is not doing well. A few days later, Bailey dies.
The night after the funeral, Tibby buries Mimi near Bailey's grave. Effie sees Lena's picture of Kostos and realizes that
Lena is in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) convinces Lena to tell Kostos how
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) feels, since their time in Greece is almost over. When Lena
finds Kostos, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) a painting she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) did of the olive grove
near the pond, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) feels. They kiss. The next
day, on the plane home from Greece, Lena decides to go to Mexico
and help Bridget, who she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) knows can have a hard time recovering
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) sadness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) gets to Mexico in time to help Bridget get
home. When all the girls are back in Bethesda, they gather for
a birthday celebration at Gilda's. They write down their experiences
on the Pants and begin reacquainting themselves with one another.
