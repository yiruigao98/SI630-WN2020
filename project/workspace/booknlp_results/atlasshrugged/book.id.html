conditions, Dagny Taggart, vice president in charge of operations,
works to repair Taggart Transcontinental's crumbling Rio Norte Line
to service Colorado, the last booming industrial area in the country.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Taggart</b></font>) efforts are hampered by the fact that many of the country's
most talented entrepreneurs are retiring and disappearing. The railroad's
crisis worsens when the Mexican government nationalizes Taggart's
San Sebastian Line. The line had been built to service Francisco
d'Anconia's copper mills, but the mills turn out to be worthless.
Francisco had been a successful industrialist, and Dagny's lover,
but has become a worthless playboy. To solve the railroad's financial
problems, Dagny's brother Jim uses political influence to pass legislation
that destroys Taggart's only competition in Colorado. Dagny must
fix the Rio Norte Line immediately and plans to use Rearden Metal,
a new alloy created by Hank Rearden. When confronted about the San
Sebastian mines, Francisco tells Dagny he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) is deliberately destroying
d'Anconia Copper. Later he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) appears at Rearden's anniversary party
and, meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) for the first time, urges Rearden to reject the
freeloaders who live off of him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>). The State Science Institute issues a denunciation of Rearden metal,
and Taggart's stock crashes. Dagny decides to start her (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) own company
to rebuild the line, and it is a huge success. Dagny and Rearden
become lovers. Together they discover a motor in an abandoned factory
that runs on static electricity, and they seek the inventor. The
government passes new legislation that cripples industry in Colorado.
Ellis Wyatt, an oil industrialist, suddenly disappears after setting
fire to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wyatt</b></font>) wells. Dagny is forced to cut trains, and the situation
worsens. Soon, more industrialists disappear. Dagny believes there
is a destroyer at work, taking men away when they are most needed.
Francisco visits Rearden and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) remains in business
under such repressive conditions. When a fire breaks out and they
work together to put it out, Francisco understands Rearden's love
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) mills. Rearden goes on trial for breaking one of the new laws,
but refuses to participate in the proceedings, telling the judges
they can coerce him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) by force but he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) won't help them to convict him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>).
Unwilling to be seen as thugs, they let him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) go. Economic dictator
Wesley Mouch needs Rearden's cooperation for a new set of socialist
laws, and Jim needs economic favors that will keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ailing railroad
running after the collapse of Colorado. Jim appeals to Rearden's
wife Lillian, who wants to destroy her (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) Rearden and
Dagny are having an affair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) uses this information in a trade.
The new set of laws, Directive 10-289,
is irrational and repressive. It includes a ruling that requires
all patents to be signed over to the government. Rearden is blackmailed
into signing over his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) metal to protect Dagny's reputation. Dagny quits over the new directive and retreats to a mountain lodge.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) learns of a massive accident at the Taggart Tunnel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>)
returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) job. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) receives a letter from the scientist she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>)
had hired to help rebuild the motor, and fears he (<font color='blue'><b>scientist</b></font>) will be the next
target of the destroyer. In an attempt to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>scientist</b></font>) from disappearing,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) follows him (<font color='blue'><b>scientist</b></font>) in an airplane and crashes in the mountains. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) wakes up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) finds herself in a remote valley where all the
retired industrialists are living. They are on strike, calling it
a strike of the mind. There, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) meets John Galt, who turns out
to be both the destroyer and the man who built the motor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) falls
in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) cannot give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) railroad, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) leaves
the valley. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) returns to work, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) finds that the government
has nationalized the railroad industry. Government leaders want
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) to make a speech reassuring the public about the new laws. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>)
refuses until Lillian comes to blackmail her (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>). On the air, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) proudly
announces her (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>) affair with Rearden and reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been blackmailed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lillian</b></font>)
warns the country about its repressive government. With the economy on the verge of collapse, Francisco destroys the
rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) holdings and disappears. The politicians no longer even
pretend to work for the public good. Their vast network of influence
peddling creates worse chaos, as crops rot waiting for freight trains
that are diverted for personal favors. In an attempt to gain control
of Francisco's mills, the government stages a riot at Rearden Steel.
But the steelworkers organize and fight back, led by Francisco,
who has been working undercover at the mills. Francisco saves Rearden's
life, then convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) to join the strike. Just as the head of state prepares to give a speech on
the economic situation, John Galt takes over the airwaves and delivers
a lengthy address to the country, laying out the terms of the strike
he (<font color='blue'><b>Galt</b></font>) has organized. In desperation, the government seeks Galt to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Galt</b></font>) their economic dictator. Dagny inadvertently leads them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Galt</b></font>),
and they take him (<font color='blue'><b>Galt</b></font>) prisoner. But Galt refuses to help them, even
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Galt</b></font>) is tortured. Finally, Dagny and the strikers rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>Galt</b></font>)
in an armed confrontation with guards. They return to the valley,
where Dagny finally joins the strike. Soon, the country's collapse
is complete and the strikers prepare to return.
