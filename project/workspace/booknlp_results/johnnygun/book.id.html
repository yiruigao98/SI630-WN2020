While conscious, Joe thinks back over scenes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) past: the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) father's death and the night before he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) girlfriend Kareen to go to World War I. Before his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) family moved to Los Angeles, Joe grew up in Shale City, a small town in Colorado. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) remembers small-town memories and images, such as the food his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mother would prepare, the first time an airplane came to Shale City, and the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) girlfriend, Diane, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) best friend, Bill Harper. The narrative shifts from the past to the present as Joe thinks regretfully about his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) decision to join a war that was not any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) business. Slowly, Joe begins to realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) has been severely injured and treated in a hospital, which is where he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) currently lies. Joe gradually feels that his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) arms and legs have been amputated. Furthermore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) cannot speak, see, hear, or smell because he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) no longer has a face--only a mask covering where his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) face used to be. Joe wonders bitterly abut the doctors' motivation for saving him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) at all. Joe continues to live inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head, reliving memories and terrorized by nightmares. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wonders how he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) can even tell whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is awake or asleep. Joe thinks about his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) father kept beautiful gardens in a vacant city lot and fed his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) children well, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was never officially a success because he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) never made any money. Joe continues to think bitterly about the foolishness of fighting and dying in a war that had nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), and about the deceitfulness of abstract words like <div class="bookquote">``liberty,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``democracy,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``freedom,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``decency.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Time passes, and Joe tries to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mind with stories, facts, and figures. One day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) should use the skin he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) has left--the skin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) neck that is not covered by blankets--to try to sense the outside world. Joe develops a plan to wait for the feeling of sunrise so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) can tally the nurses' visits and count the passing of the days. A year later, Joe has accomplished his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) goal and counted up 365 days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) celebrates the New Year in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mind, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) has celebrated each Sunday of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) year with an imagined walk in the woods. In Joe's fourth year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is amazed to feel that the hospital staff is prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to be shown to visitors. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) feels the visitors lay something on his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) chest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is being given a medal. Joe becomes angry and shudders in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) bed, trying to remove his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mask to show the visitors how much damage men like him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) sustained in the war while generals emerged unscathed. Joe feels the vibrations of the men leaving the room. An idea comes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) can sense the outside world through vibrations, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) might also communicate to the outside world with vibrations. Joe begins tapping SOS in Morse code with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) regular nurse assumes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is having seizures and sedates him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>). Joe awakens from his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) sedation to realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) has a new day nurse. The new day nurse tries to communicate with Joe by spelling out <div class="bookquote">``MERRY CHRISTMAS''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe</b></font>)</div>on his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) chest. Joe signals with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) understands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) begins trying to tap Morse code to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>). After trying to appease his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) tapping by making him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) more comfortable in various ways, the nurse eventually realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is trying to communicate in words. The nurse goes to get a man who understands Morse code. This man taps onto Joe's forehead the words <div class="bookquote">``WHAT DO YOU WANT?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe</b></font>)</div>Joe spends some time thinking about the inappropriateness of the question and then tries to think about what in fact it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wants. Joe asks in Morse code to be taken around the outside world as an educational exhibit on the realities of war. The man listens to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) response and returns a while later to tap into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``WHAT YOU ASK IS AGAINST REGULATIONS.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man continues tapping other messages, but Joe is no longer paying attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is still trying to process this betrayal on the part of the people for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) fought a war when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) feels the hospital staff sedating him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) again. Joe taps the question <div class="bookquote">``why? why? why?'' (<font color='red'><b>Joe</b></font>)</div>--wondering why they will not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) talk or acknowledge that there is still a person inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mangled body. Joe suddenly realizes that they are afraid to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) out, to let other men see him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) as the <div class="bookquote">``new messiah of the battlefields.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>If other men see Joe, they would no longer agree to fight in wars--especially wars ordered by the upper classes, but fought only by the lower classes of peaceful, working men.
