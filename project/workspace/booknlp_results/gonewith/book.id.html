Scarlett
O'Hara, a pretty Southern belle, lives on Tara, a large plantation
in Georgia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) concerns herself only with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) numerous suitors
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) desire to marry Ashley Wilkes. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) hears that Ashley
is engaged to Melanie Hamilton, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) frail, plain cousin from Atlanta.
At a barbecue at the Wilkes plantation the next day, Scarlett confesses her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>)
feelings to Ashley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) does love her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) but that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) is marrying Melanie because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) is similar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>), whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>)
and Scarlett are very different. Scarlett slaps Ashley and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) leaves
the room. Suddenly Scarlett realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) is not alone. Rhett
Butler, a scandalous but dashing adventurer, has been watching the
whole scene, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) compliments Scarlett on being unladylike. The Civil War begins. Charles Hamilton, Melanie's timid,
dull brother, proposes to Scarlett. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>) spitefully agrees to marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>), hoping to hurt Ashley. Over the course of two months, Scarlett
and Charles marry, Charles joins the army and dies of the measles,
and Scarlett learns that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) is pregnant. After Scarlett gives birth
to a son, Wade, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) becomes bored and unhappy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) makes a long
trip to Atlanta to stay with Melanie and Melanie's aunt, Pittypat.
The busy city agrees with Scarlett's temperament, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>) begins
to see a great deal of Rhett. Rhett infuriates Scarlett with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rhett</b></font>)
bluntness and mockery, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) also encourages her (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>) to flout the severely
restrictive social requirements for mourning Southern widows. As
the war progresses, food and clothing run scarce in Atlanta. Scarlett
and Melanie fear for Ashley's safety. After the bloody battle of
Gettysburg, Ashley is captured and sent to prison, and the Yankee
army begins bearing down on Atlanta. Scarlett desperately wants
to return home to Tara, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) has promised Ashley she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) will stay
with the pregnant Melanie, who could give birth at any time. On the night the Yankees capture Atlanta and set it afire,
Melanie gives birth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>) son, Beau. Rhett helps Scarlett and Melanie
escape the Yankees, escorting them through the burning streets of
the city, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) abandons them outside Atlanta so he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) can join the
Confederate Army. Scarlett drives the cart all night and day through
a dangerous forest full of deserters and soldiers, at last reaching
Tara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) arrives to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) mother, Ellen, is dead; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) father,
Gerald, has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) mind; and the Yankee army has looted the plantation,
leaving no food or cotton. Scavenging for subsistence, a furious
Scarlett vows never to go hungry again. Scarlett takes charge of rebuilding Tara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) murders
a Yankee thief and puts out a fire set by a spiteful Yankee soldier.
At last the war ends, word comes that Ashley is free and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>)
way home, and a stream of returning soldiers begins pouring through
Tara. One such soldier, a one-legged homeless Confederate named
Will Benteen, stays on and helps Scarlett with the plantation. One
day, Will brings terrible news: Jonas Wilkerson, a former employee
at Tara and current government official, has raised the taxes on
Tara, hoping to drive the O'Haras out so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) might buy the plantation. Distraught,
Scarlett hurries to Atlanta to seduce Rhett Butler so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) will
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) the three hundred dollars she (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) needs for taxes. Rhett has
emerged from the war a fabulously wealthy man, dripping with earnings
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rhett</b></font>) blockade-running operation and from food speculation. However,
Rhett is in a Yankee jail and cannot help Scarlett. Scarlett sees
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) sister's beau, Frank Kennedy, who now owns a general store,
and forges a plan. Determined to save Tara, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) betrays her (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) sister
and marries Frank, pays the taxes on Tara, and devotes herself to
making Frank's business more profitable. After Rhett blackmails his (<font color='blue'><b>Rhett</b></font>) way out of prison, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rhett</b></font>) lends
Scarlett enough money to buy a sawmill. To the displeasure of Atlanta
society, Scarlett becomes a shrewd businesswoman. Gerald dies, and Scarlett
returns to Tara for the funeral. There, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) persuades Ashley and
Melanie to move to Atlanta and accept a share in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) lumber business.
Shortly thereafter, Scarlett gives birth to Frank's child, Ella Lorena. A free black man and his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) white male companion attack
Scarlett on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorena</b></font>) way home from the sawmill one day. That night, the
Ku Klux Klan avenges the attack on Scarlett, and Frank ends up dead.
Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorena</b></font>) quickly accepts. After a long,
luxurious honeymoon in New Orleans, Scarlett and Rhett return to
Atlanta, where Scarlett builds a garish mansion and socializes with
wealthy Yankees. Scarlett becomes pregnant again and has another
child, Bonnie Blue Butler. Rhett dotes on the girl and begins a
successful campaign to win back the good graces of the prominent
Atlanta citizens in order to keep Bonnie from being an outcast like
Scarlett. Scarlett and Rhett's marriage begins happily, but Rhett
becomes increasingly bitter and indifferent toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Bonnie</b></font>). Scarlett's
feelings for Ashley have diminished into a warm, sympathetic friendship,
but Ashley's jealous sister, India, finds them in a friendly embrace
and spreads the rumor that they are having an affair. To Scarlett's
surprise, Melanie takes Scarlett's side and refuses to believe the
rumors. After Bonnie is killed in a horse-riding accident, Rhett
nearly loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Rhett</b></font>) mind, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rhett</b></font>) marriage with Scarlett worsens. Not
long after the funeral, Melanie has a miscarriage and falls very
ill. Distraught, Scarlett hurries to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>). Melanie makes Scarlett
promise to look after Ashley and Beau. Scarlett realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>)
loves and depends on Melanie and that Ashley has been only a fantasy
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) concludes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashley</b></font>) truly loves Rhett. After Melanie
dies, Scarlett hurries to tell Rhett of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>) revelation. Rhett, however,
says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) love for Scarlett, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarlett</b></font>) leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>).
Grief-stricken and alone, Scarlett makes up her (<font color='blue'><b>Melanie</b></font>) mind to go back
to Tara to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) strength in the comforting arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tara</b></font>) childhood
nurse and slave, Mammy, and to think of a way to win Rhett back.
