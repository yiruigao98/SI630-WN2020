One day, Aylmer asks his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) wife whether she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has ever thought about removing the birthmark on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cheerfully says no but grows serious when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) asked the question seriously. Many people, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says, have told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the mark is a charm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has always thought maybe they were right. Aylmer says that because her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face is almost perfect, any mark is shocking. Georgiana is angry at first, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) weeps, asking how he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) can love her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) is shocking to him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>). The narrator explains that the birthmark in question is a red mark in the shape of a tiny hand on Georgiana's left cheek. The mark disappears when she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) blushes. Georgiana's male admirers love the birthmark, and many would risk their lives just to kiss it. Some women think the mark ruins her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) beauty, but the narrator says this is nonsense. Aylmer obsesses about the birthmark. For him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>), it symbolizes mortality and sin and comes to tower over Georgiana's beauty in his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) can think of nothing else. One night she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) of a dream he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) had. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) spoke in his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) sleep, saying they must take out her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) heart. Aylmer remembers dreaming that he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) had removed the birthmark with a knife, plunging down until he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife's heart, which he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) decided to cut out. Georgiana says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) will risk her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) life to have the birthmark erased. Thrilled, Aylmer agrees to try. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) professes complete confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) own abilities, likening himself to Pygmalion. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) kisses his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife's unmarked cheek. They decide to move to the apartments where Aylmer has his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) laboratory. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) has already made stunning discoveries about volcanoes, fountains, mines, and other natural wonders. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) will resume his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) studies of the creation of life. As the couple enters the laboratory, Aylmer shudders at the sight of Georgiana, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) faints. Aminadab, Aylmer's grotesque assistant, comes out to help. He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) would not remove the birthmark if Georgiana were his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) wife. Georgiana wakes up in sweet-smelling rooms that have been made beautiful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>). Aylmer comforts her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) with some of his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) more magical creations: <div class="bookquote">``airy figures, absolute bodiless ideas, and forms of unsubstantial beauty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Aylmer</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) moving scenes that mimic real life. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) a fast-growing flower that dies as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) touches it. Next he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) tries to create a portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) with a metal plate, but when the plate shows a hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) throws it into acid. Between experiments, Aylmer tells Georgiana about alchemy. He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) could turn base metal into gold and create a potion that would grant eternal life if he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) wanted to, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) knows that doing so would be wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) disappears for hours and then shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) cabinet of wonders. One such wonder is a vial that holds a powerful perfume. Another is a poison that, depending on the dose, would allow Aylmer to kill someone instantly or after a long period of time. Georgiana is appalled, but Aylmer says the poison is more good than bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) another potion that can wipe away freckles, but he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) says her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) birthmark needs a much deeper cure. Georgiana realizes that Aylmer has been doctoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) food or making her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) inhale something in the air. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) body feels strange. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) reads the books in his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) scientific library, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) own experiments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) realizes that his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) achievements always fall short of the goals he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) originally sets. Still, the accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) studies make her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) worship him (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>). Aylmer catches her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) crying over his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) journals, and although his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) words are kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) is angry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sings to him (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>), restoring his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) spirits. A few hours later, Georgiana goes to the laboratory to find Aylmer. When he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) grows angry, accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) of prying, and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) to go away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) stands her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) ground and refuses, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) should trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) and not try to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) fears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) promises to drink whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) to drink. Moved, Aylmer says the mark goes deep into her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) body, and its removal will be dangerous. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) room, Georgiana thinks about how noble it is that Aylmer refuses to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) is, insisting instead to create his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) ideal version of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) a potion that he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) says cannot fail. He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) how it cures a geranium of blots. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) drinks the liquid and sleeps. Aylmer watches her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) with tenderness but also as if he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) is watching a scientific experiment unfold. Gradually the birthmark fades. Aminadab laughs. Georgiana wakes, sees herself in the mirror, and tells Aylmer not to feel bad about rejecting <div class="bookquote">``the best the earth could offer.''  (<font color='red'><b>Aylmer</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) dies.
