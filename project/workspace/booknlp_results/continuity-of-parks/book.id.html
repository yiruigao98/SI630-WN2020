He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sits in a green armchair with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back to the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes the feeling of giving himself over to the story while simultaneously enjoying the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cigarettes, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) armchair, and the view of the park from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) window. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sinks into the novel, in which a man and woman meet in a cabin. The woman kisses the man's face where a tree branch has scratched it, making it bleed. The man and woman are lovers, but their attention is now focused on murder: the man is going to kill the woman's husband. They leave the cabin and split up. The woman goes north, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house. Following her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) instructions, knife in hand, the man goes inside and sees his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) victim: a man who's sitting in an armchair reading a book.
