George F. Babbitt, a 46- year-old real estate broker, enjoys all the modern conveniences available to a prosperous middle-class businessman, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>) is dissatisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>) life. When the novel opens, Babbitt has begun to regularly indulge in fantasies about a fairy girl who makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) feel like a gallant youth. Babbitt's family consists of his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) three children, Verona, Ted, and Tinka, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) dowdy, devoted wife, Myra. Babbitt's closest friend Paul Riesling is even more dissatisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) is also more vocal about it. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) dreamed of becoming a professional violinist in his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) youth, Riesling became mired in the life of the average middle-class businessman of his (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>) generation. His (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>) wife, Zilla, is equally unsatisfied with the monotonous, conventional routine of Zenith, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) vents her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) frustrations by constantly nagging Paul. Riesling has often spoken of divorcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wife, but, like Babbitt's frequent declarations that he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) is going to quit smoking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) never follows through. Riesling and Babbitt try to ameliorate their dissatisfaction by taking a vacation in Maine together, but their enjoyment at their newfound freedom is short-lived. They eventually have to return to their lives as middle-aged married men. Both men experience a growing impulse to rebel against social conventions. When Babbitt discovers that Riesling is having an affair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) preaches the value of maintaining one's good social standing in the community. Riesling retorts that his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) life is miserable, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) doesn't feel guilty for seeking a little comfort in the arms of another woman. Soon thereafter, Riesling and Zilla have another argument; Riesling snaps, shoots his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) wife, and subsequently receives a sentence of three years in the state penitentiary. Babbitt is devastated by the loss of Riesling's steadying presence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) own desire for rebellion comes to the surface when he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) wants his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) fairy girl in the flesh. When the attractive widow, Tanis Judique, enters his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) life, Babbitt thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) has found his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) fairy girl and begins an affair. At the same time, Babbitt becomes more critical of the conservative opinions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) friends. When the threat of a general strike hangs over Zenith, Babbitt ventures to support some of the claims of the strikers, shocking and alienating his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) social set. While Myra is away nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Myra</b></font>) sick sister, Babbitt stays out late, drinking and partying with Tanis' bohemian friends. Babbitt's friends do not fail to take notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) rebellion. They attempt to coax him (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) back into their inner circle, but Babbitt remains defiant. Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Myra</b></font>) return to Zenith, Myra becomes suspicious of Babbitt's activities. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) finally admits to her (<font color='blue'><b>Myra</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) is having an affair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Myra</b></font>) that it is her (<font color='blue'><b>Myra</b></font>) fault. However, Babbitt becomes disillusioned with Tanis when he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) realizes that in many ways, her (<font color='blue'><b>Myra</b></font>) life is just as conventional as his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>). Meanwhile, Babbitt's friends try to bully him (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) into returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) old ways. When Babbitt refuses to conform, they shun him (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) business begins to suffer. When Myra falls seriously ill with appendicitis, Babbitt realizes that it is too late to become a rebel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) once again becomes a devoted husband and deeply regrets the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) has caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) wife. Babbitt's friends offer their support during the crisis. Babbitt gratefully accepts the chance to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) old life and quickly regains his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) respectable social status. Meanwhile, when Ted shocks everyone by eloping with Eunice Littlefield, Babbitt takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) aside to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) privately. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) wants Ted to go to college, Babbitt accepts that Ted himself wants to drop out and work as a mechanic. Babbitt explains to his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) son that he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) never did anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) wanted to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) life. Therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) urges Ted to resist the heavy pressure to conform to the expectations of others. Babbitt acknowledges that it is too late for him (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) to rebel, but Ted still has a chance to achieve happiness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Babbitt</b></font>) own terms.
