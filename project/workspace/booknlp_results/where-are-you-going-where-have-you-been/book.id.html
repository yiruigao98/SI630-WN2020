Her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) mother scolds her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) for admiring herself in the mirror, but Connie ignores her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) mother's criticisms. Connie's mother urges her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to be neat and responsible like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) older sister, June. June, who is twenty-four and still lives at home, works as a secretary at Connie's high school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) saves money, helps their parents, and receives constant praise for her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) maturity, whereas Connie spends her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) time daydreaming. Their father works a lot and rarely talks to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughters, but their mother never stops nagging Connie. Connie is often so miserable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) mother were dead. Connie is grateful for June for setting one good precedent: June goes out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) girlfriends, so their mother allows Connie to go out as well, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) best friend. Connie's friend's father drives them to a shopping plaza in town and returns later to pick them up, never asking how they spent their time. The girls often sneak across the highway to a drive-in restaurant and meet boys. One night, a boy named Eddie invites Connie to eat dinner with him (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>), and Connie leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) friend at the restaurant's counter to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). As they walk through the parking lot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) sees a man in a gold convertible. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiles at her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) and says, <div class="bookquote">``Gonna get you, baby.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Connie hurries away, and Eddie notices nothing. They spend three hours together, at a restaurant and then in an alley. Connie spends the summer avoiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) mother's prying questions and dreaming about the boys she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) meets. One Sunday, her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) parents and June leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) at home alone while they go to a family barbeque. Connie washes her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) hair and dozes while she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) lets it dry in the sun. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) gets hot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) goes inside and listens to the radio. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) is startled by the noise of a car coming up her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) driveway. From the window she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) sees that it's a gold convertible, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) grows afraid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) walks into the kitchen, looks out the screen door, and realizes that the driver is the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) saw in the parking lot the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) met Eddie. The man grins and begins talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>). Connie is careful not to show any interest and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) several times that she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) does not know who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets out of the car and points to the words painted on the door. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name, Arnold Friend, is written next to a picture of a round smiling face, which Connie thinks resembles a pumpkin with sunglasses. There is another man in the car, whom Arnold introduces as his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) friend Ellie. Arnold asks Connie to get in the car, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) has <div class="bookquote">``things''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) laughs, and Connie notices he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) seems unsteady on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) asks how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) name, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) knows a lot of things about her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) rattles off the names of her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) friends and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) where her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) parents are. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) demands to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) is thinking and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) that today she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) is going for a ride with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) asks whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) sign, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) draws a large X in the air. Connie thinks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) recognizes parts of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) does not know how or from where. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) how old he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) stops smiling and says they are the same age, or maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)'s just a little older, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) immediately knows is a lie. To distract her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) makes fun of Ellie, who is listening to music in the car. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) too looks much older than Connie, which makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) feel dizzy with fear. Connie tells Arnold he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) should leave, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) insists on taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) for a ride. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) recognizes his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) voice as the voice of a man on the radio. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) again to leave and again grows dizzy with fear as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) starts telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) what her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) parents are doing at that precise moment at their barbeque. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) is both horrified and fascinated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) accurate descriptions. Arnold tells Connie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) lover and will give in to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) and love him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) screams that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) is crazy and begins to back away from the front door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) to leave and threatens to call the police. Arnold, moving unsteadily toward the porch, tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) will not follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) into the house--unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) touches the phone and tries to call the police. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) tries to lock to door, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) fingers are shaking too much. Arnold points out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) could break down the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) wants, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>), that after seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) that night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) was the one for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) becomes more threatening, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) doesn't come out of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)'ll do something terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) family when they come home. Arnold asks Connie whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) knows one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) neighbors, a woman who owns chickens. Connie, shocked, replies that the woman is dead. Arnold says again that she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) should come outside or her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) family will get hurt. Connie runs from the door and grabs the telephone. In a rushed, blurry scene, something happens: Connie is sweating and screaming for her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) can't dial the phone; and Arnold is <div class="bookquote">``stabbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>)... again and again with no tenderness.''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold</b></font>)</div>Oates does not say exactly what happens, but at the end of the scene, Connie is sitting on the floor, stunned and terrified. From the door, Arnold tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) to put the phone back on the hook, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) obeys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) quietly where they're going to go and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) to come outside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) thinks to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) will never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) mother again and tries to figure out what to do. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) command, she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) stands up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) feels as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) is watching herself walk toward the door, open it, and walk outside toward Arnold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) comments on her (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) blue eyes, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) has brown eyes. Connie looks out at the vast expanses of land behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) and knows that's where she (<font color='blue'><b>Connie</b></font>) is going.
