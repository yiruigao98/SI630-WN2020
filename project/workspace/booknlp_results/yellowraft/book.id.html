sections narrated by three different Native American women: Rayona,
Christine, and Ida. Rayona's narrative begins at the hospital, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) is playing cards with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) mother, Christine, who drinks heavily
and is frequently hospitalized. Rayona's father, Elgin, arrives
and argues with Christine. Rayona leaves for the parking lot and
finds Christine trying to break into their car. Christine says she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>)
is going to crash the car so Rayona can collect the life insurance
payment. Rayona forces her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) way into the car and she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) mother
drive off. Christine decides to leave their home in Seattle and
return to the reservation in Montana where she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) grew up. Christine
and Rayona spend the night packing and leave the next day. The car breaks down a mile away from Christine's mother's house,
and Christine and Rayona walk the rest of the way. Christine's mother,
Ida -LRB-whom they both call Aunt Ida-RRB-, is not glad to see Christine.
Christine runs off, leaving Rayona with Ida. Rayona does not enjoy
the reservation. Aunt Ida is cold and distant, and the other children
make fun of Rayona's dark skin. The only place Rayona finds attention
is at the local mission, where a priest named Father Tom persuades
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) to join the God Squad, a religious youth group. Father Tom invites Rayona to a religious jamboree. They
arrive early, so they stop for a while at nearby Bearpaw Lake. The
two go swimming, and Father Tom suddenly makes suggestive advances toward
Rayona. Embarrassed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) decides they should just return to the reservation.
Rayona wants to go back to Seattle, so Father Tom arranges a train
ticket for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>). Rayona intentionally misses the train and sleeps
by the tracks. The next day Rayona meets a gas station attendant
named Sky, whose wife, Evelyn, sets Rayona up with a custodial job
at Bearpaw Lake State Park. Rayona stays with Sky and Evelyn for
the whole summer and makes up a family history, telling Sky and
Evelyn that her (<font color='blue'><b>Evelyn</b></font>) parents are away for the summer. When Evelyn discovers
Rayona is lying, Rayona confesses her (<font color='blue'><b>Evelyn</b></font>) real story. Evelyn wants to take Rayona back to the reservation,
but Rayona is confident that they will find her (<font color='blue'><b>Evelyn</b></font>) mother at a nearby
rodeo. Rayona runs into Foxy Cree, one of the kids from the reservation. Foxy
is supposed to ride in the rodeo but is too drunk to do so, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Evelyn</b></font>) convinces
Rayona to ride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Evelyn</b></font>) place. Rayona performs valiantly in the rodeo
and wins a prize for her (<font color='blue'><b>Evelyn</b></font>) persistence. Dayton, who owns the horse
that Rayona rides and who is also Christine's on-and-off boyfriend,
takes Rayona back to his (<font color='blue'><b>boyfriend</b></font>) house. Christine is there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) and
Rayona immediately get in a fight. The next morning Christine and
Rayona have a conversation out in the yard. Christine tells the
story of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) faith when the world had not ended on
New Year's Day of 1960 as her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) religious teacher
had predicted it would. The narrative voice switches to Christine, whose story
begins soon after the night when the predicted end of the world
did not occur. As kids, Christine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) brother, Lee, are constant
companions. Christine is very daring until she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) loses her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) nerve one
day while trying to cross a natural bridge on a dare. A boy named
Dayton moves to the reservation and begins following Lee everywhere. Christine
decides she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) likes Dayton, and, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Dayton</b></font>) is interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>),
tries to seduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Dayton</b></font>). Dayton rejects Christine, however, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Dayton</b></font>) thinks
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) as a sister. After high school, Christine works for the tribal council
and goes out with many boys. She (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) has a fight with Ida and goes to
live with Ida's sister, Pauline. When the Vietnam War begins, Lee
tells Christine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) plans to dodge the draft but Christine tries
to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) otherwise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) knows that if Lee dodges the draft
it will hurt both her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) reputation and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) prospects for a political
career as a leader of the reservation. Dayton sees Christine's point
and persuades Lee to enlist. Christine leaves the reservation for Seattle, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>)
goes through many jobs and apartments. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) receives a letter from
Dayton saying that Lee is missing in action. That night she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) meets
an army corporal named Elgin in a bar and they begin a relationship.
Christine eventually realizes she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) is pregnant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) tells Elgin and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) proposes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>). Christine and Elgin grow apart after their wedding.
Just before her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) baby is born, Christine receives a letter from Dayton
saying that Lee is dead. Christine names her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) baby girl Rayona and
leaves Elgin when Rayona is nine months old. The two get back together
occasionally, but it never lasts long. The army finally returns Lee's body to the reservation,
and Christine takes Rayona to the funeral. Christine discovers that
everyone on the reservation blames her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) for Lee's death because she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>)
had encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) to enlist. Christine returns to Seattle and tries
to do a good job of raising Rayona. Ida stays with them for a week
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) is in town to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) aunt Clara in the hospital, but
returns to the reservation. Christine's doctor tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) liver and pancreas
are near failure and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) only has about six months left to
live. She (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) does not know how to react and tries to pretend everything
is normal when Rayona comes to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>). Christine tries to reconcile
with Elgin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) leaves the hospital abruptly. Christine decides
her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) only option is to crash her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) car so Rayona can collect the insurance money.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) tries to break into the car but Rayona catches her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) and they
drive off together. Christine again plans to kill herself by crashing
but is thwarted when the car runs out of gas. Christine then decides
to return to the reservation so that Ida can look after Rayona when
Christine dies. Ida is not glad to see Christine, so Christine runs off.
Foxy picks Christine up on the roadside and drives her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) to Dayton's
house. Christine's arrival surprises Dayton, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dayton</b></font>) takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) in.
The two settle into a comfortable routine, but Christine grows sicker.
One day Ida comes over and says that Rayona has gone missing. Foxy and
Dayton go to a rodeo with one of Dayton's horses. Dayton returns
with Rayona, who promptly gets in a fight with Christine. The next
morning, however, Christine and Rayona seem to have reconciled somewhat,
and Christine teaches Rayona to drive. Several weeks later, the
two take a road trip and have lunch together at a diner. The narrative voice switches to Ida. When Ida is a girl,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) mother becomes sick, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) aunt Clara comes to help around
the house. Ida likes Clara from the start, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) father, Lecon,
acts strangely around Clara. One night, Ida comes home to find both
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) mother and Clara crying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) learns that Clara is pregnant and
that Lecon is the father. Lecon is worried about the shame this
pregnancy will bring on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) family, so Clara suggests that the family
claim that the child is Ida's. They consult with Father Hurlburt,
a trusted priest from the local mission, who suggests a motherhouse
in Colorado where Clara can go to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) baby. The nuns at the motherhouse in Colorado name Clara's
baby Christine. Clara wants to give Christine up for adoption, but
Ida refuses and takes Christine back to Montana while Clara stays
in Colorado. Ida raises Christine until Clara returns several years
later and says she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) has lined up a family to adopt Christine. Ida
wants to keep Christine, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) has Father Hurlburt bring over the
documents that say Ida is Christine's legal mother. Clara is furious
and leaves. Ida's mother dies, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) father runs off, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sister,
Pauline, gets married. Willard Pretty Dog, a boy from the reservation
whom Ida had a crush on in high school, returns from World War II
badly disfigured by a land mine. Ida and Willard end up in a relationship
and live together. While Willard is in the hospital for reconstructive
surgery, Ida realizes she (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) is pregnant. When Willard's operation
successfully restores his (<font color='blue'><b>Willard</b></font>) good looks, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willard</b></font>) mother tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Willard</b></font>) to dump
Ida because he (<font color='blue'><b>Willard</b></font>) can now have any girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Willard</b></font>) wants. Willard replies that
even though Ida is neither pretty nor smart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) is loyal, and for
that reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Willard</b></font>) wants to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>). But after Ida hears Willard's
assessment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) no longer wants to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willard</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willard</b></font>) goes
home. Ida's son, Lee, is born and is a fussy child. One day
Lee comes home bragging that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) had to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) sister, Christine,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) got scared trying to cross a natural bridge. From that
point, Lee becomes more confident as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) grows older, while Christine
turns inward and becomes devoutly religious. Christine suddenly
begins to fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Christine</b></font>) is going to hell. Ida consults Father Hurlburt,
who says Christine's fears likely stem from a religious prophecy
that has caught on among some of the kids in Christine's school.
The prophecy claims that the world will end on New Year's Day of 1960,
when the pope is to open a letter supposedly written by the Virgin
Mary. Ida humors Christine and follows all of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) instructions in
preparing for the apocalypse. When New Year's Eve comes without
any signs that the world is ending, Lee mocks both Christine and
Ida, and Christine goes to bed very upset. Early on New Year's morning, Father
Hurlburt stops by Ida's house. The two go up to sit on the roof,
and in the darkness Ida begins to braid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) hair.
