A lake serves as natural scenery behind the stage. Medvedenko, a poor schoolteacher, believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) would be a happier man and a more attractive suitor to Masha if he (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) had more money. Masha, the daughter of the estate manager, Shamrayev, fixates on her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) love for Treplev and does not agree. Snorting snuff, Masha openly acknowledges that she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) knows Medvedenko loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) but explains that she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) cannot love him (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) back. Treplev is nervous and busy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) gets things ready for the first performance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) play. Treplev tells Sorin that Arkadina is jealous of his (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) play and hates it before she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) has seen it. Treplev picks a flower and pulls off its feathers saying, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) loves me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) loves me not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Treplev</b></font>)</div>etc.. He (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) concludes that Arkadina does not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) longs to be accepted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) peers, the writers, actors and other artists who comprise the Russian intelligentsia and artistic elite based on his (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) own work, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) is the son of famous actors. Nina arrives. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) tells Treplev that her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) parents are afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) will want to become an actress if she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) spends time with the bohemians at Sorin's estate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) says that it is the lake that attracts her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) to the estate, <div class="bookquote">``as if I were a seagull.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Nina and Treplev kiss. Treplev tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>), but Nina does not return his (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) affectionate talk. Workers and guests interrupt their intimate moment. We learn that Paulina loves Dorn and that they are involved in a romantic relationship but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) is mostly apathetic about her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) affection. Arkadina shows off to the group by reciting lines of Gertrude in Shakespeare's play, Hamlet. Treplev responds by reciting Hamlet's lines back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) lines compare Arkadina's relationship with Trigorin to Gertrude's tainted relationship with Claudius. Treplev's play begins and recites a long monologue about a universal soul and man's place on earth into infinity. It is abstract and symbolic. Arkadina rudely interrupts the performance several times by talking out loud to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) friends in the audience. When a special effect of red lights in the form of two eyes and the smell of sulpher rises in a cloud from the stage, Arkadina makes such a fuss that Treplev ends the play and closes the curtain. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) runs off. Nina meets Trigorin for the first time. Arkadina laughs at Nina's awe of Trigorin's role as a creator. Treplev desperately desires Nina but learns that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) has already left. He (<font color='blue'><b>creator</b></font>) runs off. Masha takes a pinch of snuff. Dorn criticizes her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) admits to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) is in love with Treplev. Dorn sighs over the abundance of unrequited love in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) presence. Shamrayev and Arkadina argue about the use of the horses. Arkadina wants to use them later in the day to go into town. Shamrayev has them out in the field. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) stubbornly will not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) to use them later. She (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) threatens to leave the estate and return to the country. Nina gives Dorn a bouquet of fresh picked flowers. Paulina takes the flowers from him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) and destroys them. Nina is the only one left onstage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) comments that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) is surprised that Arkadina and Trigorin act like normal people even though they are famous. Treplev enters with a rifle and a dead seagull in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) puts the seagull at Nina's feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) shot the bird in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) honor and that one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) will be like the seagull. Nina and Treplev fight about their relationship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) accuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) of talking in symbols. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) laments her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) change from warm to cold. Treplev expresses his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) conclusion that Nina stopped loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) because his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) play was a failure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) compares Nina's faded love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) to the lake disappearing into the ground. Treplev exits bitterly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) sees Nina's fondness for Trigorin. Trigorin brings up the news that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) and Arkadina are leaving the estate to go back to town. Trigorin explains the obsessive-compulsive behavior that forces him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) to document everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) observes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) memory and on paper for future use in a story. Trigorin sees the seagull that Treplev shot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) writes down a note about Nina, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) has inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) to start a new story about a girl who is ruined by a man just like the seagull that Treplev destroyed, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has nothing better to do. Arkadina interrupts Trigorin and Nina when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) calls to Trigorin announcing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) has been convinced to stay on the estate. Contrary to the conclusion of Act Two when Arkadina decides to stay, Act Three begins with Trigorin eating lunch in Sorin's dining room, surrounded by packed luggage. Masha keeps Trigorin company, confessing her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) plan to marry Medvedenko. Nina gives Trigorin a parting gift of a medallion with his (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) initials inscribed on one side and the title of his (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) book, <div class="bookquote">``Days and Nights''  (<font color='red'><b>Nina</b></font>)</div>on the other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) two minutes more before he (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) leaves. Trigorin discovers that inscribed on the medallion is a page and line number from his (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) book. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) goes off stage to find the book in order to read the quote to which Nina's gift refers, Arkadina argues with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) brother, Sorin about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) joining them into town. Sorin falls ill for a few moments and Arkadina becomes frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) screams for help. Treplev asks Arkadina to change the bandage on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) head. They share some tender moments of lightheartedness but their conversation disintegrates into name- calling, insults, and competitiveness. Treplev ends up crying because he (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) mourns the loss of Nina's affection. Arkadina tries to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) up and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) that Nina will soon come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) because Arkadina is taking Trigorin away from the estate. Trigorin enters, mumbling the line from Nina's inscription, <div class="bookquote">``If you ever need my life, come take it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Nina</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) muses over the line and it means something to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) asks Arkadina if they can stay. Arkadina challenges Trigorin about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) interest in Nina, bringing to the forefront, the tension that has existed only in silence. Trigorin portrays himself as a man who missed out on the splendors and excitement of youthful love because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youth writing to make a name for himself. Fearing the loss of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) loves, Arkadina pleads, kisses, flatters, and begs on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) hands and knees for Trigorin to leave with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) persuasive talk convinces Trigorin to leave, but, when Nina and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) catch a few private moments before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaves, Nina tells Trigorin her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) plan to move to Moscow at once and to try her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) luck at an acting career. Trigorin tells Nina to stay at the Slavyansky Bazaar Hotel. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) gets there. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rushes off to get in the carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steals a long passionate kiss from Nina, sealing their promise to meet again. It is two years later than Act Three. On a stormy night, Medvedenko and Masha discuss Sorin's request to see Treplev as his (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) health fades. Medvedenko pleads with Masha to go home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) to their baby. Masha refuses. Masha makes a bed for Sorin on the divan. Paulina comments that no one thought Kostya would become a genuine writer, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) is making money writing and looks handsome. Masha tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) mother that Medvedenko has been offered a teaching job in another district, and they are to move away in a month. Dorn asks Treplev about Nina's life now. Treplev tells Dorn that Nina had an affair with Trigorin and became pregnant. But, the baby died and Trigorin left her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) for Arkadina whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) was with while he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) impregnated Nina, cheating on them both. Treplev recounts how Nina played starring roles in summer theater plays outside of Moscow that moved to the provinces but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) played her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) parts badly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) used to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) on the road and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) perform, but Nina refused to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>). Treplev eventually gave up on following her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) around. Nina would send Treplev troubled letters and sign them, <div class="bookquote">``The Seagull.''  (<font color='red'><b>Treplev</b></font>)</div>Treplev compares Nina's signature to a character in a Pushkin play who signs his (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) name, <div class="bookquote">``The Raven.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pushkin</b></font>)</div>Treplev reveals the information that Nina is staying nearby in town at a hotel. Masha went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>), but Nina refused to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) and Medvedenko swears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Medvedenko</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) walking through a nearby field. Nina's parents have hired armed guards to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) away from their house next door to Sorin's estate. Trigorin brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) a copy of the latest magazine in which a story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) is published. Arkadina begins a game of lotto. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) recalls her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) family's tradition of playing the game to pass the time. Treplev notices that Trigorin read his (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) own story in the magazine but did not bother to read Treplev's. Shamrayev tells Trigorin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) stuffed the seagull that Treplev shot for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>). Trigorin does not remember asking Shamrayev to stuff and mount it. Arkadina calls everyone to dinner and asks Treplev to stop writing. Treplev is left alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) study. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) looks over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) writing and criticizes himself out loud for being cliché. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) compares his (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) writing to Trigorin's with envy and despair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) hears a knock on the window. It is Nina. Nina enters the house paranoid about Arkadina finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) there and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Sorin</b></font>) to lock the door. Treplev props a chair against the door. Nina and Treplev admit to each other that they have sought each other. Nina's speech becomes fractured and confusing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) cuts off her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) own thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``the Seagull''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and compares herself to a homeless wanderer in a Turgenev story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) cries. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) feels better because she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) has not cried in two years. Nina acknowledges that Treplev is now a writer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) became an actress but her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) life is difficult. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) thinks nostalgically about their youth and their youthful love. Treplev professes his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) love to Nina and recounts his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) torment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>), how nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) has accomplished has been meaningful to him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) was not present to share in his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) successes. Nina tells Treplev about the depression she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) suffered when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) realized she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) was a bad actor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) story breaks down, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) repeats Trigorin's idea for a story about a girl who is destroyed like the seagull by a man who has nothing better to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) concludes that what is important for an artist is not how successful you are but that you persevere. Nina becomes weaker. Treplev asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) to stay. Nina confesses to Treplev that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) still profoundly loves Trigorin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) remembers the innocence and hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) and Treplev felt the summer they put on their play. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) recites lines from the play. Nina hugs Treplev and then runs out of the door. Treplev proceeds to tear up his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) manuscripts and throws them under his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) desk. Arkadina and the rest of the household come back from dinner and start another game of lotto. Dorn pushes in the door that Treplev propped closed with a chair. Shamrayev presents Trigorin with the stuffed seagull. Again, Trigorin says he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) does not remember asking for it to be stuffed. A shot goes off in a loud bang, offstage. Arkadina becomes frightened. Dorn calms her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) down presenting the thought that the sound was probably only a popped cork in a bottle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) medicine bag. Dorn goes to check on the sound and comes back to the group. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) takes a magazine and brings Trigorin aside, pretending he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) is interested in discussing an article on America. Dorn tells Trigorin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorn</b></font>) needs to get Irina Arkadina out of the house quickly because Treplev has shot himself. Arkadina does not hear Dorn's sad news before the play's end.
