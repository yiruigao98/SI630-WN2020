in the life of its narrator, Jack Gladney, a college professor in
a small American town. The novel itself can be hard to follow, since
Jack spends much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) time detailing seemingly inconsequential
conversations, and several events in the novel have no direct impact
on the action of the story. Despite these tangents, a general plotline
emerges from the narrative. Jack teaches at a school called the College-on-the-Hill,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) serves as the department chair of Hitler studies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) lives
in Blacksmith, a quiet college town, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) wife, Babette, and
four of their children from earlier marriages: Heinrich, Steffie,
Denise, and Wilder. Throughout the novel, various half-siblings
and ex-spouses drift in and out of the family's home. Jack loves
Babette very much, taking great comfort in her (<font color='blue'><b>Babette</b></font>) honesty and openness
and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sees as her (<font color='blue'><b>Babette</b></font>) reassuring solidness and domesticity. Jack invented the discipline of Hitler studies in 1968,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) acknowledges that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) capitalizes on Hitler's importance as
a historical figure, which lends Jack an air of dignity and significance
by association. Over the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) career, Jack has consciously made
many decisions in order to strengthen his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own reputation and add
a certain heft to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) personal identity: when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) began the department,
for example, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) added an initial to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) name to make it sound more
prestigious. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is continually aware of the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) aura and
persona were deliberately crafted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) worries about being exposed
as a fraud. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) great shame, Jack can't speak German, so when
a Hitler conference gets scheduled at the College-on-the-Hill, Jack
secretly begins taking German lessons. Hitler studies shares a building with the American environments department,
which is mainly staffed by what Jack refers to as the <div class="bookquote">``New York
émigrés,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>a tough, sarcastic group of men obsessed with American
popular culture. Jack befriends one of these professors, a former
sportswriter named Murray Jay Siskind. Murray has come to Blacksmith
to immerse himself in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) calls <div class="bookquote">``American magic and dread.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Murray finds deep significance in ordinary, everyday events and
locations--particularly the supermarket, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) claims contains
massive amounts of psychic data. The majority of the novel is structured around two major
plot points: the airborne toxic event, and Jack's discovery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
wife's participation in an experimental study of a new psychopharmaceutical
called Dylar. One day, Jack finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son Heinrich on the roof of the
house, watching a billowing cloud of smoke rise into the sky. Heinrich
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Heinrich</b></font>) that a train car has derailed and caught on fire, releasing
a poisonous toxic substance into the air. The entire town of Blacksmith
is ordered to evacuate to an abandoned Boy Scout camp. While at
the evacuation camp, Jack learns that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s been exposed to Nyodene
D., a lethal chemical. The technician tells Jack that the chemical
lasts thirty years in the human body and that in fifteen years they'll
be able to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) a more definitive answer about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chances for
survival. Perhaps due to the vagueness of this explanation, Jack becomes
preoccupied with the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) has now been marked for death.
The townspeople remain evacuated from their homes for nine more
days. After the toxic cloud disappears, the sunsets in Blacksmith
become shockingly beautiful. Meanwhile, Babette's daughter Denise discovers a vial
of pills, labeled Dylar, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Denise</b></font>) mother has been taking in secret.
Babette evades both Denise's and Jack's inquiries, so Jack takes
a pill to Winnie Richards, a scientist at College-on-the-Hill. After
analyzing the pill, Winnie tells Jack that the drug is an incredibly
advanced kind of psychopharmaceutical. Jack finally confronts Babette
about the pills. In tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Babette</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that Dylar is an experimental,
unlicensed drug, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Babette</b></font>) believes can cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Babette</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Babette</b></font>) obsessive
fear of dying. In order to get samples of the drug, Babette admits
to having had an affair with the Dylar project manager, a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Babette</b></font>)
refers to only as Mr. Gray. In return, Jack confesses to Babette
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fatal Nyodene D. exposure. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fear of death now greater
than ever, Jack goes in search of Babette's remaining Dylar pills,
only to find that Denise has thrown them all away. Jack begins to have problems sleeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) goes in for
frequent medical checkups and becomes preoccupied with clearing
all the unused clutter out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stays awake late into
the night to watch the children sleep. One evening, Wilder wakes
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilder</b></font>) up, and Jack finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father-in-law, Vernon Hickey, asleep
in the backyard. Vernon, a tough, aging handyman, has come by for
a surprise visit. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) leaves, Vernon secretly gives Jack a
handgun. Shortly afterward, Jack confides in Murray about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) acute
death fixation. Murray proposes the theory that killing someone
else can alleviate the fear of death. Jack begins to think of the
gun at odd moments, eventually bringing it to class with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) one
afternoon. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) way home from campus, Jack runs into Winnie Richards, who
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Richards</b></font>) read an article on the project manager responsible
for Dylar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Richards</b></font>) tells Jack the man's name, Willie Mink, and the approximate
location of the motel he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s now living in. Armed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) gun, Jack
finds Willie Mink, disheveled and half-crazy, in the same motel
room where Mink conducted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) affair with Babette. Jack plans to
kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), and, after a brief conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pulls out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) gun
and shoots Mink twice. In an attempt to make it look like a suicide,
Jack places the gun in Mink's hand, only to be shot in the wrist by
Mink a moment later. Overcome by a sense of humanity, Jack drives
Mink to the nearest hospital--which is run by atheist German nuns--and
saves his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) life. Jack returns home and watches the children sleep. Later
that day, Wilder rides his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) tricycle across the highway and miraculously
survives, an event that finally allows Jack to let go of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fear
of death and obsession with health and safety hazards. Jack, Babette,
and Wilder take in the spectacular sunsets from the overpass. Jack
closes the novel with a description of the supermarket, which has
rearranged its aisles, throwing everyone into a state of confusion.
