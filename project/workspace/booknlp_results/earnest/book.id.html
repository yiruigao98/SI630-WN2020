a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian
to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of
the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was a
baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is a major
landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a
number of servants and other employees all dependent on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). For
years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep
brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure
and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack
to rush grimly off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely
Jack's alibi, a phantom that allows him (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) to disappear for days at
a time and do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) likes. No one but Jack knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) himself
is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) really goes on these occasions--probably to pursue the very sort
of behavior he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pretends to disapprove of in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) imaginary brother. Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon,
who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found
an inscription inside Jack's cigarette case addressed to <div class="bookquote">``Uncle Jack''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>from someone who refers to herself as <div class="bookquote">``little Cecily.''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>Algernon
suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) seems
to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) calls
a person who leads a double life a <div class="bookquote">``Bunburyist,''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>after a nonexistent
friend he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to
whose deathbed he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is forever being summoned whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wants to
get out of some tiresome social obligation. At the beginning of Act I, Jack drops in unexpectedly
on Algernon and announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon
confronts him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) with the cigarette case and forces him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to come clean,
demanding to know who <div class="bookquote">``Jack''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Cecily''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>are. Jack confesses that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) name isn't really Ernest and that Cecily is his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ward, a responsibility
imposed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) adoptive father's will. Jack also tells Algernon
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fictional brother. Jack says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s been thinking of killing
off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active
an interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in
terms that catch Algernon's attention and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) even more interested
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is already. Gwendolen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which
gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted
to discover that Gwendolen returns his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) affections, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is alarmed
to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>)
says <div class="bookquote">``inspires absolute confidence.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen makes clear that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) would not consider marrying a man who was not named
Ernest. Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eligibility
as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) asks about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) family background. When Jack explains that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) has no idea who
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) parents were and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was found, by the man who adopted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), in
a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out
of the house. In Act II, Algernon shows up at Jack's country
estate posing as Jack's brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having
decided that Ernest has outlived his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) usefulness, arrives home in
deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly
in Paris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest
but has to go along with the charade. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) doesn't, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) own lies
and deceptions will be revealed. While Jack changes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mourning clothes, Algernon,
who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) to marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that
they are engaged, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is charmed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) reveals that her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) fascination with
<div class="bookquote">``Uncle Jack's brother''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>led her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) to invent an elaborate romance between
herself and him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to
learn that part of Cecily's interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) derives from the name
Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) says <div class="bookquote">``inspires
absolute confidence.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local
rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile,
Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit.
Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and
attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures
into Jack's life, and Gwendolen, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) part, has no idea who Cecily
is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor
House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Worthing's
ward.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecily</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward,
and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing
who is her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) guardian but his (<font color='blue'><b>Worthing</b></font>) brother Jack and, in fact, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>)
is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out
that this is impossible as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing.
The tea party degenerates into a war of manners. Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation,
each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be
christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points
out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) fianc√© is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that
hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where
Jack's brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>). Jack is forced to admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) has no brother and that
Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious,
and they retire to the house arm in arm. Act III takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where
Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter
from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon
why he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pretended to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) guardian's brother. Algernon tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did it in order to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>). Gwendolen asks Jack whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pretended
to have a brother in order to come into London to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) as often
as possible, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) interprets his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) evasive reply as an affirmation.
The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue
of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and
Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest
that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace.
At this moment, Lady Bracknell's arrival is announced. Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed
Gwendolen's maid to reveal her (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) destination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) demands to know
what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>)
engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between
them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
engagement to Cecily, prompting her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) to inspect Cecily and inquire
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) social connections, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) does in a routine and patronizing
manner that infuriates Jack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) replies to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) questions with
a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the
last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth
a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) comes
of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested. Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily's legal guardian,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) refuses to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) consent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) union with Algernon. Lady
Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes
of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) grandfather's
will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she (<font color='blue'><b>Cecily</b></font>) is thirty-five.
Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) points out that the
matter is entirely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) own hands. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) consents to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) consent to marry Algernon.
However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) and
Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives
and happens to mention Cecily's governess, Miss Prism. At this,
Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for. When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>)
begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) of having
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) sister's house twenty-eight years before with a baby and
never returned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism
confesses she (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) doesn't know, explaining that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) lost the baby, having
absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) had meant to
place the manuscript for a novel she (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) had written. Jack asks what
happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) left it in the cloakroom
of a railway station. Jack presses her (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) for further details and goes
racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag.
When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bracknell</b></font>) with a cry of <div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>It takes a while before the situation
is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not
the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of
Lady Bracknell's sister and, therefore, Algernon's older brother.
Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened <div class="bookquote">``Ernest John.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
name, as is Jack, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) does have an unprincipled younger brother--Algernon.
Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit,
and Jack acknowledges that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) now understands <div class="bookquote">``the vital Importance
of Being Earnest.''
