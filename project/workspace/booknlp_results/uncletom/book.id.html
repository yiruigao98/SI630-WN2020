Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby faces the prospect of losing
everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) owns. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) wife, Emily Shelby, have a
kindhearted and affectionate relationship with their slaves, Shelby
decides to raise money by selling two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) slaves to Mr. Haley,
a coarse slave trader. The slaves in question are Uncle Tom, a middle-aged
man with a wife and children on the farm, and Harry, the young son
of Mrs. Shelby's maid Eliza. When Shelby tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) wife about his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>)
agreement with Haley, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is appalled because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has promised Eliza
that Shelby would not sell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) son. However, Eliza overhears the conversation between Shelby
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) wife and, after warning Uncle Tom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wife, Aunt Chloe,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) takes Harry and flees to the North, hoping to find freedom with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) husband George in Canada. Haley pursues her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>), but two other Shelby
slaves alert Eliza to the danger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) miraculously evades capture
by crossing the half-frozen Ohio River, the boundary separating
Kentucky from the North. Haley hires a slave hunter named Loker
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) gang to bring Eliza and Harry back to Kentucky. Eliza and
Harry make their way to a Quaker settlement, where the Quakers agree
to help transport them to safety. They are joined at the settlement
by George, who reunites joyously with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) family for the trip to
Canada. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom sadly leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) family and Mas'r George,
Shelby's young son and Tom's friend, as Haley takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) to a boat
on the Mississippi to be transported to a slave market. On the boat,
Tom meets an angelic little white girl named Eva, who quickly befriends
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). When Eva falls into the river, Tom dives in to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>),
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father, Augustine St. Clare, gratefully agrees to buy Tom
from Haley. Tom travels with the St. Clares to their home in New
Orleans, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) grows increasingly invaluable to the St. Clare
household and increasingly close to Eva, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shares a devout
Christianity. Up North, George and Eliza remain in flight from Loker
and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) men. When Loker attempts to capture them, George shoots
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in the side, and the other slave hunters retreat. Eliza convinces
George and the Quakers to bring Loker to the next settlement, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can be healed. Meanwhile, in New Orleans, St. Clare discusses
slavery with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cousin Ophelia, who opposes slavery as an institution
but harbors deep prejudices against blacks. St. Clare, by contrast,
feels no hostility against blacks but tolerates slavery because
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) feels powerless to change it. To help Ophelia overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) bigotry,
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) buys Topsy, a young black girl who was abused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) past master and
arranges for Ophelia to begin educating her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>). After Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years,
Eva grows very ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) slowly weakens, then dies, with a vision
of heaven before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) death has a profound effect on everyone
who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>): Ophelia resolves to love the slaves, Topsy learns
to trust and feel attached to others, and St. Clare decides to set
Tom free. However, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can act on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) decision, St. Clare
is stabbed to death while trying to settle a brawl. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dies,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at last finds God and goes to be reunited with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother in
heaven. St. Clare's cruel wife, Marie, sells Tom to a vicious
plantation owner named Simon Legree. Tom is taken to rural Louisiana
with a group of new slaves, including Emmeline, whom the demonic
Legree has purchased to use as a sex slave, replacing his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) previous
sex slave Cassy. Legree takes a strong dislike to Tom when Tom refuses to
whip a fellow slave as ordered. Tom receives a severe beating, and Legree
resolves to crush his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) faith in God. Tom meets Cassy, and hears her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
story. Separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) daughter by slavery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) became pregnant
again but killed the child because she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not stand to have another
child taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). Around this time, with the help of Tom Loker--now a changed man
after being healed by the Quakers--George, Eliza, and Harry at last
cross over into Canada from Lake Erie and obtain their freedom.
In Louisiana, Tom's faith is sorely tested by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hardships, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
nearly ceases to believe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has two visions, however--one of Christ
and one of Eva--which renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) spiritual strength and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) the
courage to withstand Legree's torments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) encourages Cassy to escape.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) does so, taking Emmeline with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), after she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) devises a ruse
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) and Emmeline pretend to be ghosts. When Tom refuses
to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) overseers to beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). When Tom is near death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) forgives Legree
and the overseers. George Shelby arrives with money in hand to buy
Tom's freedom, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is too late. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can only watch as Tom dies
a martyr's death. Taking a boat toward freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George
Harris's sister and travel with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to Canada, where Cassy realizes
that Eliza is her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) long-lost daughter. The newly reunited family
travels to France and decides to move to Liberia, the African nation
created for former American slaves. George Shelby returns to the
Kentucky farm, where, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) father's death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) sets all the slaves
free in honor of Tom's memory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) urges them to think on Tom's sacrifice
every time they look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cabin and to lead a pious Christian
life, just as Tom did.
