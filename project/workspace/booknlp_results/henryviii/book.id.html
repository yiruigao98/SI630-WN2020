Several lords, including Buckingham, enter; Buckingham is angry that Cardinal Wolsey has such powerful influence over the king. Buckingham suspects Wolsey of being ambitious and disloyal. The other lords urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>) to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>) words to himself, but just then, a guard comes to arrest Buckingham with the charge of treason. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>) goes quietly to jail. The king and queen attend a hearing in which Wolsey questions Buckingham's former employee -LRB-the Surveyor-RRB- about his (<font color='blue'><b>Surveyor</b></font>) loyalties. This man declares that Buckingham fancied himself next in line to the throne should the king die without an heir. Henry is angered and sentences Buckingham to death for disloyalty. However, the queen thinks that the Surveyor bears a grudge against Buckingham and has delivered lies in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>) testimony. Many lords go to a dinner party at Wolsey's house, and the king comes in disguise. Wolsey sees through the disguise, and the king meets Anne Bullen. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is very impressed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) beauty. Several men in the street discuss the trial of Buckingham, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>) defended himself eloquently but was sentenced to death. The common people hate Wolsey, they all agree. Buckingham, speaks to the people, forgiving those who turned against him (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>) notes how his (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>) own death resembles that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buckingham</b></font>) father, who also was killed by the king to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was loyal all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) life. Several lords hear talk of the king's plan to divorce his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife, Katharine. Anne hears the news, too, and is sorry for Katharine, reflecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) herself would never want to be the queen. Then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) receives a new title and money from the king, as a sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fondness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>). A cardinal from Rome arrives with the Pope's decision about whether Henry may divorce Katharine. Katharine beseeches the king not to divorce her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>), saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) has been a loyal and honest wife to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) for two decades. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) calls Wolsey a traitor and refuses to submit to his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) will, sweeping out of the court. The king enumerates his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) reasons for believing his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) marriage to Katharine is unlawful and must be dissolved. Wolsey and the cardinal from Rome speak to Katharine, trying to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) to go along with the divorce so she (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) may stay under the king's care. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) curses them for their role in her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) demise, which enrages her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) after so much faithfulness. The lords of the court now suspect Wolsey has been double-dealing in the divorce. But before they can work out a scheme to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) down, Wolsey falls through his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own inattention. The king intercepts an inventory of the possessions Wolsey has seized from fallen lords and a letter Wolsey wrote to the Pope urging the Pope to refuse the divorce request until Henry forgets his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) infatuation with Anne. The king confronts him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and asks Wolsey if he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) has been a good servant, and Wolsey replies affirmatively. Then, the king shows him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) the papers he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) has uncovered. Wolsey knows he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is lost. The lords deliver the king's charges against Wolsey, stripping him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) title and belongings. Wolsey regrets his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ambitious behavior and sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was wrong to have tried to influence the affairs of state. Saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) finally knows himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) leaves the court. The king announces his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) marriage with Anne, and people in the street scramble to watch the procession to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) coronation. Katharine has now been demoted to <div class="bookquote">``Princess Dowager,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katharine</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) expects that her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) demise will lead soon to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) death. Hearing of the death of Wolsey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) speaks against him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) again, but one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Katharine</b></font>) attendants -LRB-Griffith-RRB- praises him (<font color='blue'><b>Griffith</b></font>). Katharine is, thus, convinced to forgive Wolsey. In the court, the lords hear that the queen -LRB-Anne-RRB- is in labor. The king discovers a plot against his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) recently returned friend Cranmer, so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) summons Cranmer to explain the complaints against him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). Cranmer is convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) will fall into traps set for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>), so the king gives him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ring as a sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) support. Meanwhile, Anne gives birth to a female child. Cranmer is called before the Council, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) is a member, to answer to complaints against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>). The king watches the proceedings from above. The lords tell Cranmer that nothing can be done about the complaints while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) is a Council member, so they want to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) into a regular citizen by confining him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) to the Tower. When guards arrives to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>) away, Cranmer shows the lords the king's ring, and the king enters the Council to scold the lords for infighting, urging them to get along with each other. Cranmer forgives those who have plotted against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cranmer</b></font>), specifically Gardiner. Commoners gather in the street to view the baptism of the king's daughter. Cranmer baptizes her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as Elizabeth and speaks of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) future greatness and the achievements both she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) successors will have. The Epilogue comes on stage, urging the audience to applaud.
