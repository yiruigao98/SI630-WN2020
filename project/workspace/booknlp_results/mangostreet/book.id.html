on Mango Street covers a year in the life of Esperanza,
a Chicana -LRB-Mexican-American girl-RRB-, who is about twelve years old
when the novel begins. During the year, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) moves with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) family
into a house on Mango Street. The house is a huge improvement from
the family's previous apartment, and it is the first home her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) parents
actually own. However, the house is not what Esperanza has dreamed
of, because it is run-down and small. The house is in the center
of a crowded Latino neighborhood in Chicago, a city where many of
the poor areas are racially segregated. Esperanza does not have
any privacy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) resolves that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) will someday leave Mango
Street and have a house all her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) own. Esperanza matures significantly during the
year, both sexually and emotionally. The novel charts her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) life as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) makes friends, grows hips, develops her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) first crush, endures
sexual assault, and begins to write as a way of expressing herself
and as a way to escape the neighborhood. The novel also includes
the stories of many of Esperanza's neighbors, giving a full picture
of the neighborhood and showing the many possible paths Esperanza
may follow in the future. After moving to the house, Esperanza quickly befriends
Lucy and Rachel, two Chicana girls who live across the street. Lucy,
Rachel, Esperanza, and Esperanza's little sister, Nenny, have many
adventures in the small space of their neighborhood. They buy a
bike, learn exciting stories about boys from a young woman named Marin,
explore a junk shop, and have intimate conversations while playing
Double Dutch -LRB-jumping rope-RRB-. The girls are on the brink of puberty
and sometimes find themselves sexually vulnerable, such as when
they walk around their neighborhood in high-heeled shoes or when
Esperanza is kissed by an older man at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) first job. During the first
half of the year, the girls are content to live and play in their child's
world. At school, Esperanza feels ashamed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) family's poverty
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) difficult-to-pronounce name. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) secretly writes poems that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) shares only with older women she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) trusts. Over the summer, Esperanza slips into puberty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) suddenly likes
it when boys watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) dance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) enjoys dreaming about them.
Esperanza's newfound sexual maturity, combined with the death of
two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) family members, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) grandfather and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) Aunt Lupe, bring
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lupe</b></font>) closer to the world of adults. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lupe</b></font>) begins to closely watch the
women in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lupe</b></font>) neighborhood. This second half of The House
on Mango Street presents a string of stories about older women
in the neighborhood, all of whom are even more stuck in their situations
and, quite literally, in their houses, than Esperanza is. Meanwhile,
during the beginning of the following school year, Esperanza befriends
Sally, a girl her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) age who is more sexually mature than
Lucy or Rachel. Sally, meanwhile, has her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) own agenda. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) uses boys
and men as an escape route from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) abusive father. Esperanza is
not completely comfortable with Sally's sexual experience, and their
friendship results in a crisis when Sally leaves Esperanza alone, and
a group of boys sexually assaults Esperanza in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) absence. Esperanza's traumatic experiences as Sally's friend, in
conjunction with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) detailed observations of the older women in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) neighborhood, cement her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) desire to escape Mango Street and to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) own house. When Esperanza finds herself emotionally ready
to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) neighborhood, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) discovers that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) will
never fully be able to leave Mango Street behind, and that after
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) leaves she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>)'ll have to return to help the women she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) has left.
At the end of the year, Esperanza remains on Mango Street, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>)
has matured extensively. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) has a stronger desire to leave and
understands that writing will help her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) put distance between herself
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) situation. Though for now writing helps her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) escape only
emotionally, in the future it may help her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) to escape physically
as well.
