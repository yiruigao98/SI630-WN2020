After he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) has received his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) diploma, Mitch approaches his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) favorite professor, Morrie Schwartz, and presents him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) with a monogrammed briefcase. While at Brandeis, Mitch takes almost all of the sociology courses Morrie had teaches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) promises Morrie, who is crying, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) will keep in touch, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) does not fulfill his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) promise. Years after Mitch's graduation from Brandeis, Morrie is forced to forfeit dancing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) favorite hobby, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) has been diagnosed with ALS, a debilitating disease that leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``soul, perfectly awake, imprisoned inside a limp husk''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of a body. Morrie's wife, Charlotte, cares for Morrie, though at his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) insistence, keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) job as a professor at M.I.T. Sixteen years after his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) graduation from Brandeis, Mitch is feeling frustrated with the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) has chosen to live. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) uncle dies of pancreatic cancer, Mitch abandons his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) failing career as a musician to become a well-paid journalist for a Detroit newspaper. Mitch promises his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) wife Janine that they will have children eventually, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) spends all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) time at work, away on reporting assignments. One night, Mitch is flipping the channels on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) television and recognizes Morrie's voice. Morrie is being featured on the television program <div class="bookquote">``Nightline''  (<font color='red'><b>Morrie</b></font>)</div>in the first of three interviews with Ted Koppel, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Ted</b></font>) quickly befriends. Before consenting to be interviewed, Morrie surprises and softens the famed newscaster when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) asks Koppel what is <div class="bookquote">``close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>Koppel</b></font>)</div>Mitch is stunned to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) former professor on television. Following Morrie's television appearance, Mitch contacts his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) beloved professor and travels from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) home in Detroit to Morrie's home in West Newton, Massachusetts to visit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>). When Mitch drives up to Morrie's house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) delays greeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) professor because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) is speaking on the phone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) producer, a decision he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) later regrets. Shortly after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) reunion with Morrie, Mitch works himself nearly to death reporting on the Wimbledon tennis tournament in London. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) spends much time thinking about Morrie and forfeits reading the tabloids, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) now seeks more meaning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) life and knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) will not gain this meaning from reading about celebrities and gossip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) is knocked over by a swarm of reporters chasing celebrities Andre Agassi and Brooke Shields, and it is then that Mitch realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) is chasing after the wrong thing. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) home in Detroit, Mitch learns that the article he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) has worked so hard to write will not even be published, as the union he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) belongs to is striking against the newspaper he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) works for. Once more, Mitch travels to Boston to visit Morrie. Following their first Tuesday together, Mitch returns regularly every Tuesday to listen to Morrie's lessons on <div class="bookquote">``The Meaning of Life.''  (<font color='red'><b>Morrie</b></font>)</div>Each week, Mitch brings Morrie food to eat, though as Morrie's condition worsens he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) is no longer able to enjoy solid food. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) first of three interviews with Koppel for <div class="bookquote">``Nightline,''  (<font color='red'><b>Koppel</b></font>)</div>Morrie admits that the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) dreads most about his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) worsening condition is that someday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) will not be able to wipe himself after using the bathroom. Eventually, this fear comes true. Interspersed throughout Mitch's visits to Morrie are flashbacks to their days together at Brandeis. Mitch describes himself as a student who had acted tough, but had sought the tenderness he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) recognized in Morrie. At Brandeis, Mitch and Morrie shared a relationship more like that between father and son than teacher and student. Soon before Morrie's death, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) condition has deteriorated so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) can no longer breathe or move on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) confides that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) could have another son, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) would choose Mitch. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) childhood, Morrie had been very poor. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) father, Charlie had been cold and dispassionate, and had neglected to provide for Morrie and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) younger brother emotionally and financially. At the age of eight, Morrie must read the telegram that brings news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) mother's death, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) is the only one in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) family who can read English. Charlie marries Eva, a kind woman who gives Morrie and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) brother the love and affection they need. Eva also instills in Morrie his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) love of books and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) desire for education. However, Charlie insists that Morrie keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) mother's death a secret, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) wants Morrie's younger brother to believe that Eva is his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) biological mother. This demand to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) mother's death a secret proves a terrible emotional burden for young Morrie; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) keeps the telegram all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) life as proof that his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) mother had existed. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) was starved of love and affection during his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) childhood, Morrie seeks it out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) old age from his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) family and friends. Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) is nearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) death, Morrie says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) has reverted to a figurative infancy, and tries in earnest <div class="bookquote">``enjoy being a baby again.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) and Mitch often hold hands throughout their sessions together. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) lessons, Morrie advises Mitch to reject the popular culture in favor of creating his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) own. The individualistic culture Morrie encourages Mitch to create for himself is a culture founded on love, acceptance, and human goodness, a culture that upholds a set of ethical values unlike the mores that popular culture endorses. Popular culture, Morrie says, is founded on greed, selfishness, and superficiality, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) urges Mitch to overcome. Morrie also stresses that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) and Mitch must accept death and aging, as both are inevitable. On one Tuesday, Janine travels with Mitch to visit Morrie. Janine is a professional singer, and Morrie asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Janine</b></font>) to sing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>). Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Janine</b></font>) does not usually sing upon request, Janine concedes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Janine</b></font>) voice moves Morrie to tears. Morrie cries freely and often, and continually encourages Mitch to do so also. As Morrie's condition deteriorates, so does that of the pink hibiscus plant that sits on the window ledge in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) study. Mitch becomes increasingly aware of the evil in media, as it drenches the country with stories of murder and hatred. One such story is the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, the verdict of which causes major racial division between whites and blacks. Mitch tape records his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) discussions with Morrie so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) may compile notes with which to write a book, Tuesdays With Morrie, a project which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) and Morrie refer to as their <div class="bookquote">``last thesis together.''  (<font color='red'><b>Morrie</b></font>)</div>Morrie continually tells Mitch that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) wants to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) stories with the world, a the book will allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) to do just that. Meanwhile, at Morrie's insistence, Mitch attempts to restore his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) relationship with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) brother Peter who lives in Spain. For many years, Peter has refused his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) family's help in battling pancreatic cancer and insists on seeking treatment alone. Mitch calls Peter and leaves numerous phone messages, though the only reply he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) receives from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) brother is a curt message in which Peter insists he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is fine, and reminds Mitch that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) does not want to talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) illness. Morrie prophetizes that Mitch will once more become close with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) brother, a prophecy which, after Morrie's death, is realized. At Morrie's funeral, Mitch recalls his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) promise to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) conversations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) professor and conducts a silent dialogue with Morrie in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morrie</b></font>) head. Mitch had expected such a dialogue to feel awkward, however this communication feels far more natural than he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitch</b></font>) had ever expected.
