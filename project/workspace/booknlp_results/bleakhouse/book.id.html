is leaving for the home of a new guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, along with
Ada Clare and Richard Carstone. On the way to the home, called Bleak
House, they stop overnight at the Jellybys' chaotic home. When they
finally reach Bleak House, they meet Mr. Jarndyce and settle in.
They meet Mr. Skimpole, a man who acts like a child. The narrator describes a ghost that lurks around Chesney
Wold, the home of Lady and Sir Leicester Dedlock. Esther meets the overbearing charity worker Mrs. Pardiggle, who
introduces her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to a poor brickmaker's wife named Jenny, whose baby
is ill. Esther says she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is sure that Ada and Richard are falling
in love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) meets Mr. Boythorn, as well as Mr. Guppy, who proposes
marriage. Esther refuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>). At Chesney Wold, Tulkinghorn shows the Dedlocks some Jarndyce
documents, and Lady Dedlock recognizes the handwriting. Tulkinghorn
says he (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>)'ll find out who did it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chesney</b></font>) asks Mr. Snagsby, the law-stationer,
who says a man named Nemo wrote the documents. Tulkinghorn visits
Nemo, who lives above a shop run by a man named Krook, and finds
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dead. At the coroner's investigation, a street urchin named
Jo is questioned and says that Nemo was nice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nemo</b></font>). Later, Tulkinghorn
tells Lady Dedlock what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nemo</b></font>)'s learned. Richard struggles to find a suitable career, eventually
deciding to pursue medicine. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is more interested in the Jarndyce
and Jarndyce lawsuit, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) believes will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) rich. Neither Esther
nor the narrator ever fully explains the lawsuit, because nobody
remembers what originally prompted the parties to begin the suit. In London, Esther meets a young girl named Charlotte who
is caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) two young siblings. A lodger who lives in the
same building, Mr. Gridley, helps care for the children as well. A mysterious lady approaches Jo and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
where Nemo is buried. Mr. Jarndyce tells Esther some details about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) background.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) reveals that the woman who raised Esther was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) aunt. The next day,
a doctor named Mr. Woodcourt visits before leaving on a trip to China
and India. An unidentified person leaves a bouquet of flowers for
Esther. Richard begins working in the law. Esther, Ada, and others
visit Mr. Boythorn, who lives near Chesney Wold. There, Esther meets Lady
Dedlock for the first time and feels a strange connection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Lady
Dedlock has a French maid, Mademoiselle Hortense, who is jealous
that Lady Dedlock has a new young protégée named Rosa. A man named Mr. Jobling, a friend of Mr. Guppy's, moves
into Nemo's old room above Krook's shop. Two men, George and Grandfather Smallweed, talk about
some money that George owes Smallweed. They reach an agreement,
and George leaves. Tulkinghorn introduces Bucket and Snagsby, and Snagsby
introduces Bucket to Jo. Bucket figures out that the woman Jo led
to the burial ground was disguised in Mademoiselle Hortense's clothes. Mademoiselle
Hortense soon quits her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) post at Chesney Wold. Caddy Jellyby tells Esther she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is engaged to Prince Turveydrop. Charley
Neckett becomes Esther's maid. Mr. Jarndyce warns Ada and Richard
to end their romantic relationship since Richard is joining the
army. Gridley dies. Smallweed visits George and says that Captain Hawdon,
a man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought was dead, is actually alive, and that a lawyer
was asking about some handwriting of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) asks George if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has
any handwriting to offer. George visits Tulkinghorn, who explains
that George will be rewarded if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gives up some of Hawdon's handwriting.
George refuses. Guppy visits Lady Dedlock in London and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thinks there
is a connection between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) and Esther. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says that Esther's former
guardian was someone named Miss Barbary and that Esther's real name
was Esther Hawdon. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says that Nemo was actually named Hawdon,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nemo</b></font>) left some letters, which Guppy will get. When Guppy
leaves, Lady Dedlock cries: Esther is her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) daughter, who her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) sister
claimed had died at birth. Charley and Esther visit Jenny and find Jo lying on the
floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) is sick, and Esther takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) back to Bleak House, putting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) up in the stable. In the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) has disappeared. Charley
gets very ill. Then Esther gets extremely ill. Guppy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) friend Jobling want to get Hawdon's letters
from Krook. But when they go down to Krook's shop, they find that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) has spontaneously combusted. Later, Grandfather Smallweed arrives
to take care of Krook's property. Guppy eventually tells Lady Dedlock
the letters were destroyed. Smallweed demands payment from George and the Bagnets,
on whose behalf he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) borrowed the money. Desperate, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tells Tulkinghorn
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll turn over the Hawdon's handwriting if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll leave the Bagnets
alone. Esther recovers slowly. Miss Flite visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>), telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that a mysterious woman visited Jenny's cottage, asking about
Esther and taking away a handkerchief Esther had left. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) also
tells Esther that Mr. Woodcourt has returned. Esther goes to Mr.
Boythorn's house to recover fully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) looks in a mirror for the
first time and sees that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) face is terribly scarred from the smallpox.
While there, Lady Dedlock confronts her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>)'s Esther's
mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) orders Esther to never speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) again, since this
must remain a secret. Richard pursues the Jarndyce lawsuit more earnestly, aided
by a lawyer named Vholes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) no longer speaks to Mr. Jarndyce, who doesn't
want anything to do with the suit. Esther visits Guppy and instructs him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) to stop investigating
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). Tulkinghorn visits Chesney Wold and hints that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) knows
Lady Dedlock's secret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) confronts him (<font color='blue'><b>Wold</b></font>) and says she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) will leave
Chesney Wold immediately because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) secret will destroy
Rosa's marriage prospects. Tulkinghorn convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) to stay, since
fleeing will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) secret known too fast. When Tulkinghorn is
back home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) is visited by Mademoiselle Hortense, who demands he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) help
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) find a job. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) threatens to arrest her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) keeps harassing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>). Esther tells Mr. Jarndyce about Lady Dedlock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) reveals
that Boythorn was once in love with Miss Barbary, who left him (<font color='blue'><b>Boythorn</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
decided to raise Esther in secret. Mr. Jarndyce gives Esther a letter
that asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>). Esther accepts. Esther tries to convince Richard to abandon the Jarndyce
suit. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is visiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) has left the army
and devoted himself entirely to the lawsuit. Esther sees Mr. Woodcourt on
the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) asks Mr. Woodcourt to befriend Richard in London,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) agrees. In London, Woodcourt runs into Jo on the street and gives
him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) some food. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) discovers that Jo once stayed with Esther. Jo
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) that a man forced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to leave and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s now scared
of running into him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Woodcourt helps Jo find a hiding place at George's
Shooting Gallery. Jo soon dies. Lady Dedlock dismisses Rosa with no explanation in order
to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>). Tulkinghorn is enraged and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>)'ll reveal the
secret. That night, Tulkinghorn is shot through the heart. The next
day, Bucket arrests George for the murder. Ada reveals to Esther that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and Richard have been secretly married. Bucket investigates Tulkinghorn's murder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) receives
a few letters that say only <div class="bookquote">``Lady Dedlock.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) confronts Sir Leicester
and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) knows about Lady Dedlock's past. Instead of arresting
Lady Dedlock, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) arrests Mademoiselle Hortense, who killed
Tulkinghorn and tried to frame Lady Dedlock. Meanwhile, Mrs. Rouncewell, the housekeeper at Chesney Wold,
finds out that George is her (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) long-lost son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rouncewell</b></font>) begs Lady Dedlock
to do anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) can to help him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Guppy arrives and tells Lady
Dedlock that the letters were actually not destroyed. Lady Dedlock
writes a note to Sir Leicester, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) didn't murder Tulkinghorn,
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) flees. Sir Leicester collapses from a stroke. Mrs. Rouncewell
gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) Lady Dedlock's letter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) orders Bucket to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>),
saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>) forgives her (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) for everything. Bucket asks Esther to join
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guppy</b></font>), and they set out in search of Lady Dedlock in the middle of
the night. While Sir Leicester waits at home, unable to speak clearly,
Esther and Bucket search. Eventually Bucket figures out where to
find her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). They finally find Lady Dedlock at the gate of the burial
ground where Hawdon is buried. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dedlock</b></font>) is dead. Richard is sick and still obsessed with Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Ada
is pregnant and hopes the baby will distract Richard from his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) obsession
with the lawsuit. After visiting Richard one night, Woodcourt walks
Esther home and confesses he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) still loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) once did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) is engaged to Mr. Jarndyce. Smallweed finds a Jarndyce will among Krook's property
and gives it to Vholes. George moves to Chesney Wold, where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) helps tend to Sir Leicester. Esther begins to plan the wedding. Mr. Jarndyce goes to
Yorkshire on business and then sends for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) arrives,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) finds out that Mr. Jarndyce has bought a house for Woodcourt
out of gratitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) the house, which is decorated in
Esther's style, and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>)'s named the house Bleak House.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarndyce</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) loves Woodcourt and that they
should be married. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) will always be her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) guardian. Woodcourt appears,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodcourt</b></font>) and Esther reunite. The Jarndyce and Jarndyce case is finally dismissed. No
one gets any money since the inheritance had been used up to pay
the legal fees. Richard dies. Esther says she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) and Woodcourt have two daughters and that
Ada had a son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) is very happy.
