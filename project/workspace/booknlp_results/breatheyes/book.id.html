Noting sadness in her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) aunt, Sophie presents Atie with a handmade Mother's Day card she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) had been meaning to save. But Atie refuses to take it, insisting that the card belongs to Martine, her (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) sister and Sophie's absent mother. That night, at the konbit potluck dinner, Atie is forced to reveal that Martine has mailed her (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) a plane ticket and instructions to send Sophie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) mother in New York. The gossips are delighted, but Sophie is devastated. Preparations for the trip begin. Sophie and Atie make a trip to La Nouvelle Dame Marie, Haiti, to obtain the blessing of Sophie's maternal Grandmè Ifé for Sophie's voyage. That week, Atie works late to buy Sophie a new dress for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) trip. On the morning of Sophie's departure, the taxi arrives in the middle of breakfast. Arriving in Port-au-Prince, Sophie and Atie find themselves in the midst of a riot over the airport's name change. Sophie is rushed onto the plane along with a small hysterical boy whose father, a corrupt government official, has just been killed in the demonstration. Arriving in New York, Sophie is met by Martine, who looks scrawny and tired, unlike the smiling woman in Atie's photographs. Arriving home to a poor neighborhood, Martine tells Sophie that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) only chance lies in academic success. Sophie promises to work hard. That night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) wakes to find Martine the midst of a violent nightmare. Sophie wakes her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>), and Martine thanks Sophie for saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) life. The next night, Sophie and Martine go to a Haitian restaurant with Marc, an affluent Haitian immigration lawyer who has become Martine's long-term lover. Sophie realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) is a relic of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) mother's past, and is ashamed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) looks like no one in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) family. In the months before school starts, Sophie spends her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) days with Martine at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) various jobs. Late one night, as Martine is babysitting an invalid old woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) reveals to Sophie that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) own mother used to test for virginity by making sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) hymen was intact. But this testing stopped early, as Martine was raped by a masked man at sixteen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) way home from school, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) pregnant with Sophie. The rapist's unseen face is mirrored in Sophie's own. Six years have passed and Martine's work is paying off, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) nightmares continue. The Cacos have moved to a small house in a neighborhood near Marc, and Sophie is preparing to attend college. In the past six years, Sophie has done little but study, and has known no men. Now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) finds herself attracted to Joseph, the older musician next door. While Martine works night and day, Sophie and Joseph gradually become friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) is kind, articulate and respectful. Eventually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>). Coming home late the next night, Sophie is caught by a furious, frantic Martine, who takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) upstairs and promptly tests her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) virginity. In the weeks that follow, the testing continues and Sophie begins to feel depressed and isolated. Finally, in desperation, Sophie impales herself her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) mother's spice pestle, breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) hymen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) subsequently fails Martine's test, and is thrown out of the house, whereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) elopes with Joseph to Providence, R.I. Sophie arrives in La Nouvelle Dame Marie, Haiti, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) infant daughter Brigitte, not having spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) mother in two years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) finds Macoutes wandering the marketplace, a desperate Louise trying to raise money to leave Haiti, and an increasingly alcoholic Atie. Nonetheless, the women are delighted with Brigitte, whom they declare has Martine's face. The reasons for Sophie's trip gradually become evident. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) left while Joseph was on tour, driven to desperation by a hatred of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) body and a terror of sex. Though Joseph is understanding and kind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) cannot sleep with him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) without doubling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) blames her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) phobia on Martine's testing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>), and in turn on Grandmè Ifé's testing of Martine. Several days into her (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) trip, Louise arrives in tears with the news that the Macoutes have arbitrarily killed a poor coal seller, Dessalines, in the marketplace. Sophie mediates on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) mother's rape, probably due to a Macoute, and on the Haitian obsession with female purity. The next week, Martine arrives in Dame Marie, summoned by Grandmè Ifé for the purpose of reconciliation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) tells Sophie that although they started off wrong, now that Sophie is an adult, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) and Martine can begin again. The sympathy between them returns. That night, Atie and Martine reflect on the mess of their lives. Later, Grandmè Ifé, fed up with Louise's influence on Atie, finally buys her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) pig so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) will have money to leave the country. Louise leaves without telling Atie goodbye. On the plane home, the stress of being in Haiti leaves Martine physically ill. Sophie spends the night at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) mother's house, and the next morning Martine reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) is pregnant by Marc. As a result, her (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) nightmares of the rape have been getting worse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) does not know what to do. Sophie returns home to Joseph, who is furious at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) for leaving, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) very much. In that week, Sophie attends her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) sexual phobia group and meets with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) therapist, Rena, while Joseph tries to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) heal. As a gesture of goodwill, Martine invites Sophie and Joseph to spend that Saturday with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) and Marc. The day is spent eating, laughing, and singing spirituals. When Sophie, Joseph and Brigitte return home, Martine calls to tell Sophie that the baby has begun speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) in the rapist's voice, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) has decided she (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) must have an abortion. The next day, Sophie returns from therapy to an urgent message from Marc. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) finally gets through, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marc</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) that Martine has committed suicide by stabbing herself in the stomach with a rusty knife seventeen times. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) died in the ambulance after telling Marc that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) could not carry the baby. Sophie and Marc make the trip to Dame Marie for Martine's burial. During the funeral, unable to watch dirt being shoveled over her (<font color='blue'><b>Martine</b></font>) mother, Sophie runs into the cane fields, the scene of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) mother's rape, and begins violently attacking the stalks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) has finally become free.
