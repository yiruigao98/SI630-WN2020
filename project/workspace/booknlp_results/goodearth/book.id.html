rural, turn-of-the-century China. During the time in which the novel
takes place, Chinese society is showing signs of modernization while
remaining deeply connected to ancient traditions and customs. When
Wang Lung reaches a marriageable age, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) father approaches the
powerful local Hwang family to ask if they have a spare slave who
could marry his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) son. The Hwangs agree to sell Wang a 20-year-old
slave named O-lan, who becomes his (<font color='blue'><b>Wang</b></font>) wife. O-lan and Wang Lung are
pleased with each other, although they exchange few words and although
Wang is initially disappointed that O-lan does not have bound feet. Together, Wang Lung and O-lan cultivate a bountiful and
profitable harvest from their land. O-lan becomes pregnant, and
Wang Lung is overjoyed when O-lan's first child is a son. Meanwhile,
the powerful Hwang family lives decadently--the husband is obsessed with
women, and the wife is an opium addict. Because of their costly habits,
the Hwangs fall on hard times, and Wang Lung is able to purchase
a piece of their fertile rice land. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) enjoys another profitable
harvest, and O-lan gives birth to another son. Wang Lung's new wealth
catches the attention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) greedy, lazy uncle. Custom dictates
that Wang Lung must show the utmost respect to members of the older
generation, especially relatives, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) is forced to loan his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) uncle
money despite knowing that the money will be wasted on drinking
and gambling. The Hwang family's finances continue to falter, and
the Hwangs sell another tract of land to Wang Lung. After O-lan gives birth to a daughter, a terrible famine
settles on the land. In the midst of this crisis, O-lan gives birth
to another daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) strangles the second girl because there
is not enough food to feed the baby and the rest of the family.
Wang Lung is forced to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) family to a southern city for the
winter. There, O-lan and the children beg while Wang Lung earns
money by transporting people in a rented rickshaw. They earn just
enough money to eat. Wang Lung begins to despair of ever making
enough money to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) land. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) and O-lan briefly consider
selling their surviving daughter as a slave. Eventually, a group
of poor and desperate people ransacks a rich man's home, and Wang
Lung and O-lan join them. Wang Lung steals a pile of gold coins.
With this new wealth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) moves the family back home and purchases
a new ox and some seeds. O-lan had stolen some jewels during the
looting. Wang Lung allows her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to keep two small pearls, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) takes
the rest and hurries to buy three hundred acres of Old Master Hwang's
land. O-lan gives birth to twins shortly thereafter. The couple
realizes that their oldest daughter is severely retarded, but Wang
Lung loves the child dearly. Wang Lung hires laborers to plant and harvest his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) land.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) enjoys several years of profitable harvests and becomes a rich
man. When a flood forces him (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) to be idle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) begins to feel restless
and bored. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) finds fault with O-lan's appearance and cruelly criticizes her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
for having big feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) becomes obsessed with Lotus, a beautiful,
delicate prostitute with bound feet. Eventually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) purchases Lotus
to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) concubine. When O-lan becomes terminally ill, Wang Lung
regrets his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) cruel words and comes to appreciate everything his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) wife
has done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>). Meanwhile, to lessen the demands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) uncle
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) uncle's wife, who have moved their family into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) house
and continued to exploit his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) wealth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) tricks them into becoming
opium addicts. Eventually, Wang Lung rents the Hwangs' house and
moves into it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) family, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) own house to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) uncle's
family. After O-lan's death, Wang Lung's sons begin to rebel
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) plans for their life. They do not want to work as farmers
and do not have his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) devotion to the land. Furthermore, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) first
and second sons often argue over money, and their wives develop
an intense animosity toward one another. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) old age, Wang Lung
takes a young slave, Pear Blossom, as a concubine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) promises
to care for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) retarded daughter after his (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) death. In time, Wang
Lung is surrounded by grandchildren, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lung</b></font>) is also surrounded by
petty family disagreements. By the end of the novel, despite Wang's
passionate dissent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wang</b></font>) sons plan to sell the family land and divide
the money among themselves, signaling their final break with the
land that made them wealthy.
