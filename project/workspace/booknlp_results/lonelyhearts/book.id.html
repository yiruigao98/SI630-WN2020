(<font color='red'><b>readers</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>columnist</b></font>) editor is a cynical older man named Shrike who mockingly compares Miss Lonelyhearts to Jesus Christ. Miss Lonelyhearts decides he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) no longer finds the thirty letters he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) receives each day amusing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) reads through three letters that speak of unendurable emotional pain. Miss Lonelyhearts thinks that Christ is the answer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) knows that Shrike would mock him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) discussed Christ. Shrike says that art is the answer, as art is distilled from suffering. Miss Lonelyhearts has a few drinks at a speakeasy, where Shrike tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) to stop brooding and instead embrace more indulgent values. Miss Lonelyhearts returns home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) one-room apartment, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) has nailed a figure of Christ to the wall. Miss Lonelyhearts dreams about a time in college when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) and two friends bought a young lamb to roast. Miss Lonelyhearts wants to sacrifice the lamb to God first. In a meadow, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) chants <div class="bookquote">``Christ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and tries to kill the lamb, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) knife blows are inaccurate, and the wounded lamb escapes. Later, Miss Lonelyhearts pleads with his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) friends to put the lamb out of its misery, but they stay put. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) finds the lamb himself, crushes its head with a stone, and leaves its carcass to the flies. Miss Lonelyhearts has an obsession with keeping inanimate objects in order. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) thinks of Betty, who always provided order. Confused and irritated when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) goes to Betty's apartment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) tongue turns into a <div class="bookquote">``fat thumb''  (<font color='red'><b>Betty</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) has difficulty speaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) thinks about how Betty had accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) marriage proposition two months earlier, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had guiltlessly avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) thereafter. Miss Lonelyhearts says he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) has a Christ complex and loves humanity. Betty says she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) admits he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) alone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) has made her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) feel bad. Miss Lonelyhearts goes to the speakeasy and meets some friends. They complain about female writers and tell stories of literary women who are put in their place by rape. Miss Lonelyhearts thinks his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) friends have lost their way, but they criticize his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) approach to religion as too literary and personal. Miss Lonelyhearts collides with a man, accidentally spilling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drink, and gets punched in the mouth. Later, Miss Lonelyhearts and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend Ned Gates leave the speakeasy and head through the snow to the park. They drag an old man from a toilet, ridiculing and interrogating him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as Miss Lonelyhearts pretends to be a psychologist. The old man cries and Miss Lonelyhearts twists his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, feeling like he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is twisting the arms of all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) readers. Miss Lonelyhearts gets hit from behind with a chair. Hung over, Miss Lonelyhearts wakes up and tries various methods to warm his (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) heart--hot water, whisky, coffee, and exercise--before thinking of sex. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) only option for such release besides Betty is Mary Shrike. Mary will kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hates Shrike, but will not sleep with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>). Miss Lonelyhearts goes to Mary's place, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) is not surprised to find Shrike at the door. The men bicker about Mary, and Shrike says his (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) wife has selfishly fought to remain a virgin and claims that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) raped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Mary comes into the room and tells Miss Lonelyhearts to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) in the bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) does, and Shrike leaves the apartment. Miss Lonelyhearts and Mary go to a Spanish restaurant, but the dreamy atmosphere depresses him (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) asks Mary to sleep with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) refuses. At the door to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) apartment, they kiss, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is afraid Shrike will hear them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says if Shrike is not inside she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) in. Miss Lonelyhearts hides as Shrike comes to the door. At work, Miss Lonelyhearts receives a letter from a woman named Fay Doyle who says she (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) is unhappily married to a <div class="bookquote">``cripple.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) has seen Miss Lonelyhearts in the speakeasy, wants his (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) advice about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) married life, and has included her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) phone number in the letter. Miss Lonelyhearts calls Mrs. Doyle from a phone booth and meets her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) in the park. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) takes the large, brutish woman to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) apartment, where they have sex. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) older, crippled husband, and says that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) daughter, Lucy, is not his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Fay recounts the story of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) came to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) husband, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) unhappiness with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>), and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) regret. Miss Lonelyhearts assures her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) husband must love both her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) and Lucy. After Mrs. Doyle leaves, Miss Lonelyhearts gets sick. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) falls asleep but then wakes up as Betty enters his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) room with nourishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) apologizes for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) actions the other day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) blames his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) job and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to quit. Miss Lonelyhearts says that quitting would make no difference, and explains how his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) job has made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) suffer. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sees that Betty does not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) speaks of the benefits of country living until Shrike comes in, at which time she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) leaves. Shrike describes various lifestyle choices that might potentially satisfy Miss Lonelyhearts, but rejects all of them as impossible on various grounds. Shrike mockingly maintains that only a life of God and worship can provide hope. Betty continues visiting Miss Lonelyhearts. When spring comes she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) takes him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) aunt's farm in Connecticut. They install themselves in the musty farm, cleaning house, cooking dinner, and going down to the lake. Miss Lonelyhearts tries to seduce Betty, but stops when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) is a virgin. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) meets an anti-Semitic gas station attendant and finds the forest's undergrowth depressing. When Betty hangs up wet clothes in the nude, Miss Lonelyhearts kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) and they tumble into the grass. Miss Lonelyhearts and Betty return to New York a few days later. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is not cured, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has not been able to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) readers' letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) watches the crowds in the streets, thinking of how their dreams have been made <div class="bookquote">``puerile''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>by the media. Miss Lonelyhearts realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), too, dreams--about Christ--but fails at it because of lack of humility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) vows to be humble. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) office, Miss Lonelyhearts reads a letter from a woman who calls herself <div class="bookquote">``Broad Shoulders''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>and tells a long story about debt and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) abusive husband. At the speakeasy, a man named Peter Doyle, whose foot is crippled, introduces himself to Miss Lonelyhearts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) says that Mrs. Doyle told him (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) should invite Miss Lonelyhearts to dinner if he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) ran into him (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>). Miss Lonelyhearts accepts. Later, Doyle hands Miss Lonelyhearts a letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) has written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>). In the letter Doyle tells Miss Lonelyhearts about his (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) disability and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) job and repeatedly asks what the point of it all is. After Miss Lonelyhearts finishes it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) accidentally touches Doyle's hand under the table, quickly retracts his (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) own hand embarrassedly, but then clasps Doyle's hand firmly. Miss Lonelyhearts and Doyle leave the speakeasy, drunk, and go to Doyle's house. Doyle curses his (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) wife, who flirts with Miss Lonelyhearts. When Doyle protests, Fay hits him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) with a newspaper. The two men hold hands again, prompting Fay to call them <div class="bookquote">``fairies.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fay</b></font>)</div>Miss Lonelyhearts urges Fay to promote her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) husband's strength, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) knows that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) reluctance to speak about God reduces his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) advice to the meaningless level of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) columns. Doyle tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) grudgingly forgives him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) and sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) out for liquor. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) leaves, Fay resumes trying to seduce Miss Lonelyhearts. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) gets more forceful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) hits her (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) repeatedly and then leaves. Miss Lonelyhearts spends three days in bed. Shrike and four others come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) door. Shrike says they want to play a game involving Miss Lonelyhearts's letters. They take a cab to a party at Shrike's apartment. Betty is there as well. Shrike introduces Miss Lonelyhearts to the guests as a moral and spiritual crusader. He (<font color='blue'><b>crusader</b></font>) directs each of the guests to answer one letter addressed to Miss Lonelyhearts, and says that Miss Lonelyhearts will analyze their responses and provide guidance. Shrike hands out the letters, synopsizing them first. He (<font color='blue'><b>crusader</b></font>) hands Miss Lonelyhearts one letter, but Miss Lonelyhearts drops it without reading it. Betty leaves, and Miss Lonelyhearts follows her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>). Shrike reads the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>crusader</b></font>) gave Miss Lonelyhearts, which is from Peter Doyle, and denounces Miss Lonelyhearts for allegedly attempting to rape Fay. Shrike says his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) faith in <div class="bookquote">``the master''  (<font color='red'><b>Shrike</b></font>)</div>is unshaken, however. Miss Lonelyhearts catches Betty, who is wearing a light blue party dress, outside Shrike's apartment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) reluctantly accepts his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) invitation to a soda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) lies and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) has quit his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) job and will try to get an advertising job. After they flirt and laugh, Betty cries, though what Miss Lonelyhearts calls the <div class="bookquote">``rock''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lonelyhearts</b></font>)</div>in him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) is unmoved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) is pregnant. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) wants an abortion, Miss Lonelyhearts convinces her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>). They make plans about their life together as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) returns her (<font color='blue'><b>Lonelyhearts</b></font>) home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) remains unfeeling. Miss Lonelyhearts gladly accepts a fever that comes after a long night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) shouts out Christ's name. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) identifies his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) heart and mind with God. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) plans his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) life and job anew and offers drafts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) column to God, who approves of everything. Miss Lonelyhearts answers the doorbell and sees Doyle walking up the stairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) thinks of it as a chance to embrace and heal the cripple, and runs down to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>). Doyle carries something inside a newspaper, and reaches inside when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) sees Miss Lonelyhearts. Doyle tries to flee, but Miss Lonelyhearts catches him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>). Betty enters the apartment, starts up the stairs, and tells them to stop. Doyle panics and tries to get rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) package, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) hand out. The gun inside explodes and Miss Lonelyhearts falls, rolling with Doyle down the stairs.
