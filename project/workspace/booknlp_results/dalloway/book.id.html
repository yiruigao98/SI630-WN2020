day from morning to night in one woman's life. Clarissa Dalloway,
an upper-class housewife, walks through her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) London neighborhood
to prepare for the party she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) will host that evening. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) returns
from flower shopping, an old suitor and friend, Peter Walsh, drops
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) house unexpectedly. The two have always judged each other
harshly, and their meeting in the present intertwines with their
thoughts of the past. Years earlier, Clarissa refused Peter's marriage
proposal, and Peter has never quite gotten over it. Peter asks Clarissa
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) is happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) husband, Richard, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) can answer,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) daughter, Elizabeth, enters the room. Peter leaves and goes
to Regent's Park. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thinks about Clarissa's refusal, which still
obsesses him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). The point of view then shifts to Septimus, a veteran of
World War I who was injured in trench warfare and now suffers from
shell shock. Septimus and his (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) Italian wife, Lucrezia, pass time
in Regent's Park. They are waiting for Septimus's appointment with
Sir William Bradshaw, a celebrated psychiatrist. Before the war,
Septimus was a budding young poet and lover of Shakespeare; when
the war broke out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) enlisted immediately for romantic patriotic
reasons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) became numb to the horrors of war and its aftermath:
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) friend Evans died, he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) felt little sadness. Now Septimus
sees nothing of worth in the England he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) fought for, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) has lost
the desire to preserve either his (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) society or himself. Suicidal,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) believes his (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) lack of feeling is a crime. Clearly Septimus's experiences
in the war have permanently scarred him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) has serious mental
problems. However, Sir William does not listen to what Septimus
says and diagnoses <div class="bookquote">``a lack of proportion.''  (<font color='red'><b>Septimus</b></font>)</div>Sir William plans to
separate Septimus from Lucrezia and send him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to a mental institution
in the country. Richard Dalloway eats lunch with Hugh Whitbread and Lady Bruton,
members of high society. The men help Lady Bruton write a letter
to the Times, London's largest newspaper. After
lunch, Richard returns home to Clarissa with a large bunch of roses.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) intends to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) but finds that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) cannot,
because it has been so long since he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) last said it. Clarissa considers
the void that exists between people, even between husband and wife.
Even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) values the privacy she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) is able to maintain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>)
marriage, considering it vital to the success of the relationship,
at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) finds slightly disturbing the fact that Richard
doesn't know everything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>). Clarissa sees off Elizabeth and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) history teacher, Miss Kilman, who are going shopping. The two
older women despise one another passionately, each believing the
other to be an oppressive force over Elizabeth. Meanwhile, Septimus
and Lucrezia are in their apartment, enjoying a moment of happiness together
before the men come to take Septimus to the asylum. One of Septimus's
doctors, Dr. Holmes, arrives, and Septimus fears the doctor will
destroy his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) soul. In order to avoid this fate, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) jumps from a window
to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) death. Peter hears the ambulance go by to pick up Septimus's
body and marvels ironically at the level of London's civilization.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) goes to Clarissa's party, where most of the novel's major characters
are assembled. Clarissa works hard to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) party a success but
feels dissatisfied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) own role and acutely conscious of Peter's
critical eye. All the partygoers, but especially Peter and Sally
Seton, have, to some degree, failed to accomplish the dreams of
their youth. Though the social order is undoubtedly changing, Elizabeth
and the members of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) generation will probably repeat the errors
of Clarissa's generation. Sir William Bradshaw arrives late, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bradshaw</b></font>) wife explains that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bradshaw</b></font>) patients, the young veteran -LRB-Septimus-RRB-,
has committed suicide. Clarissa retreats to the privacy of a small
room to consider Septimus's death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) understands that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradshaw</b></font>) was overwhelmed
by life and that men like Sir William make life intolerable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>)
identifies with Septimus, admiring him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for having taken the plunge
and for not compromising his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) feels, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) comfortable
position as a society hostess, responsible for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) death. The party
nears its close as guests begin to leave. Clarissa enters the room,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) presence fills Peter with a great excitement.
