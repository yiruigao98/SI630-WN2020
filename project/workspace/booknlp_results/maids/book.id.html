Claire makes herself up at the dressing table and calls in Solange to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) dress and accessories. She (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) accuses Solange of letting the milkman -LRB-Mario-RRB- seduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>), and insults her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) appearance and manners. Claire defends herself for having <div class="bookquote">``denounced''  (<font color='red'><b>Claire</b></font>)</div>Monsieur to the police in a letter that sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Mario</b></font>) to prison. Claire submits to a red dress and says Solange loathes her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>). Claire kicks Solange in the temple. When Solange's and Claire's fingers accidentally touch, Claire says she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) cannot stand touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>). Solange reprimands her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) and speaks of the importance of boundaries and frontiers between them. Solange asks if Claire is ready, and then declares her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) hatred for Claire and insults her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) aristocratic appearance and behavior. Solange shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) in the mirror the two maids. She (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) to despise them, then says <div class="bookquote">``We're merged in our hatred of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Claire tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) to get out, and Solange says she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) will return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) dirty kitchen, but first she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) will <div class="bookquote">``finish the job.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Claire urges Solange to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) out of the dress, as Madame will be back. Solange blames Claire for never being ready and allowing Solange to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) off. Solange says Claire started their fighting by bringing up Mario and mingling her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) insults with details from their private lives. Claire says she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) envies Solange for having seen Madame's crestfallen face when she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) husband's arrest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) takes credit, however, for having written the anonymous letter that sent him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to prison. Solange says nobody loves them, but Claire insists that their kind Madame does. Claire tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) to calm down and says she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) has some information on Solange that she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) would not want revealed. Claire brings up the fantastical stories she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) has written that Solange used as escapism, such as the one in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) vicariously fled France with her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) thieving husband. Claire says the reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) hates Solange is because in her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) attempt to kill Madame, she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) was aiming for Claire. Claire answers the phone and learns from Monsieur that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has been freed from prison on bail. Solange tries to calm down Claire. Claire says it is her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) turn to dominate Solange, and gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) a number of household orders. Solange fantasizes about how they will kill Madame. The doorbell rings. Claire and Solange scramble to prepare for Madame's entrance. Solange says they need to put ten pills in her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) tea, and Claire agrees to do it. They both leave the bedroom, and Solange returns with Madame. Madame accuses Solange of pampering her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) like an invalid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) apologizes, then calls herself old, and says she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) is thinking of going into mourning. Solange promises never to abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>). Madame says she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) is through with her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) excessive life. Claire enters with the tea. Madame says the sisters will inherit her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) lavish lifestyle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) gives Claire the red dress Claire previously wore, and gives Solange a fur cape. Madame spots the telephone off the hook. Claire says it was Monsieur. After Madame presses, Solange says they wanted to keep it as a surprise--Monsieur is free and waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) at a bar. In a flurry, Madame orders Solange to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) a taxi and Claire to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) furs ready. Madame is piqued by the mystery of the letters, Solange's delay, and the sisters' not telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) Monsieur had called. Claire insists that Madame drink the tea, but Solange runs in, pushes Claire aside, and says the taxi is finally ready. Solange tries to stir her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) sister into a rage, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) that Madame and Monsieur will probably find out about the letters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) loathes Madame and criticizes her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) gifts, including the fur, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) took back. Claire angrily asks if Solange wants to <div class="bookquote">``make a scene.''  (<font color='red'><b>Solange</b></font>)</div>Solange praises Claire's beauty, but Claire tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) to start with the insults. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is unable to do it, so Claire takes the reins and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) despises servants. Solange takes over and, with a riding whip, orders Claire down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) knees. Claire reluctantly does so, and Solange slanders her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) more, strikes her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>), and commands her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) to lie down. Solange tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) to go into the kitchen, and Claire screams for help. Solange tells Claire that she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) performed abortions on herself to keep Claire alive. Claire runs around the room, and Solange chases her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>), but when Claire gags and says she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) feels ill, Solange comforts her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) and walks her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) off to the kitchen, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) has ways of <div class="bookquote">``putting an end to all suffering.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Solange returns from the kitchen, wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) black dress. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) ensuing monologue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) addresses imaginary characters on stage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) celebrates having strangled Madame with the dish-gloves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) imitates Madame's voice and complains about having to wear mourning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) maid. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) own voice, Solange says Madame should not pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>)'s her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) equal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) addresses a police inspector, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) Monsieur used to obey their orders when they threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) has been a good servant, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) has strangled her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) sister. Solange smokes a cigarette, coughs, and goes out on to the balcony, her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) back to the audience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) imagines the hangman taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) sees herself being led by all the maids in the neighborhood for Claire's funeral procession. Claire, visible only to the audience, leans against the kitchen door and listens to her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) sister. Returning to the room, Solange cries for poor Claire. Claire enters the room, wearing the white dress. Claire says for <div class="bookquote">``Claire''  (<font color='red'><b>Claire</b></font>)</div>to pour her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) a cup of tea. Solange protests and tiredly sits down, but Claire insists. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) tells <div class="bookquote">``Claire''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>to stand up straight and to <div class="bookquote">``represent''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) lifts Solange up and makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) repeat after her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Madame must have her (<font color='blue'><b>Solange</b></font>) tea''  (<font color='red'><b>Solange</b></font>)</div>and other corresponding sentences. Solange brings in the tea and Claire drinks it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) comments on the end of the theatrical production--the orchestra plays, the attendant raises the red velvet curtain, and Madame descends the stairs and gets into her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) car with Monsieur. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is dead, but rings the bell, enters the apartment, and finds Madame dead. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) two maids are alive, however, risen up from Madame's form, now free. Solange proclaims themselves, <div class="bookquote">``beautiful, joyous, drunk, and free!''
