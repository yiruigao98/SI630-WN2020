his grandmother lies ill in bed, four-year-old Richard Wright becomes
bored and begins playing with fire near the curtains, leading to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wright</b></font>)
accidentally burning down the family home in Natchez, Mississippi.
In fear, Richard hides under the burning house. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) father, Nathan,
retrieves him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hiding place. Then, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother, Ella, beats
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so severely that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loses consciousness and falls ill. Nathan abandons the family to live with another woman
while Richard and his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) brother, Alan, are still very young. Without Nathan's
financial support, the Wrights fall into poverty and perpetual hunger.
Richard closely associates his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) family's hardship--and particularly
their hunger--with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) father and therefore grows bitter toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). For the next few years, Ella struggles to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Ella</b></font>) children
in Memphis, Tennessee. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ella</b></font>) long hours of work leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ella</b></font>) little time
to supervise Richard and his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) brother. Not surprisingly, Richard
gets into all sorts of trouble, spying on people in outhouses and
becoming a regular at the local saloon--and an alcoholic--by the age
of six. Ella's worsening health prevents her (<font color='blue'><b>Ella</b></font>) from raising two children by
herself and often leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Ella</b></font>) unable to work. During these times, Richard
does whatever odd jobs a child can do to bring in some money for
the family. School is hardly an option for him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). At one point, the
family's troubles are so severe that Ella must place her (<font color='blue'><b>Ella</b></font>) children
in an orphanage for a few weeks. Life improves when Ella moves to Elaine, Arkansas, to
live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ella</b></font>) sister, Maggie, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ella</b></font>) sister's husband, Hoskins.
Hoskins runs a successful saloon, so there is always plenty of food
to eat, a condition that Richard greatly appreciates but to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) cannot accustom himself. Soon, however, white jealousy of Hoskins's
business success reaches a peak, as local white men kill Hoskins
and threaten the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hoskins</b></font>) family. Ella and Maggie flee with the
two boys to West Helena, Arkansas. There, the two sisters' combined
wages make life easier than it had been in Memphis. After only a
short time, however, Maggie flees to Detroit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lover, Professor
Matthews, leaving Ella the sole support of the family. Hard economic
times return. Times become even harder when a paralytic stroke severely
incapacitates Ella. Richard's grandmother brings Ella, Richard,
and Alan to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ella</b></font>) home in Jackson, Mississippi. Ella's numerous siblings convene
in Jackson to decide how to care for their ailing sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ella</b></font>)
two boys. The aunts and uncles decide that Alan, Richard's brother,
will live with Maggie in Detroit. Ella will remain at home in Jackson.
Richard, given the freedom to choose which aunt or uncle to live
with, decides to take up residence with Uncle Clark, as Clark lives
in Greenwood, Mississippi, not far from Jackson. Soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) arrives
at Clark's house, Richard learns from a neighbor that a young boy
had died years ago in the same bedroom Richard now occupies. Too
terrified to sleep, Richard successfully pleads to be returned to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) grandmother's home. Back at Granny's, Richard once again faces the familiar
problem of hunger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) also faces a new problem: Granny's incredibly
strict religious regimen. Granny, a Seventh-Day Adventist, sees
her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) strong-willed, dreamy, and bookish grandson as terribly sinful,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) struggles mightily to reform him (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>). Another of Richard's aunts, Addie,
soon joins the struggle against Richard's defiance. Richard's obsession
with reading and his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) lack of interest in religion make his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) home
life an endless conflict. Granny forces him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) to attend the religious
school where Aunt Addie teaches. One day in class, Aunt Addie beats Richard for eating
walnuts, though it was actually the student sitting in front of
Richard who had been eating the nuts, not Richard. When Addie tries
to beat Richard again after school that day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) fends her (<font color='blue'><b>Addie</b></font>) off with
a knife. Similar scenes recur with frustrating frequency over the
following months and years. One time, Richard dodges one of Granny's
backhand slaps, causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) balance and injure herself
in a fall off the porch. Addie tries to beat Richard for this incident,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) again fends her (<font color='blue'><b>Addie</b></font>) off with a knife. Later, another of Richard's
uncles, Tom, comes to live with the family. One morning, Tom asks
Richard what time it is and thinks Richard responds in a sassy manner.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) tries to beat Richard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) supposed insolence, but the boy
fends him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) off with razor blades. Meanwhile, Richard picks his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) way through school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) delights in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) studies--particularly reading and writing--despite a home climate
hostile to such pursuits. To the bafflement and scorn of everyone,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) writes and publishes in a local black newspaper a story titled
<div class="bookquote">``The Voodoo of Hell's Half-Acre.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) graduates from the ninth grade
as valedictorian, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) own speech despite the insistence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) principal, friends, and family that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) give a school-sanctioned
speech to appease the white audience. As Richard enters the adult working world in Jackson,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) suffers many frightening, often violent encounters with racism.
In the most demoralizing of these encounters, two white Southerners,
Pease and Reynolds, run Richard off his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) job at an optical shop,
claiming that such skilled work is not meant for blacks. Richard
is upset because the white Northerner who runs the company, Mr.
Crane, has hired Richard specifically for the purpose of teaching
a black man the optical trade, but then does little to actually
help defend Richard against his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) racist employees. As his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) despair grows, Richard resolves to leave for the
North as soon as possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) becomes willing to steal in order
to raise the cash necessary for the trip. After swindling his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) boss
at a movie theater, selling stolen fruit preserves, and pawning
a stolen gun, Richard moves to Memphis, where the atmosphere is
safer and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) can make his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) final preparations to move to Chicago. In Memphis, Richard has the seeming good fortune of finding
a kind, generous landlady, Mrs. Moss, who determines that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) must marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>) daughter, Bess. Richard does not take to Bess, so his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) living situation
is awkward until Mrs. Moss comes to terms with the fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>Moss</b></font>)
daughter will never be Richard's wife. Richard takes a job at another
optical shop, where Olin, a seemingly benevolent white coworker,
plays mind games with Richard and Harrison, another young black
worker, in an attempt to get them to kill each other. These strategies
culminate in a grotesque boxing match between Richard and Harrison. Another white coworker in the optical shop, Falk, is genuinely benevolent
and lets Richard use his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) library card to check out books that otherwise
would be unavailable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). Richard begins reading obsessively
and grows more determined to write. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mother, brother, and Maggie
soon join him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in Memphis. They all decide that Richard and Maggie
will go to Chicago immediately and that the other two will follow
in a few months. In Chicago, Richard continues to struggle with racism,
segregation, poverty, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) own need to cut corners and lie
to protect himself and get ahead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) suppresses his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) own morals,
forcing himself to work at a corrupt insurance agency that takes
advantage of poor blacks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) also works in a café and for a couple
of well-meaning Jewish storeowners, the Hoffmans, in a whites-only
neighborhood. Irresponsibly, Richard soon quits to try to get a
job in the post office. As the Great Depression forces him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and millions of others
out of work, Richard begins to find Communism appealing, especially
its emphasis on protecting the oppressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) becomes a Communist Party
member because he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) thinks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) can help the Party cause with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
writing, finding the language that can promote the Party's cause
to common people. Meanwhile, Richard works various jobs through federal
relief programs. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) begins writing for leftist publications,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) takes positions with federal theater companies and with the Federal
Writers' Project. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mounting dismay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) finds that, like any
other group, the Communist Party is beset with human fears and foibles that
constantly frustrate its own ends. Richard's desire to write biographical
sketches of Communists and his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) tendency to criticize Party pronouncements
earn him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) distrust, along with the titles <div class="bookquote">``intellectual''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Trotskyite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>After a great deal of political strife and slander that culminates
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) being physically assaulted during a May Day parade, Richard
leaves the Party. Unfazed by the failure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) high hopes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) remains
determined to make writing his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) link to the world.
