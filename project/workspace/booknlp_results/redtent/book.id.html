introducing herself and explaining that she is reciting the memories
of her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) life and her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) mothers' lives--because without a daughter to
tell the story, a woman's history does not live on. Dinah focuses
initially on the stories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mothers, the four wives of Jacob--Leah,
Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah--and how they come to be married to the
same man. Jacob is threatened with death by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) twin brother, Esau,
in their home of Canaan and goes to Haran to seek out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) uncle
Laban and marry one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) daughters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) meets Rachel and immediately
loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) is uncommonly beautiful. Leah, who is older,
begins to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>). On Rachel and Jacob's wedding day, Zilpah convinces
Rachel -LRB-who is afraid of the wedding night-RRB- to let Leah wear the
bridal veil and marry Jacob. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) does, and Leah and Jacob spend
a blissful honeymoon week together. Then Rachel realizes she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) has
been tricked and marries Jacob herself several months later. By
then, Leah is pregnant. Laban offers his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) two illegitimate daughters,
Zilpah and Bilhah, as part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) other daughters' dowries to serve
as Jacob's concubines. One by one, they all bear sons--Leah bears
six sons, and Zilpah and Bilhah bear two each--except Rachel, who
miscarries for years and eventually becomes a midwife. At last,
Leah bears the only daughter, Dinah. Shortly thereafter, Rachel
gives birth to two healthy sons, Benjamin and Joseph. Dinah recounts her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) childhood growing up as the only girl
among eleven brothers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) spends most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) time at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mothers'
knees, following them as they cook and run the family's camp. While Dinah
plays most often with Joseph, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is adored by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mothers and can
frequently be found in one of their tents having her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hair braided.
Because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) special status as the only female child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is allowed
to enter the red tent each month with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mothers as they begin
their menstrual cycles and celebrate the new moon. There Dinah learns
to sing the songs of women, eats their special foods, and hears
the stories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) grandmother and the goddesses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) people.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is content to be wherever her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mothers are. After many years on Laban's lands, Jacob decides to return
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) family to the land of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) own people. They pack up their
entire camp, and Jacob bargains with Laban for the flocks and possessions he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
sees as rightfully his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>), having been overseer of Laban's flocks for many
years. Rachel steals Laban's household gods -LRB-which are icons or
figurines-RRB-, as they are hers by birthright -LRB-since she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) is the being youngest
daughter-RRB-. They set off for Canaan, and Dinah is awestruck by the
excitement of travel: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) sees slaves, jugglers, and strange animals.
When they finally meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) uncle Esau and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esau</b></font>) family, the reunion
is a happy one. Dinah meets her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cousin Tabea, who is the first girl
friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) makes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own age. Esau offers to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Esau</b></font>) lands
with Jacob, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) refuses, and the family moves on to find space
enough to support Jacob's many sons. They make camp at last, and
some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) sons take wives. Several years later, Jacob moves the family again, to
just outside the city of Shechem. Dinah gets her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) first period and
is received with ceremony inside the red tent by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mothers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
begins traveling with Rachel as a midwife's apprentice and one day
is called into Shechem to deliver the son of the king's concubine.
There, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) meets Shalem, the prince, and falls instantly in love.
The queen takes a liking to Dinah and requests her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) presence again
several weeks later, scheming to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) together with the prince.
They end up in bed together, and Shalem calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) wife. The
king goes to Jacob to offer a handsome bride-price but is refused.
Jacob's sons request that the entire city of Shechem be circumcised.
The king agrees, and circumcisions are performed on all the men
of Shechem. Several days later, two of Dinah's brothers, Simon and
Levi, slaughter all of these men in their sleep and carry Dinah
back home. Dinah curses her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) father and brothers and leaves Jacob's
camp for the last time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) then flees to Egypt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mother-in-law,
Re-nefer. In Egypt, Dinah gives birth to a son, Re-mose, who, against Dinah's
will, is brought up as Re-nefer's son. Dinah lives in the gardens
of Re-nefer's brother's home for many years, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) son grow
up and leave for school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) becomes good friends with the midwife
Meryt and begins to practice midwifery again. One day at the market,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) meets Benia, a master carpenter, and feels an instant attraction
to him (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>). Several months later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and Meryt move to the Valley of
the Kings to live with Meryt's son, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is reunited with Benia.
They marry, and Dinah becomes a renowned midwife in the town. Years
later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is called by a messenger -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) son, Re-mose, who has become
a scribe-RRB- to deliver the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) master, the vizier, who turns
out to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) brother Joseph. The brother and sister are reunited,
but when Re-mose learns the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father's murder, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) tries
to kill his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) uncle Joseph. Dinah convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to go away for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
own safety and never sees him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) again. One day, Joseph calls on Dinah and asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) to accompany
him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) to bid their dying father farewell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and Benia go, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
learns that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) father no longer remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) does not see
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) talks to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) nieces and learns that the story of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) tragedy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) name is very much alive in the family history,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is satisfied. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) brother Judah speaks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) and gives
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) a token left to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) by Leah: Rachel's ring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) returns home,
having accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) past and feeling satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) present.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) spends the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) days happy in the company of Benia and
Meryt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) dreams of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mothers and finds peace in the dream. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)
dies content.
