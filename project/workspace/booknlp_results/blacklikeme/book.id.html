Deeply committed to the cause of racial justice and frustrated by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inability as a white man to understand the black experience, Griffin decides to take a radical step: he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) decides to undergo medical treatment to change the color of his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) skin and temporarily become a black man. After securing the support of his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) wife and of George Levitan, the editor of a black-oriented magazine called Sepia which will fund Griffin's experience in return for an article about it, Griffin sets out for New Orleans to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) life as a black man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) finds a contact in the black community, a soft-spoken, articulate shoe-shiner named Sterling Williams, and begins a dermatological regimen of exposure to ultraviolet light, oral medication, and skin dyes. Eventually, Griffin looks in the mirror and sees a black man looking back. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) briefly panics, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) identity, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sets out to explore the black community. Griffin expects to find prejudice, oppression, and hardship, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) is shocked at the extent of it: everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) goes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) experiences difficulties and insults. The word <div class="bookquote">``nigger''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>seems to echo from every street corner. It is impossible to find a job, or even a restroom that blacks are allowed to use. Clerks refuse to cash his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) checks, and a white bully nearly attacks him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) chases the man away. After several traumatic days in New Orleans, Griffin decides to travel into the Deep South of Mississippi and Alabama, which are reputed to be even worse for blacks. -LRB-In Mississippi, a grand jury has just refused to indict a lynch mob that murdered a black man before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could stand trial.-RRB- In Mississippi, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is disheartened and exhausted, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) calls a white friend named P.D. East, a newspaperman who is ferociously opposed to racism. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spends a day with East, during which time they discuss the way racial prejudice has been incorporated into the South's legal code by bigoted writers and politicians. Eventually, a rejuvenated Griffin leaves for a long hitchhiking trip throughout Alabama and Mississippi. In general, Griffin finds that conditions for blacks are appalling, and that black communities seem run-down and defeated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) even notices a look of defeat and hopelessness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) own face, after only a few weeks as a black man. In Montgomery, however, the black community is charged with determination and energy by the example of one of its leaders, a preacher named Marin Luther King, Jr.. Blacks in Montgomery have begun practicing passive resistance, a nonviolent form of refusing to comply with racist laws and rules. Griffin, again depressed and weary of life as a black man, briefly stops taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) medication and lightens his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) skin back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) normal color. He (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) begins alternating back and forth between races, visiting a place first as a black man and then as a white man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) notices immediately that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a white man, whites treat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with respect and blacks treat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with suspicious fear; when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a black man, blacks treat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with generosity and warmth, while whites treat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with hostility and contempt. Griffin concludes that the races do not understand one another at all, and that a tolerant dialogue is needed to bridge the terrible gap separating them. In Atlanta, Griffin conducts a long series of interviews with black leaders before returning to New Orleans to make a photographic record of his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) time there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) then goes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) medication entirely, permanently returning his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) skin color to white. He (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) returns home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) family and writes his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) article, which is published in March 1960. After the article appears, Griffin is called on to do interviews with prominent television shows and newsmagazines. The story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) amazing experience quickly spreads around the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) receives a flood of congratulatory mail. In Mansfield, however, the prevalent attitude is that of racism, and Griffin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) family become the subject of hateful reprisals. An effigy of Griffin, painted half white and half black, is burned on Main Street; a cross is burned in a Negro schoolyard; threats are made against Griffin, including one to castrate him (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>). By August, things are so bad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) has decided to move his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) family to Mexico. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) goes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) has a talk with a little black boy, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) explains that racism is a result of social conditioning, not any inherent quality within blacks or whites. He (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) issues a plea for tolerance and understanding between the races, fearing that, if the current conflict is sustained, it will explode in an outbreak of terrible violence.
