She begins a strange correspondence course in philosophy. Every day, a letter comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) mailbox that contains a few questions and then later in the day a package comes with some typed pages describing the ideas of a philosopher who dealt with the issues raised by the questions. Although at first she (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) does not know, later on Sophie learns that Alberto Knox is the name of the philosopher who is teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Knox</b></font>) sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) packages via his (<font color='blue'><b>Knox</b></font>) dog Hermes. Alberto first tells Sophie that philosophy is extremely relevant to life and that if we do not question and ponder our very existence we are not really living. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alberto</b></font>) proceeds to go through the history of western philosophy. Alberto teaches Sophie about the ancient myths that people had in the days before they tried to come up with natural explanations for the processes in the world. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) learns about the natural philosophers who were concerned with change. Next Alberto describes Democritus and the theory of indivisible atoms underlying all of nature as well as the concept of fate. At the same time as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) takes the philosophy course, Sophie receives a strange postcard sent to Hilde MÃ¸ller Knag, care of Sophie. The postcard is from Hilde's father and wishes Hilde happy birthday. Sophie is confused, and moreso when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) finds a scarf with Hilde's name on it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) does not know what is happening but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) is sure that Hilde and the philosophy course must somehow be connected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hilde</b></font>) learns about Socrates, who was wise enough to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Socrates</b></font>) knew nothing. Then Alberto sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Hilde</b></font>) a video that shows him (<font color='blue'><b>Alberto</b></font>) in present day Athens and somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>Alberto</b></font>) seems to go back in time to ancient Athens. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hilde</b></font>) learns about Plato and his (<font color='blue'><b>Plato</b></font>) world of ideas and then about Aristotle, who critiqued Plato, classified much of the natural world, and founded logic and our theory of concepts. Then, as Sophie's education continues, the Hilde situation begins to get more complicated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hilde</b></font>) finds many more postcards to Hilde, and some of them are even dated on June 15, the day of Sophie will turn 15. The problem is that June 15 is still over a month away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) discovers some of this with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) best friend Joanna, and one of the postcards tells Hilde that one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Hilde</b></font>) will meet Sophie and also mentions Joanna. Strange things are happening that the girls cannot figure out. Sophie's relationship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) mother becomes somewhat strained as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) tries both to cover up the correspondence with Alberto and to practice her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) philosophical thinking on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) mom. Meanwhile, Alberto teaches Sophie about Jesus and the meeting of Indo-European and Semitic culture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) learns about St. Augustine, St. Aquinas, and the christianization of Greek philosophy that occurred in the Middle Ages. By this time, Sophie has met Alberto and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alberto</b></font>) begins hinting that the philosophy is about to get extremely relevant to the strange things that are happening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>). Sophie learns about the focus on humanity in the Renaissance and the extremes of the Baroque and then Alberto focuses on some key philosophers. Urgently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alberto</b></font>) teaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) about Descartes, who doubted, and by doing so knew at least that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alberto</b></font>) could doubt. They move on to Spinoza as it becomes clear that Hilde's father has some awesome power over them. Then Sophie learns about the empiricists. Locke believed in natural rights and that everything we know is gained from experience. Hume, an important influence on Kant, showed that our actions are guided by feelings and warned against making laws based upon our experiences. But Berkeley is most important to Sophie because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hume</b></font>) suggested that perhaps our entire lives were inside the mind of God. And Alberto says that their lives are inside the mind of Albert Knag, Hilde's father. At this point the story switches to Hilde's point of view. On June 15, the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Hilde</b></font>) turns fifteen, Hilde receives a birthday gift from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hilde</b></font>) father entitled Sophie's World. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) begins to read and is enthralled. We follow the rest of Sophie's story from Hilde's perspective. Hilde becomes certain that Sophie exists, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) is not just a character in a book. Alberto has a plan to escape Albert Knag's mind, and they must finish the philosophy course before that can happen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alberto</b></font>) teaches Sophie about the Enlightenment and its humane values and about Kant and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kant</b></font>) unification of empiricist and rationalist thought. Things in Sophie's life have become completely insane but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) and Alberto know they must figure out a way to do something. It will have to occur on the night of June 15, when Hilde's father returns home. They learn about the world spirit of Romanticism, Hegel's dialectical view of history, and Kierkegaard's belief that the individual's existence is primary. Meanwhile, Hilde plans a surprise for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hilde</b></font>) father on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) return home. They rush through Marx, Darwin, Freud, and Sartre, desperate to come up with a plan to escape even though everything they do is known by Hilde's father. Then at the end of Sophie's World, the book that Hilde is reading, while at a party for Sophie on June 15, Alberto and Sophie disappear. Hilde's father comes home and they talk about the book, and Hilde is sure that Sophie exists somewhere. Meanwhile, Sophie and Alberto have a new existence as spirit--they have escaped from Albert Knag's mind but they are invisible to other people and can walk right through them. Sophie wants to try to interfere in the world of Hilde and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hilde</b></font>) father, and at the end of the book she (<font color='blue'><b>Hilde</b></font>) is learning how to do so.
