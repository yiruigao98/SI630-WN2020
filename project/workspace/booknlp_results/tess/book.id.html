stunned to learn that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is the descendent of an ancient noble family, the
d'Urbervilles. Meanwhile, Tess, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eldest daughter, joins the other
village girls in the May Day dance, where Tess briefly exchanges
glances with a young man. Mr. Durbeyfield and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wife decide to
send Tess to the d'Urberville mansion, where they hope Mrs. d'Urberville
will make Tess's fortune. In reality, Mrs. d'Urberville is no relation
to Tess at all: her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband, the merchant Simon Stokes, simply changed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) name to d'Urberville after he (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) retired. But Tess does not know
this fact, and when the lascivious Alec d'Urberville, Mrs. d'Urberville's
son, procures Tess a job tending fowls on the d'Urberville estate,
Tess has no choice but to accept, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) blames herself for an
accident involving the family's horse, its only means of income. Tess spends several months at this job, resisting Alec's
attempts to seduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Finally, Alec takes advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in
the woods one night after a fair. Tess knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) does not love Alec.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) returns home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) family to give birth to Alec's child, whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) christens Sorrow. Sorrow dies soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) is born, and Tess
spends a miserable year at home before deciding to seek work elsewhere.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) finally accepts a job as a milkmaid at the Talbothays Dairy. At Talbothays, Tess enjoys a period of contentment and
happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) befriends three of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fellow milkmaids--Izz, Retty,
and Marian--and meets a man named Angel Clare, who turns out to be the
man from the May Day dance at the beginning of the novel. Tess and
Angel slowly fall in love. They grow closer throughout Tess's time
at Talbothays, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eventually accepts his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) proposal of marriage.
Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) is troubled by pangs of conscience and feels she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) should
tell Angel about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) writes him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) a confessional note and
slips it under his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) door, but it slides under the carpet and Angel never
sees it. After their wedding, Angel and Tess both confess indiscretions: Angel
tells Tess about an affair he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had with an older woman in London,
and Tess tells Angel about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) history with Alec. Tess forgives Angel,
but Angel cannot forgive Tess. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) some money and boards
a ship bound for Brazil, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) might establish a farm.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) tells Tess he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) will try to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) past but warns her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) not to try
to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) comes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Tess struggles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) has a difficult time finding work
and is forced to take a job at an unpleasant and unprosperous farm.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tries to visit Angel's family but overhears his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) brothers discussing
Angel's poor marriage, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) leaves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hears a wandering preacher
speak and is stunned to discover that he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) is Alec d'Urberville, who
has been converted to Christianity by Angel's father, the Reverend
Clare. Alec and Tess are each shaken by their encounter, and Alec
appallingly begs Tess never to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) again. Soon after, however,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) again begs Tess to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>), having turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) -religious
ways. Tess learns from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sister Liza-Lu that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother is
near death, and Tess is forced to return home to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother recovers, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father unexpectedly dies soon after.
When the family is evicted from their home, Alec offers help. But
Tess refuses to accept, knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) only wants to obligate her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) again. At last, Angel decides to forgive his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) leaves
Brazil, desperate to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother, who
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) Tess has gone to a village called Sandbourne. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
finds Tess in an expensive boardinghouse called The Herons, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) has forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) and begs her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) back.
Tess tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) has come too late. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was unable to resist and
went back to Alec d'Urberville. Angel leaves in a daze, and, heartbroken
to the point of madness, Tess goes upstairs and stabs her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lover
to death. When the landlady finds Alec's body, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) raises an alarm,
but Tess has already fled to find Angel. Angel agrees to help Tess, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) cannot quite believe
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) has actually murdered Alec. They hide out in an empty mansion
for a few days, then travel farther. When they come to Stonehenge,
Tess goes to sleep, but when morning breaks shortly thereafter,
a search party discovers them. Tess is arrested and sent to jail.
Angel and Liza-Lu watch as a black flag is raised over the prison,
signaling Tess's execution.
