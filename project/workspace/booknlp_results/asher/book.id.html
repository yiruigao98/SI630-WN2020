His (<font color='blue'><b>Lev</b></font>) father, Aryeh, is an emissary for the Rebbe, the leader of the Ladover Hasidic community. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Rebbe</b></font>) is younger, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rebbe</b></font>) uncle, His (<font color='blue'><b>Rebbe</b></font>) mother Rivkeh's brother, dies and it destroys her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Asher's mother becomes ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stays at home sick for a while after being released from the hospital. At this time, Asher spends much time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) father at his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) office and becomes entranced by the work his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) father is doing in Russia. Furthering Asher's fascination with Russia is recent immigrant, Yudel Krinsky, whom Aryeh helped bring to the US and whom Asher befriends. As Rivkeh's health improves, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) decides that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wants to go to college. Aryeh asks the Rebbe for permission, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rebbe</b></font>) grants. Asher's early summers are spent in a bungalow colony. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) has opportunity to grow closer with his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) mother. Aryeh's work with Russia intensifies. The entire community, Asher included seems obsessed with the Russians and their persecution of Jews. Asher begins visiting with Krinsky more and often returns home late, causing his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) mother great worry. The Rebbe asks Asher's father to move to Vienna in order to better perform his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) work. Asher does not want to move to Vienna and makes this known to his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) parents, his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) uncle, and Krinsky. Asher begins drawing again. Asher's parents and teachers are concerned about him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>). Asher asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) can live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) uncle. Asher's father begins to worry about his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) son's drawing. Asher draws a menacing looking picture of the Rebbe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) Chumash one day in class. The Mashpia calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) in to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) is doing. Asher breaks down and expresses how distraught he (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) is over the prospect of moving to Vienna. The Rebbe decides that Asher cannot be brought to Vienna. Aryeh moves to Vienna alone. Rivkeh and Asher adjust to life at home together. His (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) interest in art intensifies and she (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) buys him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) oil paints. Asher begins to neglect his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) studies, rousing the concern and ire of his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) teachers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) father. Asher seems unfazed by the criticism heaped on him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) mother takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) to the museum and explains the paintings of crucifixions to him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>). Asher begins to sketch crucifixions and nudes. These arouse the ire of Aryeh, who discovers them when he (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) returns home for Passover. When Aryeh leaves to go back to Europe, Asher resolves to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) scholastic performance. The next summer, Rivkeh joins Aryeh in Europe and Asher stays with his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) Uncle Yitzchok. Asher has a meeting with the Rebbe before his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) Bar Mitzvah. Jacob Kahn, a prominent artist, has been called to the Rebbe's office and introduces himself to Asher as Asher is leaving. The Rebbe has decided that Asher shall study art with Kahn. Kahn gives Asher an assignment and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) in two months. Asher calls Kahn and arranges to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) studio for the first time. At this first meeting, Kahn introduces Asher to gallery owner Anna Schaeffer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) also berates Asher and tries to scare him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) out of becoming an artist. Asher is not deterred. Kahn takes Asher to see paintings of crucifixions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) brings a woman into the studio to model so Asher can paint nudes. Asher's mother begins contemplating a move to Vienna. Asher, however, refuses to go along. Rivkeh finally decides to move to Vienna without him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can be with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband. Asher meets with the Rebbe to discuss this move and his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) developing artistic talent. Around this time, Asher learns that he (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) will one day have his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) own show. Asher moves in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) Uncle Yitzchok. Asher spends the summer with Jacob Kahn at his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) beach house in Provincetown. It is a joyous summer dedicated to painting. Asher maintains his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) religious observance while there. Toward the end, Jacob Kahn withdraws for a few days, in an awful mood. Asher begins high school, but continues studying with Kahn on weekends. Kahn has a show opening that fall. Asher's uncle renovates the attic to give Asher more space to paint. Asher and Jacob begin to travel to some exhibitions together. Asher's parents return for Passover, and Asher and Aryeh fight. Asher's family pressures him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) to try moving to Vienna. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) goes, gets sick, and comes back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) first art show and it is a moderate success. Asher is now in college. His (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) parents return home after years in Europe. It is awkward living with his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) parents again. Asher's parents are unhappy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) includes nudes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) next show. Asher tries to explain art to his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) father, but it is a miserable failure and they get frustrated with each other. Asher begins to plan a trip to Europe. Asher goes to Florence and is enthralled by the artwork. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) is particularly taken with Michelangelo's Pietà. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) moves on to Rome and then Paris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) begins to experiment with alterations in the Pietà, alterations in the artistic form of the crucifix. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) decides to move to Paris temporarily, gets an apartment, and sets up a studio. In Paris he (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) has time to reflect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) past, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) upbringing, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) community, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) realizes the pain his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) mother went through during his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) upbringing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) wants to express this in art--the only symbol he (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) has at his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) disposal is the crucifixion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) makes two paintings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) mother that employ the crucifix. At a major show in New York, Asher displays these paintings. His (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) parents are horrified by the paintings, as is the general Ladover community. Asher has crossed a line. His (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) parents become cold toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) as do all the Ladover who one supported him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>). The Rebbe calls Asher into his (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) office and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Asher</b></font>) to leave the community. Banished, Asher moves back to Paris.
