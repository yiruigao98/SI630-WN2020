Because of Amendments 211, 212, and 213 to the Constitution, every American is fully equal, meaning that no one is stupider, uglier, weaker, or slower than anyone else. The Handicapper General and a team of agents ensure that the laws of equality are enforced. One April, fourteen-year-old Harrison Bergeron is taken away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bergeron</b></font>) parents, George and Hazel, by the government. George and Hazel aren't fully aware of the tragedy. Hazel's lack of awareness is due to average intelligence. In 2081, those who possess average intelligence are unable to think for extended stretches of time. George can't comprehend the tragedy because the law requires him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to wear a radio twenty-four hours a day. The government broadcasts noise over these radios to interrupt the thoughts of intelligent people like George. Hazel and George are watching ballerinas dance on TV. Hazel has been crying, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) can't remember why. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) remarks on the prettiness of the dance. For a few moments, George reflects on the dancers, who are weighed down to counteract their gracefulness and masked to counteract their good looks. They have been handicapped so that TV viewers won't feel bad about their own appearance. Because of their handicaps, the dancers aren't very good. A noise interrupts George's thoughts. Two of the dancers onscreen hear the noise, too; apparently, they are smart and must wear radios as well. Hazel says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) would enjoy hearing the noises that the handicappers dream up. George seems skeptical. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) were Handicapper General, Hazel says, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) would create a chime noise to use on Sundays, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) thinks would produce a religious effect. The narrator explains that Hazel strongly resembles Diana Moon Glampers, Handicapper General. Hazel says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) would be a good Handicapper General, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) knows what normalcy is. Before being interrupted by another noise, George thinks of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son, Harrison. Hazel thinks George looks exhausted and urges him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to lie down and rest his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``handicap bag,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>forty-seven pounds of weight placed in a bag and locked around George's neck. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hardly notices the weight anymore. Hazel suggests taking a few of the weights out of the bag, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says if everyone broke the law, society would return to its old competitive ways. Hazel says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) would hate that. A noise interrupts the conversation, and George can't remember what they were talking about. On TV, an announcer with a speech impediment attempts to read a bulletin. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can't overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) impediment, so he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands the bulletin to a ballerina to read. Hazel commends him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) for working with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) God-given abilities and says he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should get a raise simply for trying so hard. The ballerina begins reading in her (<font color='blue'><b>ballerina</b></font>) natural, beautiful voice, then apologizes and switches to a growly voice that won't make anyone jealous. The bulletin says that Harrison has escaped from prison. A photo of Harrison appears on the screen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) is wearing the handicaps meant to counteract his (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) strength, intelligence, and good looks. The photo shows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) is seven feet tall and covered in 300 pounds of metal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) is wearing huge earphones, rather than a small radio, and big glasses meant to blind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) headaches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) is also wearing a red rubber nose and black caps over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) teeth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) eyebrows are shaved off. After a rumbling noise, the photo on the Bergerons' TV screen is replaced with an image of Harrison himself, who has stormed the studio. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) is the emperor, the greatest ruler in history, and that everyone must obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) rips off all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) handicaps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) looks like a god. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) says that the first woman brave enough to stand up will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) empress. A ballerina rises to her (<font color='blue'><b>ballerina</b></font>) feet. Harrison removes her (<font color='blue'><b>ballerina</b></font>) handicaps and mask, revealing a beautiful woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) orders the musicians to play, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) will make them royalty if they do their best. Unhappy with their initial attempt, Harrison conducts, waving a couple of musicians in the air like batons, and sings. They try again and do better. After listening to the music, Harrison and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) empress dance. Defying gravity, they move through the air, flying thirty feet upward to the ceiling, which they kiss. Then, still in the air, they kiss each other. Diana Moon Glampers comes into the studio and kills Harrison and the empress with a shotgun. Training the gun on the musicians, she (<font color='blue'><b>empress</b></font>) orders them to put their handicaps on. The Bergerons' screen goes dark. George, who has left the room to get a beer, returns and asks Hazel why she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) has been crying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) says something sad happened on TV, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) can't remember exactly what. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) not to remember sad things. A noise sounds in George's head, and Hazel says it sounded like a doozy. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) can say that again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) repeats that it sounded like a doozy.
