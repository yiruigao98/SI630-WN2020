the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that
has replaced the United States of America. Because of dangerously
low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children
for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the
Commander and his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander</b></font>) wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate
for <div class="bookquote">``traditional values.''  (<font color='red'><b>advocate</b></font>)</div>Offred is not the narrator's real name--Handmaid
names consist of the word <div class="bookquote">``of''  (<font color='red'><b>Handmaid</b></font>)</div>followed by the name of the Handmaid's
Commander. Every month, when Offred is at the right point in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>)
menstrual cycle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) must have impersonal, wordless sex with the
Commander while Serena sits behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>), holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) hands. Offred's
freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>)
room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead's secret police
force, watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) every public move. As Offred tells the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) daily life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) frequently
slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the
events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world,
before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
divorced his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) wife and married Offred, and they had a child together.
Offred's mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred's
best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of
Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available
pornography, prostitution, and violence against women--when pollution
and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the
military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress
and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily.
They cracked down on women's rights, forbidding women to hold property
or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee
across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated
from one another, and Offred has seen neither her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband nor her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
daughter since. After her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) capture, Offred's marriage was voided -LRB-because
Luke had been divorced-RRB-, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was sent to the Rachel and Leah
Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants. At
the center, women were indoctrinated into Gilead's ideology in preparation
for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia supervised the women, giving
speeches extolling Gilead's beliefs that women should be subservient
to men and solely concerned with bearing children. Aunt Lydia also
argued that such a social order ultimately offers women more respect
and safety than the old, pre-Gilead society offered them. Moira
is brought to the Red Center, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Moira</b></font>) escapes, and Offred does not
know what becomes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Moira</b></font>). Once assigned to the Commander's house, Offred's life
settles into a restrictive routine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Moira</b></font>) takes shopping trips with
Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used
to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She (<font color='blue'><b>Moira</b></font>) must
visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other
complications, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Moira</b></font>) must endure the <div class="bookquote">``Ceremony,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in which the
Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom,
where his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander</b></font>) Wife and Offred wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Commander</b></font>), and has sex with Offred.
The first break from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) routine occurs when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) visits the doctor
and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) offers to have sex with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) pregnant, suggesting
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) Commander is probably infertile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) refuses. The doctor
makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) uneasy, but his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) proposition is too risky--she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) could be
sent away if caught. After a Ceremony, the Commander sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander</b></font>) gardener
and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) study
the following night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) begins visiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) regularly. They play
Scrabble -LRB-which is forbidden, since women are not allowed to read-RRB-,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) lets her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) look at old magazines like Vogue. At
the end of these secret meetings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>). During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to
Offred that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) is a member of <div class="bookquote">``Mayday,''  (<font color='red'><b>a member organization</b></font>)</div>an underground organization
dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that
the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) knows
the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the
new order that the Commander and his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander</b></font>) fellow leaders have created
in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) is, the Commander
remarks, <div class="bookquote">``-LSB-Y-RSB-ou can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.''  (<font color='red'><b>Commander</b></font>)</div>After some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena
suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child
off as the Commander's. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) daughter if she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes that
Serena has always known the whereabouts of Offred's daughter. The
same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly
takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) out to a club called Jezebel's, where the Commanders mingle
with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women
meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Moira</b></font>) crossed the border. She (<font color='blue'><b>Moira</b></font>) chose life in Jezebel's over
being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and dangerous
people are sent. After that night at Jezebel's, Offred says, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moira</b></font>)
never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after
a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Moira</b></font>) tries to feign passion. Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel's, late at night,
Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick's room. Offred and
Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without
anyone's knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen's
requests that she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) gather information from the Commander for Mayday.
One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed
rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow.
Later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of
Mayday and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hit him (<font color='blue'><b>rapist</b></font>) to put him (<font color='blue'><b>rapist</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>rapist</b></font>) misery. Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new
Ofglen meets her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw the
secret police coming for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). At home, Serena has found out about
Offred's trip to Jezebel's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) room, promising
punishment. Offred waits there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) sees a black van from the
Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) that the Eyes are
really Mayday members who have come to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>). Offred leaves with them,
over the Commander's futile objections, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) way either to prison
or to freedom--she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) does not know which. The novel closes with an epilogue from 2195,
after Gilead has fallen, written in the form of a lecture given
by Professor Pieixoto. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) explains the formation and customs of
Gilead in objective, analytical language. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) discusses the significance
of Offred's story, which has turned up on cassette tapes in Bangor,
Maine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) suggests that Nick arranged Offred's escape but that her (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>)
fate after that is unknown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) could have escaped to Canada or
England, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Serena</b></font>) could have been recaptured.
