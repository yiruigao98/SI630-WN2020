With his (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) aunt, the boy views the corpse and visits with the priest's
mourning sisters. As the boy listens, the sisters explain Father
Flynn's death to the aunt and share thoughts about Father Flynn's
increasingly strange behavior. Fed up with the restraints of school and inspired by adventure
stories, two boys skip their classes to explore Dublin. After walking around
the city for a while, the unnamed narrator and his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) friend, Mahony,
eventually rest in a field. A strange old man approaches and talks
to them, and his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) sexual innuendos make the narrator uncomfortable.
Ultimately, the narrator and Mahony manage to escape. A young boy falls in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neighbor Mangan's sister.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spends his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) time watching her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) house or thinking about
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and the girl finally talk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suggests that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) visit
a bazaar called Araby, which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cannot attend. The boy plans to
go and purchase something for the girl, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arrives late and
buys nothing. A young woman, Eveline, sits in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house and reviews
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) decision to elope with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover, Frank, to Argentina. Eveline
wonders if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has made the correct choice to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) home and
family. As the moment of departure approaches, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reaffirms her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
decision, but changes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind at the docks and abandons Frank. Jimmy Doyle spends an evening and night with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) well-connected foreign
friends after watching a car race outside of Dublin. Upon returning
to the city, they meet for a fancy meal and then spend hours drinking,
dancing, and playing card games. Intoxicated and infatuated with
the wealth and prestige of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) companions, Jimmy ends the celebrations
broke. Lenehan and Corley walk through Dublin and discuss their
plot to swindle a housemaid who works at a wealthy residence. Corley meets
with the girl while Lenehan drifts through the city and eats a cheap
meal. Later in the night Lenehan goes to the residence as planned
and sees the girl retrieve something from the house for Corley.
Finally Corley reveals to Lenehan that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) procured a gold coin for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>). In the boarding house that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) runs, Mrs. Mooney observes
the courtship between her (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) daughter, Polly, and a tenant, Mr. Doran. Mrs.
Mooney intercedes only when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) knows Mr. Doran must propose to
Polly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) schedules a meeting with Mr. Doran to discuss his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>)
intentions. Mr. Doran anxiously anticipates the conversation and
the potential lifestyle change that awaits him (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) resolves that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>)
must marry Polly. One evening after work Little Chandler reunites with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>)
old friend, Gallaher. Little Chandler aspires to be a poet, and
hearing about Gallaher's career in London makes Little Chandler
envious and determined to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) life. Little Chandler imagines
freedom from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) wife and child, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) feels ashamed about his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>)
thoughts and accepts his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) situation. After an infuriating day at work, Farrington embarks on
an evening of drinking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) friends. Even though Farrington
pawns his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) watch to replenish his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) empty wallet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) finds himself
spending all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) money on drinks for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) companions.
Growing more and more frustrated, Farrington almost explodes when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) loses an arm-wrestling match. At home later that night, Farrington
vents his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) anger by beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) son. On Halloween night, Maria oversees festivities at the
charity where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) works. Afterward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) travels to the home of Joe
Donnelly, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) nursed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Donnelly</b></font>) was a boy. Along the way Maria
purchases sweets and cakes for Joe's family. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) arrives at
the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) realizes she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has somehow lost the special plum cake
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)'d bought. After talking, eating, and playing Halloween games,
Maria sings a song for the Donnellys. Mr. Duffy develops a relationship with Mrs. Sinico at
a concert in Dublin. The two meet often for long chats and become
close, but Mr. Duffy cuts off the relationship when Mrs. Sinico
makes the intimate but chaste gesture of taking Mr. Duffy's hand
and putting it against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) cheek. Four years later, Mr. Duffy reads
in a newspaper that Mrs. Sinico has died in a train accident. He (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>)
feels angry, sad, and uneasy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) finally
realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) lost perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) only chance for love. A group of men working as street promoters for a mayoral
candidate meet to discuss their jobs and escape from the rainy weather
on Ivy Day, which commemorates the death of Charles Stuart Parnell, the
influential Irish politician. The men complain about their late paychecks
and debate politics. Conversation eventually turns to Parnell and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Parnell</b></font>) political endeavors, and one of the men, Hynes, recites a poem
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) wrote in memory of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>). An Irish cultural society organizes a concert series with
the help of Mrs. Kearney, the mother of one of the performers. Mrs.
Kearney secures a contract with the society's secretary, Mr. Holohan,
so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter is ensured payment for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) piano accompaniment.
A series of logistical changes and failed expectations infuriate
Mrs. Kearney, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) hounds the officers of the society for the
money, making a spectacle of herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter. After an embarrassing public accident, Tom Kernan is convinced
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) friends to attend a Catholic retreat. The men hope that this
event will help Mr. Kernan reform his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) problematic, alcoholic lifestyle.
At the service, the presiding priest preaches about the need for
the admission of sins and the ability of all people to attain forgiveness through
God's grace. With his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife, Gretta, Gabriel Conroy attends the annual
dancing party hosted by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) two aging aunts, Julia and Kate Morkan,
and their niece, Mary Jane. At the party, Gabriel experiences some uncomfortable
confrontations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) makes a personal comment to Lily, the housemaid,
that provokes a sharp reply, and during a dance he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) endures the taunts
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) partner, Miss Ivors. Finally, Gabriel sees Gretta enraptured
by a song sung toward the end of the party. Later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) learns that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) was thinking of a former lover who had died for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sadly
contemplates his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) life.
