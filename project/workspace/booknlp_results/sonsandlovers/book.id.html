She (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) has many arguments with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband, some of which have painful results: on separate occasions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) is locked out of the house and hit in the head with a drawer. Estranged from her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) husband, Mrs. Morel takes comfort in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) four children, especially her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) sons. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) oldest son, William, is her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) favorite, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) is very upset when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) takes a job in London and moves away from the family. When William sickens and dies a few years later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) is crushed, not even noticing the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) children until she (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) almost loses Paul, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) second son, as well. From that point on, Paul becomes the focus of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>) life, and the two seem to live for each other. Paul falls in love with Miriam Leivers, who lives on a farm not too far from the Morel family. They carry on a very intimate, but purely platonic, relationship for many years. Mrs. Morel does not approve of Miriam, and this may be the main reason that Paul does not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) constantly wavers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feelings toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Morel</b></font>). Paul meets Clara Dawes, a suffragette who is separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) husband, through Miriam. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) becomes closer with Clara and they begin to discuss his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) relationship with Miriam, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) should consider consummating their love and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) returns to Miriam to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) feels. Paul and Miriam sleep together and are briefly happy, but shortly afterward Paul decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) does not want to marry Miriam, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) breaks off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>) still feels that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul belongs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miriam</b></font>), and, in part agrees reluctantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loves his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother most, however. After breaking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) relationship with Miriam, Paul begins to spend more time with Clara and they begin an extremely passionate affair. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) does not want to divorce her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) husband Baxter, and so they can never be married. Paul's mother falls ill and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) devotes much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) time to caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) finally dies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is broken-hearted and, after a final plea from Miriam, goes off alone at the end of the novel.
