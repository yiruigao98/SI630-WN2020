recalls a Christmas Eve gathering at an old house, where guests
listen to one another's ghost stories. A guest named Douglas introduces
a story that involves two children--Flora and Miles--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) sister's
governess, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was in love. After procuring the governess's
written record of events from his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) provides a few introductory
details. A handsome bachelor persuaded the governess to take a position
as governess for his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) niece and nephew in an isolated country home
after the previous governess died. Douglas begins to read from the
written record, and the story shifts to the governess's point of view
as she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) narrates her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) strange experience. The governess begins her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) story with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) first day at Bly,
the country home, where she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) meets Flora and a maid named Mrs. Grose.
The governess is nervous but feels relieved by Flora's beauty and
charm. The next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) receives a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) employer, which
contains a letter from Miles's headmaster saying that Miles cannot
return to school. The letter does not specify what Miles has done
to deserve expulsion, and, alarmed, the governess questions Mrs.
Grose about it. Mrs. Grose admits that Miles has on occasion been
bad, but only in the ways boys ought to be. The governess is reassured
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) drives to meet Miles. One evening, as the governess strolls around the grounds,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) sees a strange man in a tower of the house and exchanges an
intense stare with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) says nothing to Mrs. Grose. Later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>)
catches the same man glaring into the dining-room window, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>)
rushes outside to investigate. The man is gone, and the governess
looks into the window from outside. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) image in the window frightens
Mrs. Grose, who has just walked into the room. The governess discusses
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) two experiences with Mrs. Grose, who identifies the strange
man as Peter Quint, a former valet who is now dead. Convinced that the ghost seeks Miles, the governess becomes
rigid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) supervision of the children. One day, when the governess
is at the lake with Flora, she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) sees a woman dressed in black and
senses that the woman is Miss Jessel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessel</b></font>) dead predecessor. The
governess is certain Flora was aware of the ghost's presence but
intentionally kept quiet. The governess again questions Mrs. Grose
about Miles's misbehavior. Mrs. Grose reveals that Quint had been
<div class="bookquote">``too free''  (<font color='red'><b>Quint/Peter Quint</b></font>)</div>with Miles, and Miss Jessel with Flora. The governess
is on her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) guard, but the days pass without incident, and Miles and
Flora express increased affection for the governess. The lull is broken one evening when something startles
the governess from her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) reading. She (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) rises to investigate, moving
to the landing above the staircase. There, a gust of wind extinguishes
her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) candle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) sees Quint halfway up the stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) refuses
to back down, exchanging another intense stare with Quint until
he (<font color='blue'><b>Quint</b></font>) vanishes. Back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) room, the governess finds Flora's bed curtains
pulled forward, but Flora herself is missing. Noticing movement
under the window blind, the governess watches as Flora emerges from
behind it. The governess questions Flora about what she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>)'s been doing,
but Flora's explanation is unrevealing. The governess does not sleep well during the next few
nights. One night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) sees the ghost of Miss Jessel sitting on
the bottom stair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessel</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessel</b></font>) hands. Later, when the governess
finally allows herself to go to sleep at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessel</b></font>) regular hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessel</b></font>) is
awoken after midnight to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessel</b></font>) candle extinguished and Flora
by the window. Careful not to disturb Flora, the governess leaves
the room to find a window downstairs that overlooks the same view.
Looking out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) sees the faraway figure of Miles on the lawn. Later, the governess discusses with Mrs. Grose her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) conversation
with Miles, who claimed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wanted to show the governess that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) could be <div class="bookquote">``bad.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The governess concludes that Flora and Miles
frequently meet with Miss Jessel and Quint. At this, Mrs. Grose
urges the governess to appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) employer, but the governess
refuses, reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) colleague that the children's uncle does
not want to be bothered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) threatens to leave if Mrs. Grose writes
to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). On the walk to church one Sunday, Miles broaches the topic
of school to the governess. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wants to go back and declares
he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) will make his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) uncle come to Bly. The governess, shaken, does
not go into church. Instead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) returns to the house and plots
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) departure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) sits on the bottom stair but springs up when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) remembers seeing Miss Jessel there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessel</b></font>) enters the schoolroom
and finds Miss Jessel sitting at the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessel</b></font>) screams at the ghost,
and the ghost vanishes. The governess decides she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessel</b></font>) will stay at Bly.
Mrs. Grose and the children return, saying nothing about the governess's
absence at church. The governess agrees to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) employer. That evening, the governess listens outside Miles's door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) invites her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) in, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) questions him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) embraces him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) impulsively.
The candle goes out, and Miles shrieks. The next day Miles plays
the piano for the governess. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) suddenly realizes she (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) doesn't know
where Flora is. She (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) and Mrs. Grose find Flora by the lake. There,
the governess sees an apparition of Miss Jessel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessel</b></font>) points it out
to Flora and Mrs. Grose, but both claim not to see it.
Flora says that the governess is cruel and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) wants to get
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>), and the governess collapses on the ground in hysterics.
The next day, Mrs. Grose informs the governess that Flora is sick. They
decide Mrs. Grose will take Flora to the children's uncle while
the governess stays at Bly with Miles. Mrs. Grose informs the governess
that Luke didn't send the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) employer, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) couldn't find it. With Flora and Mrs. Grose gone, Miles and the
governess talk after dinner. The governess asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) letter.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) confesses, and the governess sees Quint outside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grose</b></font>) watches
Quint in horror, then points him (<font color='blue'><b>Quint</b></font>) out to Miles, who asks if it is
Peter Quint and looks out the window in vain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) cries out, then
falls into the governess's arms, dead.
