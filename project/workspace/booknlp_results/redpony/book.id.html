Each story centers on a boy named Jody; the four together show him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in a critical time of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) childhood. In the first story, Jody is ten years old. The stories are close together in chronological time; indeed, Steinbeck is careful to remind readers that Jody is a <div class="bookquote">``little boy''  (<font color='red'><b>Jody</b></font>)</div>at the start of each story. This story describes Carl Tiflin's family and ranch, which will be the setting of all four stories. Jody is Carl's son. Another central character is Billy Buck, the ranch's single employed hand. While Carl is a stern, unemotional man, Billy is warmer, and spends a lot of time teaching Jody how to take care of horses. The ranch includes several horses, along with cows and pigs. In this first story, Carl gives Jody a red pony, which Jody names Gabilan. Every morning Jody brushes the horse and after school works on training it. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carl</b></font>) is about to teach Gabilan to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Carl</b></font>) ride him (<font color='blue'><b>Carl</b></font>), the horse catches a bad cold in the rain. Billy had promised Jody that the horse would not get sick. Eventually, Billy has to resort to drastic measures to try to save Gabilan, cutting open a sack of puss then carving a breathing hold in the horse's throat. Unfortunately, the horse escapes one night, and Jody finds vultures preying on the corpse the next morning. Jody kills one of the vultures and is reprimanded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) father, but Billy defends him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>). Jody is bored. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) looks with longing at the great mountains, wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) could explore them. Suddenly, an old Mexican man named Gitano appears, claiming he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) was born on the ranch. Gitano requests to stay on the farm until he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) dies. Carl Tiflin refuses, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Tiflin</b></font>) does allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Tiflin</b></font>) to stay the night. That night, Jody secretly visits Gitano. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tiflin</b></font>) is polishing an old sword. Jody asks if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tiflin</b></font>) has ever been to the great mountains, and Gitano says he (<font color='blue'><b>Tiflin</b></font>) has but remembers little. The next morning Gitano is gone. A neighbor reports seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tiflin</b></font>) riding into the mountains with something in hand--the rapier, Jody assumes. Jody is filled with longing at the thought. Billy Buck and Carl Tiflin decide Jody should raise a colt from birth. Jody is sent with Nellie, a mare, to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Jody</b></font>) bred. The breeding is expensive; Jody works extra hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nellie</b></font>) chores to repay his (<font color='blue'><b>Nellie</b></font>) father, but eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>Nellie</b></font>) grows tired of waiting. Also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nellie</b></font>) is wary that Billy will let something go wrong, as happened with Gabilan. This hurts Billy's feelings. Finally, it comes time for the colt to be born, but the birthing is complicated. Nellie becomes very ill. Billy discovers that something is wrong with the birth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) has to kill Nellie and cut the colt out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jody</b></font>) stomach with his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) pocketknife. The Tiflins' receive a letter from Jody's maternal grandfather, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) is coming to visit. Jody's father is upset, and argues with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife, complaining that the grandfather simply repeats his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stories about crossing the Great Plains as the head of a wagon train. Jody goes down the road to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grandfather. That night, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grandfather begins his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) usual stories, but everyone is polite. The next morning, the grandfather is late coming down to breakfast, and Carl begins to openly complain about him (<font color='blue'><b>Carl</b></font>). Suddenly the grandfather walks in, having heard everything. For once in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) life, Carl has to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Carl</b></font>) words. After breakfast, Jody sits with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carl</b></font>) grandfather on the porch. Eventually, the grandfather begins talking about how he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) really feels, about how he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) wonders if it was really worth it to cross the plains. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) says that what was important was not crossing the plains, but the act of leading people across it. Jody says that someday he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) will be a leader of the people, but his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) grandfather replies that the days of exploration are over.
