attractive, confident, middle-aged black woman, returns to Eatonville,
Florida, after a long absence. The black townspeople gossip about
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and -speculate about where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been and what has happened
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) young husband, Tea Cake. They take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) confidence as aloofness,
but Janie's friend Pheoby Watson sticks up for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Pheoby visits
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to find out what has happened. Their conversation frames the
story that Janie relates. Janie explains that her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) grandmother raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) after her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>)
mother ran off. Nanny loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>) granddaughter and is dedicated to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>) life as a slave and experience with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>) own daughter,
Janie's mother, has warped her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) worldview. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) primary desire is
to marry Janie as soon as possible to a husband who can provide
security and social status for her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) finds a much older farmer
named Logan Killicks and insists that Janie marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Logan</b></font>). After moving in with Logan, Janie is miserable. Logan
is pragmatic and unromantic and, in general, treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) like a pack
mule. One day, Joe Starks, a smooth-tongued and ambitious man, ambles down
the road in front of the farm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Starks</b></font>) and Janie flirt in secret for
a couple weeks before she (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) runs off and marries him (<font color='blue'><b>Starks</b></font>). Janie and Jody, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Starks</b></font>), travel to all-black
Eatonville, where Jody hopes to have a <div class="bookquote">``big voice.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jody</b></font>)</div>A consummate
politician, Jody soon succeeds in becoming the mayor, postmaster,
storekeeper, and the biggest landlord in town. But Janie seeks something
more than a man with a big voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) soon becomes disenchanted
with the monotonous, stifling life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) shares with Jody. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jody</b></font>)
wishes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jody</b></font>) could be a part of the rich social life in town,
but Jody doesn't allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Jody</b></font>) to interact with <div class="bookquote">``common''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>people. Jody
sees Janie as the fitting ornament to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wealth and power, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tries to shape her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vision of what a mayor's wife should
be. On the surface, Janie silently submits to Jody; inside, however,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) remains passionate and full of dreams. After almost two decades of marriage, Janie finally asserts
herself. When Jody insults her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) appearance, Janie rips him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to shreds
in front of the townspeople, telling them all how ugly and impotent
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is. In retaliation, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) savagely beats her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>). Their marriage breaks
down, and Jody becomes quite ill. After months without interacting,
Janie visits him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deathbed. Refusing to be silenced,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) once again chastises him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the way that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>). As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) berates him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dies. After Jody's funeral, Janie feels free for the first time
in years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) rebuffs various suitors who come to court her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) newfound independence. But when Tea Cake, a man twelve
years her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) junior, enters her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) life, Janie immediately senses a spark
of mutual attraction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) begins dating Tea Cake despite critical
gossip within the town. To everyone's shock, Janie then marries
Tea Cake nine months after Jody's death, sells Jody's store, and
leaves town to go with Tea Cake to Jacksonville. During the first week of their marriage, Tea
Cake and Janie encounter difficulties. He (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) steals her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) money and leaves
her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) alone one night, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) think that he (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) only for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) money. But he (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) returns, explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) never meant to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>)
and that his (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) theft occurred in a moment of weakness. Afterward,
they promise to share all their experiences and opinions with each
other. They move to the Everglades, where they work during the harvest
season and socialize during the summer off-season. Tea Cake's quick
wit and friendliness make their shack the center of entertainment
and social life. A terrible hurricane bursts into the Everglades two years
after Janie and Tea Cake's marriage. As they desperately flee the
rising waters, a rabid dog bites Tea Cake. At the time, Tea Cake
doesn't realize the dog's condition; three weeks later, however,
he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) falls ill. During a rabies--induced bout of madness, Tea Cake
becomes convinced that Janie is cheating on him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) starts firing
a pistol at her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) and Janie is forced to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) life.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) is immediately put on trial for murder, but the all-white, all-male
jury finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) not guilty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) returns to Eatonville where her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) former
neighbors are ready to spin malicious gossip about her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) circumstances,
assuming that Tea Cake has left her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) and taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) money. Janie wraps
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) recounting to Pheoby, who is greatly impressed by Janie's
experiences. Back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Janie</b></font>) room that night, Janie feels at one with
Tea Cake and at peace with herself.
