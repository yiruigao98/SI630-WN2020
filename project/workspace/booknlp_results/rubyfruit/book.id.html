with her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) adoptive parents in poor, rural Coffee Hollow, Pennsylvania. A sharp child,
she (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) devises a moneymaking scheme one day after finding out that her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) friend Broccoli
Detwiler has an odd-looking penis. Molly charges a nickel to look at Broccoli's
penis and a dime to touch it. The business thrives among Molly's schoolmates until
Earl Stambach, another classmate, tattles on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to their teacher, Miss Martin. Miss
Martin tells Carrie, Molly's adoptive mother, who explodes with rage when Molly
comes home from school. Among insults and rebukes, Carrie tells Molly she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is a
bastard, the daughter of a slut named Ruby Drollinger. Molly spends much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) early childhood playing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) slow-witted cousin,
Leroy. Together, they work on the family farm, picking bugs from the potato patch
and devising schemes to torment Earl. Even at this point in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) life, Molly knows
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is different from others. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is dark-featured, whereas others are fair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
is more intelligent and athletic. Carrie urges her (<font color='blue'><b>Carrie</b></font>) to be more ladylike, but Molly
runs around with the boys, feeling unrestricted by the conventional rules of gender
that dictate she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should like playing with dolls or playing nurse. Shortly after the incident with Broccoli, Leroy's mother, Jenna, has a baby
and names him (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>) after Molly's kind adoptive father, Carl. The baby dies after only two
days, however, and Jenna dies a few weeks later of cancer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenna</b></font>)'d known about the
cancer for a while but kept it secret from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenna</b></font>) husband, Ep, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenna</b></font>) knew the
family couldn't afford a doctor. The night of Jenna's funeral, Molly wants to sleep
next to Leroy to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>), but Carrie tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Carrie</b></font>) that boys and girls
aren't allowed to sleep with each other. In sixth grade, Molly develops a crush on a female classmate named Leota B.
Bisland. They become friends, and through Molly's urging, they begin to kiss in the
woods after school every day. When Molly finds out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) family is moving to Florida
to look for work, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and Leota make love before separating. Molly and Leroy's families move to the Fort Lauderdale area, where Carl and Ep
find jobs that split up Molly and Leroy. At school, Molly quickly learns the
differences between the posh, bright-eyed rich students and the poor, who seem
slovenly in spirit as well as in appearance. As the years pass, Molly uses her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
intelligence and sense of humor to become popular among the wealthier children,
while Leroy becomes more like a redneck. Tension develops between them, but they try
to remain close. Molly has her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) first heterosexual experience with Leroy after he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>)
tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) one day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leroy</b></font>)'s had repeated sexual experiences with an older man named
Craig. By the time Molly is a high-school upperclassman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and Leroy have grown
apart and do not have sex anymore. Molly belongs to the ruling clique at school,
complete with social club membership and football-player boyfriend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) also obtains
financial support from the school administration for a successful bid as class
president after catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) principal in an adulterous affair with another teacher.
The only snag in Molly's junior year comes from Carrie and Carrie's sister,
Florence, who frequently criticize Molly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arrogance, obstinacy, and apparent
lack of feeling when Carl dies. Though their unjustified antagonism upsets her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
Molly remains unapologetic about how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lives her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) life. When Molly is a senior, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has an affair with Carolyn, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) two best
friends and captain of the cheerleading squad. Carolyn becomes so enraptured with
Molly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) becomes jealous when Molly spends time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) other best friend,
Connie. Carolyn accuses Molly of sleeping with Connie, which Connie overhears,
forcing Molly to explain to Connie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and Carolyn have been lovers. Connie
says she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) can no longer be Molly's friend, and Carolyn, upset with being called a
lesbian, says Molly is the real lesbian because she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) isn't feminine. The girls stop
talking to each other. The following fall, Molly attends the University of Florida on a full
scholarship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) befriends her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) roommate, Faye Raider, a rich freshman who wants only
to drink and carouse. When they begin an affair midway through the first semester,
they ignore their social obligations in favor of spending time together in bed.
Other girls notice and tell the dean of female students, Dean Marne. Dean Marne
offers to help Molly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) problem, but Molly accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) of hypocrisy and calls
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a closet fairy. Angered by Molly's insolence and concerned about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
reputation, Dean Marne commits Molly to a sanitarium for a few days. When Molly
emerges, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gets a letter revoking her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) scholarship for <div class="bookquote">``moral''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>reasons and finds
Faye gone from school. Unable to stay in school and unwelcome in Carrie's house, Molly hitches a ride
to New York City, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) believes she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) can make a better life for herself.
Penniless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spends her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) first nights in an abandoned car with Calvin, a young
black man who fled from his (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) parents because they found out he (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) is gay. Calvin
introduces Molly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) friends, shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) can get free meals, helps her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
make money, and brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to a lesbian bar. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Calvin</b></font>) leaves abruptly for San
Francisco, Molly finds a ramshackle apartment in the West Village and a waitress job
at the Flick, a burger joint where the waitresses dress like
Playboy bunnies. There, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) meets Holly, a voluptuous black
lesbian. Before meeting Holly, Molly unhappily fritters away her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) days at the Flick and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) nights at truck-driver-filled lesbian bars where butch lesbians accost her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for
easy sex. But with Holly, Molly begins to see the more glamorous side of lesbian New
York. Holly is a <div class="bookquote">``kept''  (<font color='red'><b>Holly</b></font>)</div>woman, receiving an allowance to be another woman's lover.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) encourages Molly to do the same and brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to a party to meet Chryssa Hart,
an eminent lesbian archaeologist. Chryssa offers to support Molly in exchange for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sexual companionship, but Molly refuses, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could use the
money to enroll in film school--her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) great passion. Instead, Molly labors to win a
scholarship from New York University and works nights to pay the rest. This decision
causes tension between Holly and Molly, and they argue the night Holly gets both
herself and Molly fired from the Flick. Unable to reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) insecurity about the
shallow life she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) leads with Molly's industriousness, Holly leaves Molly. Molly finds a job at Silver Publishing Company, reducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) class load to
work during the day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is promoted to the editorial staff and meets Polina
Bellantoni, a lovely middle-aged professor writing a book about the Middle Ages.
Molly immediately determines to have a relationship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), but Polina has a
husband, daughter, and male lover, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is uncomfortable with Molly's sexuality.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eventually relents, eager to explore her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bisexual side, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sexual fantasies
of being a man repulse Molly. Trapped in a relationship with Polina, Molly begins an
affair with Polina's teenage daughter, Alice. Alice and Molly keep their tryst a
secret until one day, in a tantrum, Alice tells Polina she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and Molly are lovers.
Polina sends Molly away, forbidding Alice to fraternize with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Demoralized by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) experiences in New York, Molly escapes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hometown in
Pennsylvania. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) meets Leota again, who now has two children and looks unnaturally
aged. Leota is harsh with Molly about their shared sexual experience and thinks
Molly is mentally disturbed for being a lesbian. Molly leaves Leota and never sees
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) again. Back in New York, Molly decides to journey to Florida to film Carrie for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
senior project, a documentary on Carrie's life. Carrie is now completely alone and
dying of cancer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is overjoyed to see Molly, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) still disapproves of
Molly's sexuality. Carrie lets herself be filmed for a week, all that time telling
Molly her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thoughts, feelings, and dreams. Now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thinks of Molly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) daughter
and denies ever having said Molly is not hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tells Molly about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) biological
mother, Ruby, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) biological father, a French athlete from whom Molly seems to
have received all of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) physical traits. Molly leaves at the end of the week,
having shot all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) footage and made peace with Carrie. Molly's film does not impress her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) class, and the entire department is against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s a woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) graduates summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa but has
trouble finding a job in the movie industry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knows that many forces will prevent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) from fulfilling her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dreams of making films, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) resolves to continue
striving.
