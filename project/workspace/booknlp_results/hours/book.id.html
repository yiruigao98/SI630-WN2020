one day in their lives. One of the narrative strands explores the
day in 1923 when Virginia Woolf begins to write Mrs. Dalloway.
Another centers around a day in the life of Laura Brown, an American
housewife, in 1949, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) spends part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) time reading Mrs.
Dalloway. The third narrative takes place on a day in the
late twentieth century, in which Clarissa Vaughn hosts a party for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) poet-friend Richard. The chapters alternate with rough regularity
between these three main characters. The prologue details the suicide of Virginia Woolf. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>)
leaves notes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) husband and sister, then walks to a nearby
river. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) selects a large stone from the bank, places it her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) pocket,
and wades into the water. The next group of chapters retells the early mornings
of the three main characters. Clarissa Vaughn leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) New York
apartment to buy flowers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) is hosting a party that evening in
honor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) best friend Richard, a poet and novelist dying of AIDS,
who is receiving a prestigious literary award for his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) life's work.
As she (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) walks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) bumps into her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) old friend Walter Hardy and catches
a glimpse of a movie star peeking outside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) trailer. The story turns to Virginia Woolf on a morning nearly
twenty years before she (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) commits suicide. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) wakes up thinking about
how to begin her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) new novel, which will detail a day in the life
of a woman named Clarissa Dalloway. Virginia greets her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) husband
as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) corrects proofs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) skips breakfast to avoid dealing
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) temperamental cook. After returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) settles
in to write. The attention turns to Laura Brown, a mother living in
Los Angeles after World War II as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) lies in bed reading Mrs.
Dalloway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) does not have the energy to go downstairs
and say <div class="bookquote">``happy birthday''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) husband, Dan, or to make breakfast
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) young son, Richie. After reading for an hour or two, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>)
finally goes downstairs. Dan leaves for work and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) is alone with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) son. In what is now late morning, Clarissa Vaughn stands on
the street outside the flower shop trying to catch sight of the
movie star who came out of the trailer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) gives up and continues
walking, passing the corner where she (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) and Richard broke up many
years ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) visits Richard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) messy apartment, brightening
the kitchen with fresh flowers as she (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) asks about his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) health. They
must go uptown that night to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) prize and then go to the
party, but despite Clarissa's reassurances, Richard protests that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) does not deserve the prize. Virginia Woolf feels the first strains of a crippling
headache and sets down her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) pen after writing for two hours. Because
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) health, Leonard has moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) from London to the suburbs,
even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) desperately wants to return to the city. Virginia
finds Leonard in the printing room chastising his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) assistant, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) smoothes over the argument. Laura Brown bakes a birthday cake
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) son's help, deciding that the cake must be a perfect work
of art. Before lunch, Virginia takes a walk and thinks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
character Clarissa Dalloway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) decides that Clarissa will have
once been in love with a woman and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) will kill herself. Upon
returning to the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) speaks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) cook, who has become angry
with Virginia for not organizing lunch. The situation worsens when
the cook finds out that Virginia's sister Vanessa will be bringing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vanessa</b></font>) family for tea that afternoon, and the cook must commute to
London to pick up special ingredients. Clarissa Vaughn bumps into her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) live-in lover Sally on
the way back to their apartment. Sally plans to have lunch with
a movie-star friend of hers. As Clarissa puts flowers into water,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) thinks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) disappointment over not getting an invitation
to this lunch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) feels alienated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) own house and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) life,
and reminisces about the happy summer she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) spent with Richard in
Wellfleet when they were still romantically involved. Clarissa thinks
that summer may have been the only perfect time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) life. Laura
Brown finishes the cake and feels disappointed that it does not
attain the standard of perfection she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had hoped for. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) neighbor
Kitty stops by to tell Laura that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) must enter the hospital for
tests on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) uterus. The two women embrace and kiss momentarily,
an experience that moves Laura. After lunch, Vanessa Bell surprises her (<font color='blue'><b>Vanessa</b></font>) sister Virginia
by arriving early for tea. Vanessa's three children find a dying
bird in the garden and make a grass bed for the bird with Virginia's
help. Clarissa Vaughn receives a visit from her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) old friend Louis
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) apartment. A former lover of Richard's who lived with them
at Wellfleet, Louis now teaches in San Francisco and has begun an
affair with a young student. As they talk, Clarissa's rebellious
daughter Julia shows up at the apartment, and Louis leaves. Laura
Brown has thrown away the first cake and baked another. Bored, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
feels the need to escape and leaves Richie at a neighbor's house.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) checks into a hotel to read Mrs. Dalloway for
two hours, thinking about the concept of suicide and deciding that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) could never kill herself. In the mid-afternoon, Vanessa and Virginia sit in the
kitchen drinking tea. Virginia feels happy and decides that Clarissa
Dalloway will not commit suicide after all. Nelly storms in from
London, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) turns her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) back, Virginia leans in and kisses
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) sister on the lips. Meanwhile, Clarissa chats with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) daughter,
Julia, who has brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) difficult friend Mary Krull to the apartment.
Clarissa clashes with Mary, who finally leaves to go shopping with
Julia. Virginia Woolf feels depressed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister leaves
and attempts to write but decides to take a walk to clear her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) head.
After passing the dead bird in the garden, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) wanders to the train
station, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) contemplates taking a train to London. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
waits, Leonard shows up and brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) back to the house. The story
turns to Clarissa's lover, Sally, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) eats lunch with Walter
Hardy and Oliver St. Ives, the movie star. After lunch, Sally shops
with Walter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) buys a gift for his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) lover, which prompts Sally
to stop and buy roses for Clarissa on the way home. Before dinner, Laura drives back to the babysitter's house
to pick up her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) son. Clarissa Vaughn goes over to Richard's apartment
to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) up for the party to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) sitting on the windowsill.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) and jumps out of the window to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) death. Laura
Brown watches her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) son eat the cake that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) has
made and thinks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) dissatisfaction with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) picture-perfect
life. The last group of chapters follows the women as they prepare
for bed. Virginia Woolf has convinced Leonard to move back to London.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) thinks of the kiss she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) shared with Vanessa and decides that Clarissa
Dalloway will have shared a similar kiss with a lover when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) was
young. After some thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalloway</b></font>) decides that Clarissa will not commit
suicide, but that someone insane and sensitive will do so instead.
Laura Brown gazes into the mirror as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) brushes her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) teeth. Detached
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) body, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) thinks about the fact that Dan will want to have
sex with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>). In the final chapter, an older Laura comes to stay
at Clarissa's apartment in the wake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) son Richard's death.
After they speak, Clarissa reflects on the meaning of the passage
of time.
