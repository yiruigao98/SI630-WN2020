Gunther briefly sketches Johnny's life: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) lived in Vienna and London when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) was young; attended Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts; and died in 1947 at the age of seventeen, after a fifteen-month-long illness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) describes Johnny's adolescent but handsome appearance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) amiable nature, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) tremendous willpower, and, above all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) selflessness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) notes Johnny's varied interests, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) incredible intelligence, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) passion for science. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) also mentions his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) ex-wife, Frances, with whom Johnny is very close. Johnny returns home for Spring break and has a good time. The family doctor, Traeger, says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Traeger</b></font>)'s fine. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Traeger</b></font>) does have a slightly stiff neck. At school, they believe Johnny has a brain tumor, so they bring in a specialist, Tracy Putnam. Gunther and Frances drive to Deerfield, and when Gunther sees the face of one of the doctors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) immediately knows that Johnny will die. Johnny endures a painful spinal tap and is sent by ambulance to Columbia- Presbyterian Hospital in New York. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) manages to stay upbeat and intellectual about his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) worsening condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) first operation on April 29, which takes six hours. Johnny's tumor is in a difficult spot for extrication. The operation removes half of the orange-sized tumor. Johnny makes a fast recovery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is walking within two weeks and exhibiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) normal curious intellect. On May 28, Johnny faints and gets worse. Gunther finds out the tumor is undergoing glioblastomatous transformation, a far worse condition that carries the possibilities of blindness, paralysis, and the inevitability of death. Johnny is discharged from the hospital on June 1, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) continues going every day for x-rays until June 20, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) returns home to Connecticut. His (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) physical activity is restricted, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) busies himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) science workshop in the garage and with visits from friends and relatives. Johnny develops papilledema, a protrusion that damages the optic nerve and loses a great deal of peripheral vision. The bump on his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) head opens and leaks pus. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is taken to Wilder Penfield, a renowned surgeon. Penfield tells Gunther that the tumor will kill Johnny. Frances reads a newspaper article about how an experimental method of intravenous dosages of mustard gas, which is commonly poisonous, can improve tumors. Memorial Hospital in New York administers its first injection of mustard gas to Johnny. The mustard produces bad side effects, but it helps Johnny at first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) returns to the country and devotes himself to making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) lost schoolwork and other activities. On August 31, another leak develops. Gunther learns of Max Gerson, a doctor whose unorthodox methods of treating illnesses are based on a controversial diet. With nothing to lose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) and Frances decide to put Johnny on the diet. On September 7, they drive to Gerson's nursing home. At Gerson's nursing home, Johnny starts feeling better. Traeger agrees to continue with Gerson's methods, which include rest, daily enemas, and a salt- free, fat-free diet. Johnny gets much better, and Gunther is confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) will fully recover. Frances keeps Johnny in high spirits, reading to him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) and bringing gifts. Johnny's bump worsens, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) develops a second bump. When Gunther tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) cannot return to school, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) furiously makes up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) lost time through tutoring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) writes a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) headmaster, asking for a reprieve from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) unfinished work and another letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) math teacher, asking to take an important algebra exam. Johnny worsens, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) doctors are amazed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is still alive. They fight about whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) should undergo more drainage. Gunther and Frances decide on a compromise, which includes surgery while keeping with the Gerson diet. Johnny heads off to the Neurological Hospital for five weeks. Dr. Mount makes a highly successful emergency drainage. Johnny's recovery is strengthened, the bump disappears, and everyone believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) will be back to normal within a year, especially when they find out the pus from his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) bump was sterile, indicating that the tumor is dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) returns home on February 6 for the first time since August. In early February 1947, Johnny is physically stronger. By late February, however, the bump grows again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) exhibits the first of a series of short-term amnesia attacks on Feb. 19. Johnny wants to get off the Gerson diet and return to Deerfield, but both requests are denied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) works hard to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) schoolwork in preparation for Harvard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) enrolls and excels in a tutoring school. On April 12, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) college boards. Gunther finishes the book he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) was writing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) takes Johnny to Neurological Hospital for an exam. Mount takes some fluid as a sample but is only able to extract very little from the stone-sized, rigid structure. Gunther is told Johnny has glioma multiforme, one of the worst forms of tumor, and it is rapidly worsening. Penfield urges Gunther to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) undergo a drastic second operation to try and clear out the tumor. They decide to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) off the Gerson diet. On May 1, Mount extracts <div class="bookquote">``two handfuls''  (<font color='red'><b>Johnny</b></font>)</div>from the tumor, but the tumor is still huge. Johnny's bulge disappears and is replaced by a long-awaited concavity. On May 15, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is checked out of Neurological Hospital. On May 25, Mr. Boydon, the headmaster of Deerfield, calls and announces Johnny will receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) diploma because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) extra credits. They drive to Deerfield. Johnny attends all the graduation events and, on June 4, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) marches to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) diploma despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) ill health. They repeat Johnny's earlier treatment--mustard gas, x-ray, Gerson diet, and possibly another operation, in that order of increasing intensity. On June 12, Johnny is sent back to Memorial Hospital. On June 27, Johnny suffers a worse attack of amnesia and the shivers. Johnny maintains his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) drive for Harvard, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) has difficulty feeding himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) shiver attacks seem permanent. Frances visits on a Sunday, and on this day, Johnny regains his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) energy, enjoying a wonderful day with both parents. The next day, June 30, Johnny is fatigued. Gunther takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) to Memorial Hospital for a last test before he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) heads to the country. At home, Johnny has a bad headache, and morphine is sent to the house after he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) vomits a caffeine pill. Johnny grows hazier and Gunther calls Traeger to come over. Traeger tells Gunther that Johnny is dying from a cerebral hemorrhage. After several complications, they transport him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) to a nearby hospital. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) is given extensive medical attention, but it is not enough. Johnny goes to sleep and never wakes, dying at 11:02 P.M. Gunther transcribes the letters Johnny wrote in his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) life from age seven until near his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) death. Johnny's early letters display his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) sensitive, loving side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) fascination with science and a variety of hobbies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) would take with him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) last letter, to Frances, includes a scribbled note: <div class="bookquote">``Scientists will save us all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Frances</b></font>)</div>Gunther also transcribes a diary that Johnny kept over the last few years; Johnny took the notebook with him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) was while sick. Since Johnny left the diary conspicuously in the open, Gunther and Frances believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) was using it indirectly to communicate to them thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) did not want to discuss. One entry lists the five-part <div class="bookquote">``Gunther philosophy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Confucian</b></font>)</div>which includes rules and reminders like the Confucian Golden Rule -LRB-do unto others as they would do unto you-RRB- and <div class="bookquote">``No immortality.''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) post-tumor entries rarely touch upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) condition, but they continue with philosophical ruminations and directions, academic reports, and day-to-day news, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) occasionally exposes his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunther</b></font>) fears and turbulent emotions. Frances narrates the final section. She (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) brings up all the questions about life that death raises, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) discussed with Johnny throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) illness; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) was not merely dying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) was re-born each day. The only answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) can muster to all the philosophical questions is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) wishes they had loved Johnny more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) wants to tell other parents to embrace their children, who are alive, not dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) resolves again that the aim of life is to love, to eradicate hate, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) hopes to love Johnny more and more until she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) dies--as that kind of love is a <div class="bookquote">``love of love, the love of life.''
