Through twelve chapters, each marked as a <div class="bookquote">``monthly installment''  (<font color='red'><b>Tita/Tita De La Garza</b></font>)</div>and thus labeled with the months of the year, we learn of Tita's struggle to pursue true love and claim her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) independence. Each installment features a recipe to begin each chapter. The structure of Like Water For Chocolate is wholly dependent on these recipes, as the main episodes of each chapter generally involve the preparation or consumption of the dishes that these recipes yield. The details of additional secondary recipes are woven throughout the narrative. Like Water For Chocolate tells the story of Tita De La Garza, the youngest daughter in a family living in Mexico at the turn of the twentieth century. Tita's love, Pedro Muzquiz, comes to the family's ranch to ask for Tita's hand in marriage. Because Tita is the youngest daughter she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is forbidden by a family tradition upheld by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tyrannical mother, Mama Elena, to marry. Pedro marries Tita's oldest sister, Rosaura, instead, but declares to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) father that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) has only married Rosaura to remain close to Tita. Rosaura and Pedro live on the family ranch, offering Pedro contact with Tita. When Tita cooks a special meal with the petals of a rose given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosaura</b></font>) by Pedro, the still-fiery force of their love -LRB-transmitted through the food-RRB- has an intense effect on Mama Elena's second daughter, Gertrudis, who is whipped into a lustful state and flees the ranch in the arms of a revolutionary soldier. Meanwhile, Rosaura gives birth to a son, who is delivered by Tita. Tita treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosaura</b></font>) nephew, Roberto, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roberto</b></font>) were her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosaura</b></font>) own child, to the point that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosaura</b></font>) is able to produce breast milk to feed him (<font color='blue'><b>Roberto</b></font>) while her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosaura</b></font>) sister is dry. Sensing that Roberto is drawing Pedro and Tita closer together, Mama Elena arranges for Rosaura's family to move to San Antonio. This separation devastates Tita. A short time later, news arrives that Roberto has died, most likely due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roberto</b></font>) removal from Tita's care. The death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) nephew causes Tita to have a breakdown, and Mama Elena sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) to an asylum. Dr. John Brown, a local American doctor, takes pity on Tita and brings her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) to live in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) patiently nurses Tita back to health, caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) physical ailments and trying to revive her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) broken spirit. After some time, Tita is nearly well, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) decides never to return to the ranch. No sooner has she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) made this choice than Mama Elena is injured in a raid by rebel soldiers, forcing Tita to return. Tita hopes to care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) mother, but Mama Elena bitterly rejects Tita's good will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) refuses Tita's cooking, claiming that it is poisoned. Not long after, Mama Elena is found dead from an overdose of a strong emetic she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) consumed for fear of poisoning. The death of Mama Elena frees Tita from the curse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) birthright and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) accepts an engagement proposal from John Brown, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) has fallen in love. In the meantime, Rosaura and Pedro have returned to the ranch and have produced a second child, Esperanza. Immediately, Pedro's presence throws into question Tita's love for John. The night that John officially asks Pedro to bless the marriage, Pedro corners Tita in a hidden room and makes love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>), taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) virginity. Soon after, Tita is certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) is pregnant and knows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) will have to end her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) engagement to John. The affair between Pedro and Tita prompts the return of Mama Elena, who comes in spirit form to curse Tita and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) unborn child. Tita is distraught and has no one in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) can confide. In the midst of Tita's despair, the long-lost Gertrudis returns to the ranch as a general in the revolutionary army, at the helm of a regiment of fifty men. Tita is overjoyed at the return of Gertrudis, who is just the companion she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) seeks. Gertrudis forces Tita to tell Pedro about the pregnancy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) is gladdened at the news, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) drunkenly serenades Tita from below her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) window. Outraged, Mama Elena's ghost returns, violently threatening Tita and declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) must leave the ranch. For the first time, Tita stands up to Mama Elena and, in forceful words, declares her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) autonomy, banishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) mother's spirit, which shrinks from an imposing presence into a tiny fiery light. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) expels the ghost, Tita is simultaneously relieved of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) symptoms of pregnancy. The light from Mama Elena's ghost bursts through Tita's window and onto the patio below where Pedro still sits, setting fire to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) entire body. After rescuing Pedro, Tita is consumed with caring for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) and helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) recover. John Brown returns from a trip to the United States and Tita confesses to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) relations with Pedro. John replies that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) still wishes to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) must decide for herself with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) wishes to spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) life. Years pass, and the ranch focuses its attention on another wedding, this time between Esperanza and Alex, the son of John Brown. Rosaura has died, freeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosaura</b></font>) only daughter, Esperanza, from the stricture that had previously forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>), as it had Tita, from marrying. With Rosaura dead and Esperanza married, Tita and Pedro are finally free to express their love in the open. On their first night together, Tita and Pedro experience love so intense that both are led to a tunnel that will carry them to the afterlife. Tita turns back, wanting to continue in life and in love with Pedro. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) does, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) realizes that Pedro has already crossed over. Wanting desperately to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>), Tita attempts to ignite her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) inner fire by eating the candles that had lit the room until they extinguished themselves at the moment of Pedro's death. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) succeeds in recreating the climate of true passion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) reenters the luminous tunnel and meets Pedro in the spirit world. The final union of their bodies and spirits sets fire to the entire ranch, and the only remnant left of their love is the recipe book in which Tita recorded her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) wisdom.
