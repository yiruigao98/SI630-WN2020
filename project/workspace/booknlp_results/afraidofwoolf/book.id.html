It opens with the main characters, George and Martha coming home from a party at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) father's house. The two of them clearly care deeply for each other, but events have turned their marriage into a nasty battle between two disenchanted, cynical enemies. Even though the pair arrives home at two o'clock in the morning, they are expecting guests: the new math professor and his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) wife. Of course, as it turns out, this new, young professor, Nick, actually works in the biology department. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) wife, Honey, walk into a brutal social situation. In the first act, <div class="bookquote">``Fun and Games,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>Martha and George try to fight and humiliate each other in new, inventive ways. As they peel away each other's pretenses and self-respect, George and Martha use Honey and Nick as pawns, transforming their guests into an audience to witness humiliation, into levers for creating jealousy, and into a means for expressing their own sides of their mutual story. In the second act, <div class="bookquote">``Walpurgisnacht,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>these games get even nastier. The evening turns into a nightmare. George and Martha even attack Honey and Nick, attempting to force them to reveal their dirty secrets and true selves. Finally, in the last act, <div class="bookquote">``The Exorcism,''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>everyone's secrets have been revealed and purged. Honey and Nick go home, leaving Martha and George to try to rebuild their shattered marriage.
