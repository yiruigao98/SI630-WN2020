uneducated, twenty-year-old black man in 1930s
Chicago, wakes up one morning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family's cramped apartment
on the South Side of the city. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sees a huge rat scamper across
the room, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) corners and kills with a skillet. Having grown
up under the climate of harsh racial prejudice in 1930s
America, Bigger is burdened with a powerful conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) has
no control over his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) life and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) cannot aspire to anything other
than menial, low-wage labor. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mother pesters him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to take a job
with a rich white man named Mr. Dalton, but Bigger instead chooses
to meet up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>) friends to plan the robbery of a white man's
store. Anger, fear, and frustration define Bigger's daily existence,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>) is forced to hide behind a fa√ßade of toughness or risk succumbing
to despair. While Bigger and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>) gang have robbed many black-owned businesses,
they have never attempted to rob a white man. Bigger sees
whites not as individuals, but as a natural, oppressive force--a great
looming <div class="bookquote">``whiteness''  (<font color='red'><b>individuals</b></font>)</div>pressing down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Bigger's fear of confronting
this force overwhelms him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but rather than admit his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fear, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) violently
attacks a member of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gang to sabotage the robbery. Left with
no other options, Bigger takes a job as a chauffeur for the Daltons. Coincidentally, Mr. Dalton is also Bigger's landlord,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>) owns a controlling share of the company that manages the apartment
building where Bigger's family lives. Mr. Dalton and other wealthy
real estate barons are effectively robbing the poor, black tenants
on Chicago's South Side--they refuse to allow blacks to rent apartments
in predominantly white neighborhoods, thus leading to overpopulation
and artificially high rents in the predominantly black South Side.
Mr. Dalton sees himself as a benevolent philanthropist, however,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>) donates money to black schools and offers jobs to <div class="bookquote">``poor, timid
black boys''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>like Bigger. However, Mr. Dalton practices this token
philanthropy mainly to alleviate his (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>) guilty conscience for exploiting
poor blacks. Mary, Mr. Dalton's daughter, frightens and angers Bigger
by ignoring the social taboos that govern the relations between
white women and black men. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>) first day of work, Bigger drives
Mary to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) communist boyfriend, Jan.. Eager to prove their
progressive ideals and racial tolerance, Mary and Jan force Bigger
to take them to a restaurant in the South Side. Despite Bigger's
embarrassment, they order drinks, and as the evening passes, all
three of them get drunk. Bigger then drives around the city while
Mary and Jan make out in the back seat. Afterward, Mary is too drunk
to make it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bedroom on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own, so Bigger helps her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up the
stairs. Drunk and aroused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) unprecedented proximity to a young
white woman, Bigger begins to kiss Mary. Just as Bigger places Mary on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bed, Mary's blind mother,
Mrs. Dalton, enters the bedroom. Though Mrs. Dalton cannot see him (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>)
ghostlike presence terrifies him (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>). Bigger worries that Mary, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) drunken
condition, will reveal his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) presence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) covers her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face with a pillow
and accidentally smothers her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to death. Unaware that Mary has been
killed, Mrs. Dalton prays over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalton</b></font>) daughter and returns to bed.
Bigger tries to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) crime by burning Mary's body in the Daltons'
furnace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) decides to try to use the Daltons' prejudice against
communists to frame Jan for Mary's disappearance. Bigger believes
that the Daltons will assume Jan is dangerous and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) may have
kidnapped their daughter for political purposes. Additionally, Bigger
takes advantage of the Daltons' racial prejudices to avoid suspicion,
continuing to play the role of a timid, ignorant black servant who
would be unable to commit such an act. Mary's murder gives Bigger a sense of power and identity
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) has never known. Bigger's girlfriend, Bessie, makes an offhand
comment that inspires him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to try to collect ransom money from the
Daltons. They know only that Mary has vanished, not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is
dead. Bigger writes a ransom letter, playing upon the Daltons' hatred
of communists by signing his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) name <div class="bookquote">``Red.''  (<font color='red'><b>communists</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) then bullies Bessie
to take part in the ransom scheme. However, Mary's bones are found in
the furnace, and Bigger flees with Bessie to an empty building. Bigger
rapes Bessie and, frightened that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) will give him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) away, bludgeons
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) to death with a brick after she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) falls asleep. Bigger eludes the massive manhunt for as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) can,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) is eventually captured after a dramatic shoot-out. The press
and the public determine his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) guilt and his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) punishment before his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
trial even begins. The furious populace assumes that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) raped Mary
before killing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and burned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) body to hide the evidence of the
rape. Moreover, the white authorities and the white mob use Bigger's crime
as an excuse to terrorize the entire South Side . Jan visits Bigger in jail. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) understands
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) terrified, angered, and shamed Bigger through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) violation
of the social taboos that govern tense race relations. Jan enlists
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) friend, Boris A. Max, to defend Bigger free of charge. Jan and
Max speak with Bigger as a human being, and Bigger begins to see
whites as individuals and himself as their equal. Max tries to save Bigger from the death penalty, arguing
that while his (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) client is responsible for his (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) crime, it is vital
to recognize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) is a product of his (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) environment. Part of the
blame for Bigger's crimes belongs to the fearful, hopeless existence
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) has experienced in a racist society since birth. Max warns
that there will be more men like Bigger if America does not put
an end to the vicious cycle of hatred and vengeance. Despite Max's
arguments, Bigger is sentenced to death. Bigger is not a traditional hero by any means. However,
Wright forces us to enter into Bigger's mind and to understand the
devastating effects of the social conditions in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wright</b></font>) was raised.
Bigger was not born a violent criminal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wright</b></font>) is a <div class="bookquote">``native son'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>: a
product of American culture and the violence and racism that suffuse
it.
