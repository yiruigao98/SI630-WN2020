Morgenstern-RRB-, and its relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morgenstern</b></font>) own childhood and adulthood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morgenstern</b></font>) proclaims that it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Morgenstern</b></font>) favorite book and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morgenstern</b></font>) has edited out the <div class="bookquote">``good parts,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the action stories that his (<font color='blue'><b>Morgenstern</b></font>) father read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgenstern</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morgenstern</b></font>) was ten and in bed with pneumonia. The story proper begins with Buttercup, one of the world's twenty most beautiful women, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) tomboyish life on a farm with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) parents, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) horse, and Westley, their farm-boy. One afternoon a band of Florinese royalty appear on the farm, and while Buttercup watches a well-dressed Countess watch Westley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) falls suddenly, madly, jealously in love with this man she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) has known all her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) professes her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) love to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaves immediately to America to seek his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune, and soon is reported to have been murdered by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup is broken, and vows never to love again. The next three chapters are short and deal primarily with the wedding preparations of Prince Humperdinck. We learn that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) loves to hunt, is quite good at it, and spends the majority of time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) Zoo of Death -LRB-the original <div class="bookquote">``Pit of Despair'' (<font color='red'><b>the majority</b></font>)</div>-RRB- hunting the vile and dangerous animals he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) has collected there. His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) father, King Lotharon, is old and dying, and Prince Humperdinck must marry to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) place as Florin's king. After an unfortunate occurrence with the princess of Guilder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is led to Buttercup by his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) confidante, Count Rugen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) demands her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hand in marriage. In Chapter Five, Buttercup is kidnapped by a criminal band consisting of Vizzini, Fezzik, and Inigo. Followed closely by a mysterious black boat, they sail with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to the cliffs on the coast of Guilder. On the coast, each of the men is defeated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) strength by their pursuer, the man in black, and while Inigo and Fezzik, after a sword-fight and wrestling match, respectively, are left unconscious but alive, Vizzini is killed in a battle of wits. The man in black runs with Buttercup along the Guilder terrain, and soon is revealed to be the long-lost Westley. The lovers reunite and, in an attempt to avoid capture by Prince Humperdinck and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) men, Buttercup and Westley travel through the Fireswamp, an eerie and dangerous place. We find out here that Westley is the pirate that everybody had assumed had killed Westley. Upon exiting the swamp, they encounter Humperdinck anyway, and Buttercup agrees to return with the prince to Florin as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Florin</b></font>) promises to return Westley safely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>) ship. The lovers are separated again. Chapter Six follows each of the main characters in their plans leading up to the wedding between Buttercup and Humperdinck. Inigo and Fezzik reunite in the Florin Thieves Quarters and set out to find the man in black. The man in black -LRB-Westley-RRB- is currently being tortured in the Zoo of Death by Humperdinck and Count Rugen. Buttercup is having nightmares and pining away for Westley, who in turn is still pining away for her (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>). Humperdinck is planning to murder Buttercup on their wedding night in order to frame Guilder and begin a war. Everybody is harried and busy as the wedding approaches. Humperdinck reassures Buttercup that he (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>) has sent out his (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>) four fastest ships to find Westley, Buttercup realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>) is lying and calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>) a weakling, and Humperdinck us terribly offended by this and rages off to the Zoo of Death to kill Westley on the torture machine. Inigo and Fezzik hear Westley's scream and follow it to the Zoo of Death. Chapter Seven plots Inigo and Fezzik inside the false entrance to the Zoo of Death, where they must pass many ghastly creatures before descending to the fifth level and finding Westley. The highlights of this underground journey are a ravenous snake and King bats, and Fezzik and Inigo respectively save each other's life. On the bottom level, they finally find Westley's corpse, and they drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>) to Miracle Max's house in hope of reviving him (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>). Miracle Max and his (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) wife Valerie are feisty and difficult and reluctant to help, but they are very experienced in miracles, so once they set out to revive Westley, they create a successful miracle pill which does the trick. Inigo and Fezzik administer it to Westley on the top of the castle wall, and Westley comes back to life instantly and concocts a plan for them to enter the castle proper. This plan involves Fezzik being lit on fire and wheeled toward the guards, and it works without a hitch. Chapter Eight follows the final acts of the main characters, first tracing Inigo as he (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>) challenges, chases, is wounded by and ultimately kills Count Rugen. Buttercup is married to Humperdinck, left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rugen</b></font>) chamber where she (<font color='blue'><b>Buttercup</b></font>) plans to kill herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Buttercup</b></font>) sees Westley, alive on the prince's bed. Westley frightens Humperdinck with talk about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>) would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Westley</b></font>) alive but maimed if they were to duel, and the prince allows himself to be tied to a chair by Buttercup. Meanwhile, Fezzik, who has gotten lost on the grounds, appears with the prince's four white horses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>), Inigo, Westley and Buttercup ride away. S. Morganstern ends the book with a series of ominous crises, but William Goldman cuts in and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldman</b></font>) believes that they do escape and live happily, though not perfectly, ever after.
