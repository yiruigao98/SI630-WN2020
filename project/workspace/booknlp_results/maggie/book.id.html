Jimmie is rescued by Pete, a teenager who seems to be a casual acquaintance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmie</b></font>). They encounter Jimmie's offhandedly brutal father, who brings Jimmie home, where we are introduced to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmie</b></font>) timid older sister Maggie and little brother Tommie, and to Mary, the family's drunken, vicious matriarch. The evening that follows seems typical: the father goes to bars to drink himself into oblivion while the mother stays home and rages until she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), too, drops off into a drunken stupor. The children huddle in a corner, terrified. As time passes, both the father and Tommie die. Jimmie hardens into a sneering, aggressive, cynical youth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmie</b></font>) gets a job as a teamster. Maggie, by contrast, seems somehow immune to the corrupting influence of abject poverty; underneath the grime, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is physically beautiful and, even more surprising, both hopeful and na√Øve. When Pete--now a bartender--makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) return to the scene, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) entrances Maggie with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) bravado and show of bourgeois trappings. Pete senses easy prey, and they begin dating; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is taken--and taken in--by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) relative worldliness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) ostentatious displays of confidence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sees in him (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) the promise of wealth and culture, an escape from the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) childhood. There comes a night when the drunk and combative Mary accuses Maggie of going <div class="bookquote">``to deh devil''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie</b></font>)</div>and disgracing the family; Maggie runs into Pete's arms, and we are given to understand that the two are, indeed, sleeping together. Jimmie is furious that Pete has <div class="bookquote">``ruined''  (<font color='red'><b>Pete</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) sister, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) gets very drunk with a friend and gets into a brawl with Pete. After this, Maggie leaves home and goes to live with Pete. Jimmie and Mary affect sorrow and bewilderment at Maggie's fall from grace, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) behavior becomes a neighborhood scandal. A scant few weeks after Maggie leaves home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is in a bar with Pete when they meet Nellie, a scheming woman with a veneer of sophistication who has no trouble convincing Pete to leave Maggie. Abandoned, Maggie tries to return home, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) family rejects her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). The linear narrative now ceases, and we are given a series of scenes, arranged in chronological order but separated by passages of time. There is an interlude in which we see that Jimmie, who acts horrified at Maggie's actions, has in fact himself seduced and then abandoned at least one girl. In another brief scene, Maggie visits Pete at work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>), too, refuses to acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) legitimate claims on him (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>). Months later, we are shown a prostitute--presumably Maggie, but unnamed--walking the streets of New York, pathetic and rejected, bound for trouble. There is a scene with Pete in a bar, badly drunk and surrounded by women; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) collapses on the floor and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) turn, is abandoned by the scornful and manipulative Nellie. Finally, the novel ends with Jimmie giving Mary the news that Maggie's dead body has been found. Mary stages a scene of melodramatic mourning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ruined child, which ends with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) deeply hypocritical and bitterly ironic concession: <div class="bookquote">``I'll fergive her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)!''
