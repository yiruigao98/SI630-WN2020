Union regiment rests along a riverbank, where it has been camped
for weeks. A tall soldier named Jim Conklin spreads a rumor that
the army will soon march. Henry Fleming, a recent recruit with this 304th
Regiment, worries about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fleming</b></font>) courage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fleming</b></font>) fears that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fleming</b></font>) were to
see battle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fleming</b></font>) might run. The narrator reveals that Henry joined
the army because he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was drawn to the glory of military conflict.
Since the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) joined, however, the army has merely been waiting
for engagement. At last the regiment is given orders to march, and the
soldiers spend several weary days traveling on foot. Eventually
they approach a battlefield and begin to hear the distant roar of
conflict. After securing its position, the enemy charges. Henry,
boxed in by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fellow soldiers, realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could not run
even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wanted to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fires mechanically, feeling like a cog
in a machine. The blue -LRB-Union-RRB- regiment defeats the gray -LRB-Confederate-RRB-
soldiers, and the victors congratulate one another. Henry wakes
from a brief nap to find that the enemy is again charging his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) regiment.
Terror overtakes him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) this time and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) leaps up and flees the
line. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) scampers across the landscape, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tells himself that
made the right decision, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) regiment could not have won, and
that the men who remained to fight were fools. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) passes a general
on horseback and overhears the commander saying that the regiment
has held back the enemy charge. Ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cowardice, Henry
tries to convince himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was right to preserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own
life to do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wanders through a forest glade in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) encounters the
decaying corpse of a soldier. Shaken, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hurries away. After a time, Henry joins a column of wounded soldiers
winding down the road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is deeply envious of these men, thinking
that a wound is like <div class="bookquote">``a red badge of courage'' (<font color='red'><b>these men</b></font>)</div>--visible proof of
valorous behavior. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) meets a tattered man who has been shot twice
and who speaks proudly of the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) regiment did not flee.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) repeatedly asks Henry where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is wounded, which makes Henry
deeply uncomfortable and compels him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to hurry away to a different
part of the column. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) meets a spectral soldier with a distant,
numb look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) face. Henry eventually recognizes the man as a
badly wounded Jim Conklin. Henry promises to take care of Jim, but
Jim runs from the line into a small grove of bushes where Henry
and the tattered man watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) die. Henry and the tattered soldier wander through the woods. Henry
hears the rumble of combat in the distance. The tattered soldier
continues to ask Henry about his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wound, even as his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own health visibly
worsens. At last, Henry is unable to bear the tattered man's questioning
and abandons him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to die in the forest. Henry continues to wander until he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) finds himself close
enough to the battlefield to be able to watch some of the fighting.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sees a blue regiment in retreat and attempts to stop the soldiers
to find out what has happened. One of the fleeing men hits him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) on
the head with a rifle, opening a bloody gash on Henry's head. Eventually,
another soldier leads Henry to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) regiment's camp, where Henry
is reunited with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) companions. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) friend Wilson, believing that
Henry has been shot, cares for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tenderly. The next day, the regiment proceeds back to
the battlefield. Henry fights like a lion. Thinking of Jim Conklin,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) vents his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rage against the enemy soldiers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lieutenant says
that with ten thousand Henrys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could win the war in a week. Nevertheless, Henry
and Wilson overhear an officer say that the soldiers of the 304th
fight like <div class="bookquote">``mule drivers.''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldiers</b></font>)</div>Insulted, they long to prove the man
wrong. In an ensuing charge, the regiment's color bearer falls.
Henry takes the flag and carries it proudly before the regiment.
After the charge fails, the derisive officer tells the regiment's
colonel that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) men fight like <div class="bookquote">``mud diggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>further infuriating
Henry. Another soldier tells Henry and Wilson, to their gratification,
that the colonel and lieutenant consider them the best fighters
in the regiment. The group is sent into more fighting, and Henry continues
to carry the flag. The regiment charges a group of enemy soldiers
fortified behind a fence, and, after a pitched battle, wins the
fence. Wilson seizes the enemy flag and the regiment takes four
prisoners. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) and the others march back to their position, Henry
reflects on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) experiences in the war. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) revels in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
recent success in battle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) feels deeply ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) behavior
the previous day, especially his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) abandonment of the tattered man.
But after a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) guilt behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and realizes that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has come through <div class="bookquote">``the red sickness''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of battle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is now able
to look forward to peace, feeling a quiet, steady manhood within
himself.
