Wilcox ends badly, the cultured, idealistic
Schlegel family thinks it they will have nothing
further to do with the materialistic, commerce-obsessed Wilcoxes.  The Schlegels
continue with their
intellectual lives.  At a performance of Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony, they meet an impoverished insurance
clerk named Leonard Bast, who regards them with
general suspicion when Helen accidentally steals his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)
umbrella.  The Schlegels are shocked when the
Wilcoxes move from their country estate of Howards
End to a London flat opposite their home on
Wickham Place in London.  But Paul has left to win
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fortune in Nigeria, and Helen is vacationing with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cousin Frieda in Germany, so there is little
danger of an unpleasant scene.  Margaret, Helen's
older sister and the head of the family, even
befriends Mrs. Wilcox; they go Christmas shopping
together, and Margaret throws a luncheon for the
ethereal, selfless Mrs. Wilcox. When Mrs. Wilcox dies not long afterward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) leaves
a handwritten note behind asking that Howards End be
given to Margaret.  But her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pragmatic husband,
Henry, a prominent businessman, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) greedy
son Charles, a struggling businessman, refuse to
act on the matter and never mention it to Margaret.
One night, Margaret and Helen run into Henry,
and they discuss the case of Leonard Bast; Henry
warns them that Leonard's insurance company is doomed
to failure, and they advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to find a
new job.  But poor Leonard, who associates the
Schlegels with all things cultural and romantic--he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
reads constantly, hoping to better himself--resents
this intrusion into his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) business life and accuses
them of trying to profit from his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) knowledge of the
insurance industry. Margaret and Henry develop a halting, gradual
friendship.  When the lease expires at Wickham Place,
the Schlegels begin looking for another house -LRB-their
landlord wants to follow the general trend and
replace their house with a more profitable apartment
building-RRB-.  Henry offers to rent them a house he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) owns
in London, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shows it to Margaret, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
suddenly proposes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is surprised by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
happiness, and after considering
the proposal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) accepts. Shortly before Margaret and Henry are scheduled to be
married, Henry's daughter Evie marries a man
named Percy Cahill; the wedding is held at a
Wilcox estate near Wales.  After the party, which
Margaret finds quite unpleasant, Helen arrives in a
disheveled state, with the Basts in tow.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
declares indignantly that Leonard has left his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) old
company, found a new job, and been summarily fired;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) is now without an income.  Helen angrily blames
Henry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ill-considered advice.  Margaret asks
Henry to give Leonard a job, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sees Jacky
Bast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had an affair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
10 years ago, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was a prostitute in Cyprus.
Margaret forgives him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) for the indiscretion--it was
before they even met--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) writes to Helen that
there will be no job for Leonard. Helen and the Basts have retired to a hotel in town,
and after Jacky goes to sleep, Helen and Leonard stay
up discussing Helen's philosophical observations
about life.  After Margaret's note arrives, a feeling
of tragedy descends on their conversation, and they
make love--an unwelcome development for both of them:
Leonard is wracked with guilt, and Helen becomes
pregnant.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) leaves for Germany the following
morning, and both she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) and Leonard recede from
Margaret's life.  Margaret and Henry are married, and
plan to build a new home in Sussex. After some time passes, however, Margaret begins to
worry about her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister, and with Henry's help, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
arranges a scheme to surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) at Howards End,
where Helen is going to collect some books.  -LRB-The
Schlegels' belongings are being stored at Howards
End.-RRB-  Here, Margaret sees Helen's advanced
pregnancy, and is filled with love and tenderness for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister.  Helen asks to spend the night with
Margaret at Howards End, but Henry refuses to let a
<div class="bookquote">``fallen woman''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>sleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) home.  When Margaret
points out that Henry himself has committed a worse
sexual indiscretion than Helen, Henry is outraged,
and Margaret resolves to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), returning to
Germany with Helen. In the meantime, Leonard decides to confess
to Margaret what happened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) travels to
Howards End the morning after Margaret and Helen
sleep there.  When he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) arrives, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) is beaten by
Charles Wilcox with the flat of a sword, and a
bookcase falls on him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>).  Leonard has a heart attack
and dies.  After the inquest, Charles is charged with
manslaughter and sentenced to three years in prison.
Henry is shattered, and comes to Margaret for help.
Henry, Margaret, and Helen move into Howards End,
where Helen and Henry learn to be friends and where
Helen's son is born.  Fourteen months later, they are
still living there happily.
