for his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreau</b></font>) childhood home, Nogent-sur-Seine. On the boat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreau</b></font>) sees a
beautiful woman, Madame Arnoux, and instantly falls in love with
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). At home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreau</b></font>) spends time with Charles Deslauriers, his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreau</b></font>) best
friend, who encourages him (<font color='blue'><b>Moreau</b></font>) to befriend Monsieur Arnoux as a way
of getting closer to Madame. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moreau</b></font>) also tells Frédéric to take advantage
of Frédéric's mother's friend Roque, who has connections to a man
in high society, Monsieur Dambreuse. Frédéric returns to Paris to attend law school and visits
the wealthy Dambreuse, a banker. Dambreuse is uninterested in Frédéric.
On his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) way home, Frédéric finds an art shop with Arnoux's name on
it. Frédéric is unhappy in Paris, stops attending classes, and drifts
idly through the city. One day, there are riots in the streets. Frédéric
asks a man named Hussonnet what's happening, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't know.
An innocent-seeming man is arrested, and Frédéric and Hussonnet
follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). In jail, they visit the man, named Dussardier, but cannot
help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Frédéric finds out that Hussonnet works for Arnoux's magazine,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eventually takes Frédéric to Arnoux's house. Frédéric begins
spending more time with Arnoux and the men in Arnoux's social circle,
including Regimbart and Pellerin, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) never sees Madame
Arnoux. Deslauriers visits Paris, but Frédéric is invited to dinner
at the Arnouxes' house and ignores him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>). There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) finally sees Madame Arnoux
and speaks with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) decides to be a painter and recruits Pellerin
to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>). One day, Frédéric, believing that Arnoux is out of
town, tries to visit Madame Arnoux alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) is not there, but
Arnoux is. Frédéric accidentally breaks the handle of a parasol. Months later, Frédéric attends a party for Madame Arnoux's name
day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) a new parasol, apologizing for breaking hers,
but Arnoux angrily pulls him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) away. Arnoux gives Madame Arnoux some
roses, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) throws from the carriage as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>), Arnoux, and Frédéric
go home, an action only Frédéric sees. Frédéric receives a large inheritance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) uncle Barthelemy. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) returns to Paris after visiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) mother, the Arnouxes have
moved and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) must work to find them. Arnoux has become a pottery
dealer. Frédéric vows to stop thinking about Madame Arnoux. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) uses
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) new fortune to buy new clothes, plans to visit the Dambreuses,
and then visits Arnoux instead. Arnoux takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) to a party, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) meets a woman named Rosanette. When Frédéric finally visits the
Dambreuses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) is surprised at the triviality of the people there. Frédéric has a house-warming party. The guests gossip
about politics and a scandal they think Arnoux is involved with.
Deslauriers asks for money to support Hussonnet's political paper,
but Frédéric refuses. Frédéric figures out that Rosanette is Arnoux's mistress,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) tries unsuccessfully to make Rosanette his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) own mistress.
At a party at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) house, Dambreuse suggests he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) might be able to
get Frédéric a job in business. Frédéric becomes close friends with both Arnouxes, earning
their trust. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) tries to break them up. To avoid an argument, Arnoux
tells Madame Arnoux that Rosanette is Frédéric's mistress, which Frédéric
angrily denies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) helps the Arnouxes put off repaying a debt they
owe to the Dambreuses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) visits Arnoux's china factory and is shown
around by Madame Arnoux. Frédéric makes an advance, which Madame
Arnoux rebuffs. Frédéric begins pursuing Rosanette in earnest and takes
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to the races, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) goes home with a man named Cisy. At dinner
one night at Cisy's opulent home, Cisy reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone
home with Rosanette to win a bet. The guests talk about Arnoux and lewdly
suggest that Madame Arnoux has been a mistress to many men. Frédéric
throws a plate at Cisy, and the argument escalates. The men agree
to a duel, but on the appointed day, Cisy faints. Frédéric returns to Nogent to visit Roque's daughter,
Louise, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) is considering marrying. Deslauriers decides to pursue the potential job with Dambreuse as
well as Madame Arnoux, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) is unsuccessful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) tells Madame Arnoux
that Frédéric is getting married. Frédéric returns to Paris to think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) wants to marry
Louise because of Roque's wealth but believes this would prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>)
weakness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) goes to Arnoux's factory to buy two statues for Louise. There,
Madame Arnoux reveals her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) bitterness about his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) impending marriage
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) affair with Rosanette, both of which Frédéric denies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>)
claims he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) and they begin spending more time together,
although not as lovers. Frédéric grows frustrated and tries to get
Madame Arnoux to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) in an apartment he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) has rented expressly
for them. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) child, Eugene, grows ill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) takes it as
a sign to stop spending time with Frédéric. Frédéric takes Rosanette
to the apartment instead, and they become lovers. The monarchy of King Philippe is disintegrating, and the
Republic has triumphed. Dambreuse suggests that Frédéric run for
the National Assembly, but Frédéric's brief attempt ends in failure. Frédéric finds out that Arnoux is still Rosanette's lover.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) tries to get Rosanette to choose between them, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) refuses.
Frédéric takes Rosanette out of Paris, where their relationship
deepens. While there, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) finds out that Dussardier has been wounded
in the fighting in Paris, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) returns there to find him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). Meanwhile, Roque
has come to Paris to join the fighting, and Louise has come too,
hoping to see Frédéric. At a party at the Dambreuses' house, which Roque and Louise attend,
the guests discuss the state of the city. Louise is jealous when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>)
sees Madame Dambreuse flirt with Frédéric, and Madame Arnoux warns
her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) not to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>). Later, Frédéric tells Louise he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) cannot marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>). Frédéric and Rosanette settle into a cozy domestic life.
However, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) finds out that Arnoux and Madame Arnoux are nearly estranged,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) visits Madame Arnoux, and they kiss. Rosanette, who has followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>), sees this. At home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) is so angry he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) nearly hits her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>), but
Rosanette reveals that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) is pregnant. Frédéric decides to make
Madame Dambreuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) mistress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) gives in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) is glad to be
deceiving Rosanette. Deslauriers begins working for Dambreuse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) is in
touch with Roque. Dambreuse dies, and Madame Dambreuse asks Frédéric
to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) agrees, then finds out Dambreuse has left nothing
to Madame Dambreuse. Rosanette gives birth to a son, and Frédéric
secretly splits his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) time between the two women. Rosanette is unable to pay off some debts she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) owes, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) tries to cash in some shares Arnoux gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>), it turns
out they are worthless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) takes him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to court but loses, although
Deslauriers assures her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) can win on a different charge. Deslauriers goes to Nogent and spends the summer with
Roque. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) wants to win over Louise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) tells the Roques and
Madame Moreau that Frédéric is going to marry Madame Dambreuse. Rosanette eventually wins her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) suit against Arnoux. But
when Frédéric goes to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreau</b></font>) finds that the baby has
just died. Pellerin paints a portrait of the dead child and tells
Frédéric that Arnoux is leaving Paris with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) family because they
are so poor, thanks in part to Rosanette's lawsuit, unless they
can find twelve thousand francs. Frédéric tricks Madame Dambreuse
into giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) the money, but it is too late. The Arnouxes have
left. Madame Dambreuse finds out why Frédéric wanted the money and
vows revenge. Deslauriers, still angry that Madame Arnoux rebuffed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) advances, also wants revenge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) advises Madame Dambreuse to
sell some debts Arnoux owes her (<font color='blue'><b>Frédéric</b></font>) at auction. All the Arnouxes' furniture
and possessions will be sold. Madame Dambreuse tricks Frédéric into attending the auction, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Frédéric</b></font>) buys something. Frédéric leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Frédéric</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) goes to Nogent, thinking
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) will marry Louise, but Deslauriers has already married her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>). Back
in Paris, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) sees Dussardier get killed by a policeman, who turns
out to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) friend Senecal. Several years go by. One day, Madame Arnoux surprises
him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) at home. They renew their love for each other. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>)
takes off her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) hat, Frédéric sees that her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) hair is all white. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>)
has come to give herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellerin</b></font>) is uninterested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) leaves. Frédéric and Deslauriers reminisce about the past. They
decide that their best memory is when they tried to sneak into a
brothel when they were much younger.
