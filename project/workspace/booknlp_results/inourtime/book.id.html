The stories, which are titled, are separated by vignettes, each of which is a chapter. The first story, <div class="bookquote">``On the Quai at Smyrna,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>introduces the war through a description of an evacuation. Then, <div class="bookquote">``Indian Camp,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Nick Adams</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Nick Adams</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The End of Something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Nick Adams</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Three-Day Blow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Nick Adams</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Battler''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Nick Adams</b></font>)</div>and perhaps <div class="bookquote">``A Very Short Story''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Nick Adams</b></font>)</div>all describe an encounter in the life of Nick Adams. Through these stories, Nick seems to be growing up. The vignettes are scenes from war, in which few characters are named. Chapter VI, after <div class="bookquote">``The Battler,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Nick Adams</b></font>)</div>is about Nick in the war. After that, the vignettes turn away from stories of the war and the short stories take up a different subject. <div class="bookquote">``A Soldier's Home''  (<font color='red'><b>a soldier</b></font>)</div>is about a soldier named Krebs returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Krebs</b></font>) hometown. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. And Mrs. Elliot,''  (<font color='red'><b>couples</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cat in the Rain,''  (<font color='red'><b>couples</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Out of Season''  (<font color='red'><b>couples</b></font>)</div>are all about American couples living or vacationing in Europe. <div class="bookquote">``Cross-Country Snow''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>is about two men -LRB-one of whom is named Nick-RRB- skiing together. <div class="bookquote">``My Old Man''  (<font color='red'><b>a jockey son</b></font>)</div>is about a jockey and his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) son. Then, <div class="bookquote">``Big Two-Hearted River,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Nick Adams</b></font>)</div>parts I and II, are about the return of Nick Adams to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) fishing ground, the forest around which and town of which have been burnt down. The vignettes that separate these stories vary in content but mostly deal with bullfighting. The final vignette, <div class="bookquote">``L'Envoi,''  (<font color='red'><b>a king</b></font>)</div>is a surreal story about a visit to a Greek king.
