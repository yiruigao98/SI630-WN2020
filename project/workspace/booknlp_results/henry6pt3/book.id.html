Warwick urges York to take the throne. As York sits, Henry enters with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) followers, who want to fight York right there. Henry urges calm and asks York to descend from the throne. York makes public his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) alleged claim to the throne, while Henry defends his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hereditary possession of the crown. Suspecting that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) claim to the throne may be spurious, Henry asks York to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rule while he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lives, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will pass the throne on to the house of York on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) death. York agrees and departs, but Henry's nobles are astonished that he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) would deny his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) son the birthright of becoming king on his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) father's death. Margaret, Henry's queen, arrives and accuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) of being an unnatural father for having disinherited his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) son and a bad ruler for thinking that York will let him (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) rule. Back in the town of York, Richard's sons Edward and Richard, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) follower Montague, urge York to take the throne immediately, rather than await Henry's death. York insists he (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) has sworn an oath to let Henry rule, but Richard easily convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) that the oath was not binding. Meanwhile, Margaret's forces arrive to challenge York. Richard's other son Rutland is captured and killed on the way home by Clifford, who wants to avenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) father's death at York's hand. York's troops are losing the battle, and York is captured by Margaret and Clifford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) offers him (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) a handkerchief dipped in Rutland's blood and challenges him (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) tears with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>York</b></font>) rails against her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) unnatural, and Clifford and Margaret stab him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) to death. Edward and Richard wonder about the fate of their father, when they see a vision of three suns on the horizon, which Edward believes is a sign that the three York brothers must become as one. Richard isn't so sure, preferring to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) allegiance only to himself. A messenger arrives with news of York's death, and the brothers are devastated. Warwick and Montague prepare to march to spar again with Margaret's forces, this time bringing the aid of York's other son George's troops. Margaret and Clifford, with their followers, meet Henry at the town of York. Clifford urges Henry to undo his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) disinheritance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) son, but Henry isn't convinced that sons automatically appreciate that which their fathers leave them, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) didn't enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father Henry V's legacy. Edward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) men burst in and demand the throne. The nobles from each side insult each other, and Henry tries to speak, but none will listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Edward blames Margaret's pride for the civil war, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) declares that they will have to argue on the field of battle, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) won't let Henry speak. Richard hunts Clifford on the field of battle in order to revenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brother's and father's death. The tides of the battle ebb and flow as Henry watches from afar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sees two soldiers drag dead bodies away from the scene of the fighting, trying to find valuables to steal. As the soldiers remove the armor from the bodies, one discovers he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has accidentally killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own father, and the other, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) son. Henry mourns that the battles of the nation have come to this level of unnaturalness. Henry's son Prince Edward urges him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to flee. Clifford is wounded and dies. Edward sees he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has won the battle, though Henry is nowhere to be found. They head to London to crown Edward and to give new titles to Richard and George. Meanwhile, as Henry wanders through the forest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is arrested by two men who support Edward. Edward sends Warwick to France to ask for the hand of the king of France's sister, and Margaret goes to France to ask for aid against Edward. In London, Lady Gray petitions Edward to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) land back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) takes a liking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brothers are annoyed to hear Edward's enthused announcement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) imminent marriage. Richard, alone, considers his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) potential route to the throne. Many people stand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) way, but what alternative is there? He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) could enjoy the pleasures of the court, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) physical abnormalities, including a hump back and withered arm, make him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) undesirable. Therefore, nothing remains for him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) but to connive and plot to get the crown. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) decides he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) will play the role of the good brother and subject, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) plots ways to eliminate everyone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) way to the throne. In France, Warwick and Margaret arrive at the same time. King Louis decides to give the hand of his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) sister, Lady Bona, to Edward, thus, denying Margaret aid, when a messenger arrives with news of Edward's marriage. Insulted to have been sent on a futile errand, Warwick changes sides, pledging his (<font color='blue'><b>Warwick</b></font>) allegiance to Henry. Louis gives Margaret troops to fight with Edward. In England, Edward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brothers and lords discuss his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marriage. They receive news that Warwick and Margaret have joined forces. George is so upset by Edward's new marriage that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) leaves with Somerset to join with Warwick. In preparations for the coming battles, Edward is captured. Seeing George on the enemy's side, Edward gives up the throne and consents to be imprisoned at Warwick's brother's estate. Yet Richard and Hastings soon spring Edward from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gilded prison. Warwick, George, and their nobles find Henry in the Tower and free him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Henry says he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wants to be king in name only, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) names Warwick and George as joint protectors of the kingdom. They receive word that Edward has escaped to Brittany, from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) soon returns with reinforcements. Returning to the town of York, Edward thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wants only to be the Duke of York, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) followers urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to seek the crown. Henry's followers go to gather troops to battle Edward. Edward and Richard capture Henry and send him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to the Tower before they march to meet Warwick's army. Edward's army meets Warwick's forces, and Edward asks Warwick if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) will again swear allegiance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). Warwick refuses. Warwick's supporters arrive, including George. Richard convinces George to break with Warwick, and the forces prepare to fight. Warwick is wounded in battle and dies. Warwick's surviving supporters, Somerset and Oxford, go to join Margaret's army. Margaret urges on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) forces, and they meet Edward's army. Edward wins this battle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sends Somerset and Oxford away, kills Prince Edward, and imprisons a mourning Margaret. Richard sneaks off to the Tower, where Henry awaits. Henry prophesizes that thousands will suffer because of Richard's deeds, for Richard was born under all the most inauspicious and evil signs. Richard kills Henry and declares himself separated from the ties of family and brotherhood. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was punished by the heavens with such unfortunate physical attributes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) will fight for himself alone hereafter. And with Henry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) son out of the way, Richard's next goal is to eliminate George and Edward. Edward's son has been born, and George and Richard kiss the child. Edward calls for festivities to celebrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) attainment of the throne. At last there is no one to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)--except his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own brother.
