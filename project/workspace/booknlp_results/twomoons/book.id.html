Along the way, Salamanca, or Sal, tells her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) grandparents the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) best friend, Phoebe Winterbottom, whose mother, like Sal's, unexpectedly decides to leave home. Sal meets Phoebe when Sal and her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) father leave their farm in Bybanks, Kentucky, to Euclid, Ohio, where Margaret Cadaver, whom Sal's father befriended after her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mother's death, lives. Phoebe is a high-strung, prim, and wildly imaginative girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) feels certain that some sinister connection exists between the morbidly-named Mrs. Cadaver, who is her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) next-door neighbor, the mysterious notes that keep appearing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) family's doorstep, and the strange boy, whom Phoebe dubs the lunatic, who appears at the house one day. Sal gradually becomes caught up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) friend's melodrama and finds herself engaged in a heady flirtation with a boy from school, Ben. Sal intersperses Phoebe's story with memories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) mother, who was a loving, spontaneous, and gentle woman who could not shake off a deep sense of inadequacy next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) selfless husband. Phoebe's mother shares this sense of alienation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) family routinely ignores her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>), and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) works assiduously as a mother and wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) wonders at the smallness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) life. By this point in Sal's tale, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) grandparents have reached South Dakota. They stop to swim in the Missouri River, where a snake bites Gram's leg. Sal and her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) grandfather rush Gram to the hospital, and although Gram recovers by the next morning, her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) health begins to falter after this point. One day, Phoebe's mother disappears, leaving nary a word of explanation. Phoebe feels certain she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) has been kidnapped and begins an obsessive investigation for clues. Sal then retells the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) own mother's disappearance. Sal, playing a good distance from the house, had fallen from the tree and broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) leg. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) mother, who was pregnant, carried Sal home and rushed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to the hospital. Later, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went into an early labor, lost the baby, and nearly lost her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life. Overwhelmed with sadness, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) insisted on taking a trip by herself to visit a cousin in Lewiston, Idaho. Sal and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grandparents are following the path Sal's mother took on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trip to Idaho. Phoebe's family is growing more and more upset as the days go by, and Mr. Winterbottom, a reserved and stoic man, begins crying one day when Phoebe desperately insists that Mrs. Winterbottom loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) too much to leave without an explanation. Finally, Sal and Phoebe rush over to the police office to offer them the meager evidence they have collected. While there, Sal finds that the strange boy, the lunatic, who appeared on the porch earlier, is actually the police sergeant's son. Later that day, Sal discovers that Mrs. Cadaver, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) resisted and resented due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) friendship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) father, suffered a great loss only a few years prior, when a car accident killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) husband and blinded her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) mother. Sal and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) grandparents take in Old Faithful, and Gram, whose breathing is troubled, revels in the splendor of the powerful geyser. When they leave Yellowstone National Park, Sal resumes her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) story, driven by a sense of urgency to finish it as soon as possible. Sal and Phoebe determine that the sergeant's son lives at a nearby college campus, and, convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Sal</b></font>) holds the key to the mystery, take a bus to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Sal</b></font>). On campus, the two girls find the lunatic and Mrs. Winterbottom sitting on a bench, holding hands. Sal, overwhelmed, runs away as fast as her (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) legs can carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) finds herself at a mental hospital, where, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) finds Ben and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) mother, who is a patient at the hospital. The two young people giddily share a delicious first kiss. Mrs. Winterbottom returns home a few days later and explains to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) family that the lunatic is actually her (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) illegitimate son, about whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) had always been afraid to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) family for fear of letting them down. The Winterbottoms are shaken, but ready to listen to Mrs. Winterbottom. At the same time, Sal decides that she (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbottom</b></font>) will make amends with Mrs. Cadaver and listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) story. Mrs. Cadaver explains to Sal that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadaver</b></font>) and Sal's mother became friends on the long bus trip from Ohio to Idaho, and that Mrs. Cadaver and Sal's father became friends because Mrs. Cadaver was the lone survivor of the accident that killed Sal's mother and was able to tell Sal's father about the last days and moments of Sal's mother's life. Sal and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grandparents have reached Coeur D'Alene in northern Idaho, but Gramps and Sal must rush Gram, who is gravely ill, to a hospital. Gramps will not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) side, but knowing that Sal feels she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must visit her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's grave on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) birthday, which is the next day, allows Sal to drive down the steep, tortuous roads on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own. Sal makes the perilous drive in the dead of night, and finally stops at an outlook on a steep, switchbacked road where her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's bus, more than a year prior, had tumbled off the road. Sal climbs down to inspect the wrecked, abandoned bus. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) returns to the car, a sheriff stands ready to arrest her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sal</b></font>) hears her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sal</b></font>) drives Sal to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's grave and later back to Coeur D'Alene. Sal, already overwhelmed by tragedy, discovers that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grandmother has died. Sal and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father later return to their farm in Bybanks, Kentucky and begin trying to rebuild their lives their without her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother. Sal, who has made peace with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's tragic death, looks forward to each day on the farm and to the upcoming visit of all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends from Euclid, Ohio.
