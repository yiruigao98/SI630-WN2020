transformed into a large insect. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) looks around his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) room, which appears normal, and
decides to go back to sleep to forget about what has happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) attempts to roll over,
only to discover that he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) cannot due to his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) new body--he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) is stuck on his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) hard, convex
back. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) tries to scratch an itch on his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) stomach, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) touches himself with one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) many new legs, he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) is disgusted. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) reflects on how dreary life as a traveling
salesman is and how he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) would quit if his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) parents and sister did not depend so much on
his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) income. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) turns to the clock and sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) has overslept and missed his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) train to
work. Gregor's mother knocks on the door, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) answers her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Gregor finds that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>)
voice has changed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) family suspects that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) may be ill, so they ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) to open the
door, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) keeps locked out of habit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) tries to get out of bed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) cannot
maneuver his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) transformed body. While struggling to move, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) hears his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) office manager
come into the family's apartment to find out why Gregor has not shown up to work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>)
eventually rocks himself to the floor and calls out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) will open the door
momentarily. Through the door, the office manager warns Gregor of the consequences of missing
work and hints that Gregor's recent work has not been satisfactory. Gregor protests and
tells the office manager that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) will be there shortly. Neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) family nor the
office manager can understand what Gregor says, and they suspect that something may be
seriously wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>). Gregor manages to unlock and open the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) mouth,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) has no hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) begs the office manager's forgiveness for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) late start.
Horrified by Gregor's appearance, the office manager bolts from the apartment. Gregor
tries to catch up with the fleeing office manager, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) father drives him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) back into
the bedroom with a cane and a rolled newspaper. Gregor injures himself squeezing back
through the doorway, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) father slams the door shut. Gregor, exhausted, falls
asleep. Gregor wakes and sees that someone has put milk and bread in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) room. Initially
excited, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) quickly discovers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) has no taste for milk, once one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) favorite
foods. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) settles himself under a couch and listens to the quiet apartment. The next
morning, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) sister Grete comes in, sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) has not touched the milk, and replaces
it with rotting food scraps, which Gregor happily eats. This begins a routine in which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) sister feeds him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) and cleans up while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) hides under the couch, afraid that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>)
appearance will frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Gregor spends his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) time listening through the wall to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>)
family members talking. They often discuss the difficult financial situation they find
themselves in now that Gregor can't provide for them. Gregor also learns that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) mother
wants to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) sister and father will not let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Gregor grows more comfortable with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) changed body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) begins climbing the walls
and ceiling for amusement. Discovering Gregor's new pastime, Grete decides to remove
some of the furniture to give Gregor more space. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mother begin taking
furniture away, but Gregor finds their actions deeply distressing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) tries to save a
picture on the wall of a woman wearing a fur hat, fur scarf, and a fur muff. Gregor's
mother sees him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) hanging on the wall and passes out. Grete calls out to Gregor--the first
time anyone has spoken directly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) since his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) transformation. Gregor runs out of the
room and into the kitchen. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) father returns from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) new job, and misunderstanding the
situation, believes Gregor has tried to attack the mother. The father throws apples at
Gregor, and one sinks into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) back and remains lodged there. Gregor manages to get back
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) bedroom but is severely injured. Gregor's family begins leaving the bedroom door open for a few hours each evening
so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) can watch them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) family wearing down as a result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) transformation
and their new poverty. Even Grete seems to resent Gregor now, feeding him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) and cleaning
up with a minimum of effort. The family replaces their maid with a cheap cleaning lady
who tolerates Gregor's appearance and speaks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) occasionally. They also take on
three boarders, requiring them to move excess furniture into Gregor's room, which
distresses Gregor. Gregor has also lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) taste for the food Grete brings and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>)
almost entirely ceases eating. One evening, the cleaning lady leaves Gregor's door open while the boarders lounge
about the living room. Grete has been asked to play the violin for them, and Gregor
creeps out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) bedroom to listen. The boarders, who initially seemed interested in
Grete, grow bored with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) performance, but Gregor is transfixed by it. One of the
boarders spots Gregor and they become alarmed. Gregor's father tries to shove the
boarders back into their rooms, but the three men protest and announce that they will
move out immediately without paying rent because of the disgusting conditions in the
apartment. Grete tells her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) parents that they must get rid of Gregor or they will all be
ruined. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father agrees, wishing Gregor could understand them and would leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>)
own accord. Gregor does in fact understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom. There,
determined to rid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) family of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregor</b></font>) presence, Gregor dies. Upon discovering that Gregor is dead, the family feels a great sense of relief.
The father kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the cleaning lady, who has
disposed of Gregor's body. The family takes a trolley ride out to the countryside,
during which they consider their finances. Months of spare living as a result of
Gregor's condition have left them with substantial savings. They decide to move to a
better apartment. Grete appears to have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) strength and beauty back, which leads her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
parents to think about finding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a husband.
