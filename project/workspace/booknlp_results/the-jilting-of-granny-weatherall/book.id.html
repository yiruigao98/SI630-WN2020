Saying there is nothing wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>), Granny orders the doctor to leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) speaks in a condescending tone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>), even after she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) snaps at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). Granny reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>)'s survived more serious sicknesses before he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was even born. Closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) eyes, Granny feels as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) is in a hammock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) hears the doctor and one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) daughters, Cornelia, talking about Granny's illness. It annoys her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) that they are talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) is within earshot. Cornelia's goodness also irritates Granny, who says aloud that she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) would enjoy spanking Cornelia. Granny thinks about what she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) has to do tomorrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) believes it's important to keep the house clean and orderly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) decides that she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) must hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) letters that George and John had written her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>). Granny thinks about death, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) prepared herself for twenty years ago, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) felt that the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) life was near. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) father, who lived until he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was 102, attributed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) longevity to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daily hot toddy, a liquor made from tree sap. Granny asks for a hot toddy and then snaps at Cornelia. It irritates Granny terribly to think that Cornelia is humoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) hates the small gestures people make when under the mistaken impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) won't notice them. Granny considers herself a better housekeeper and harder worker than Cornelia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>)'s still young enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) children to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) for advice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) longs for the old days, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) children were small. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) imagines showing John how well the children turned out. They are older now than John was when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) died. After his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) death, Granny changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) had to fence in acres of land and act as a midwife and nurse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) thinks John would appreciate the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) kept nearly all her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) patients alive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) remembers lighting the lamps when her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) children were young. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) recalls how they stood close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>), moving away once the frightening dark had been dissipated. Granny thanks God for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) help and begins to say the Hail Mary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) then thinks about the necessity of picking all the fruit and not letting any go to waste. Granny feels as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) pillow is suffocating her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) remembers the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) was supposed to get married for the first time. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) groom, George, never came to the church. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) can't separate the idea of hell from the memory of George. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) admonishes herself not to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``wounded vanity''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>overpower her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>). Cornelia comes in and presses a cold cloth to Granny's forehead and comments that everyone will arrive at the house soon. Confused, Granny asks whether they are going to have a party for someone's birthday. Doctor Harry arrives. Granny protests that she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) just saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) five minutes ago, but Cornelia says that it's now night. Granny makes a witty retort, but when no one answers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) realizes she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) must not have spoken aloud. The doctor gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) an injection. Granny thinks about Hapsy, the daughter she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) wants to see the most, and imagines seeing Hapsy holding a baby and greeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>). Cornelia asks if there is anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelia</b></font>) wants to say or anything Cornelia can do. Granny wants to see George and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>)'s forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and has had a rich life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) wants him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) has everything he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took from her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) thinks these thoughts, however, it occurs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) that there's something she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>)'s still missing. A terrible pain cuts through her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) imagines that she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>)'s in labor and must send John for the doctor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) believes that after she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) gives birth to this last baby, she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) will regain her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) strength. Cornelia says that Father Connolly has arrived. Granny thinks about the priest, who cares as much about tea and chatting as he (<font color='blue'><b>Connolly</b></font>) does about the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) soul and who often tells humorous stories about an Irishman confessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) sins. Granny is not concerned about her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) believes that her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) favorite saints will surely usher her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) into heaven. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) thinks again of her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) first wedding day when her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) whole world crumbled and the priest caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) fell. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) promised to kill George, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) not to. Granny thinks about herself and John comforting the children when they had nightmares and about Hapsy getting ready to deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) baby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) looks at the room and sees a picture of John in which his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes, which were blue, have been made to look black. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) remembers that the man who made the picture called it a perfect copy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) said it wasn't a picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) husband. On the bedside table, Granny sees a candle, crucifix, and light with a blue lampshade. The lampshade looks ridiculous to Granny. Seeing a glow around Doctor Harry, Granny jokes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) looks like a saint, which is the closest he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'ll ever come to being one. No one understands what she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) said. Granny imagines getting into a cart beside a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) knows. Up ahead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) sees trees and hears birds <div class="bookquote">``singing a Mass.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) rosary while Father Connolly speaks Latin in a tone that strikes Granny as melodramatic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) imagines that he (<font color='blue'><b>Connolly</b></font>)'s tickling her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) thinks again of George. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) hears thunder and sees lightning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) thinks Hapsy has arrived, but it is Lydia. Jimmy is there too. Granny realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>)'s dying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) feels surprised and unready. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) thinks of small, last-minute advice and instructions she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) wants to give. Aloud, Granny tells Cornelia that she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) can't go yet. Granny worries about what will happen if she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) can't find Hapsy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) looks for a sign from God, but none comes. This absence is the worst sorrow of all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) feels she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) has been jilted again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) dies.
