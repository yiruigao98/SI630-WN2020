When the novel opens, Tod has been in Hollywood for only three months and still marvels at the people and architecture of the city, both of which involve blatant and constant artifice and masquerading. Tod is most interested in the section of the population that does not seem to be masquerading--the imported, lower middle-class Midwestern immigrants who stand around the city and stare at the masqueraders. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) head, Tod has labeled these people the ones who <div class="bookquote">``have come to California to die''  (<font color='red'><b>the ones</b></font>)</div>and has decided to paint them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) upcoming masterpiece, an apocalyptic scene he (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) has titled <div class="bookquote">``The Burning of Los Angeles.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) short time in Los Angeles, Tod has acquired an odd assortment of friends, including Abe Kusich, a belligerent dwarf bookie; Faye Greener, an untalented extra who wants to be a film star; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Greener</b></font>) father, Harry Greener, a former vaudeville clown who never found work in Hollywood but keeps up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) clown act all day, even though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) only job now is selling homemade silver polish door-to-door. Abe helped Tod find his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) current apartment, which Tod only decided to take upon seeing Faye Greener, who lives downstairs. Tod desires Faye, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Faye</b></font>) has unsentimentally told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) that they must remain polite friends, as Tod has no money and is not particularly good-looking. Tod hopes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) chances with Faye have improved now that Faye's father Harry has fallen ill and Tod visits with the man nightly. Harry fell ill at the house of Homer Simpson, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was trying to sell silver polish. Homer has recently moved to Hollywood from Iowa on doctor's orders after a bout with pneumonia. Homer is not working, living on money he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) has saved and trying to forget the uncomfortable memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) first and only near- sexual encounter, which occurred with a female tenant at the Iowa hotel where he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) once worked as a bookkeeper. Ignoring his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) instinct not to make himself vulnerable to excitement, Homer begins courting Faye. Tod, sensing that Homer is somewhat like the type of people he (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) wants to paint in <div class="bookquote">``The Burning of Los Angeles,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>befriends Homer out of curiosity. Homer and Tod are not Faye's only admirers; Tod accompanies Faye out to a campsite in the hills where her (<font color='blue'><b>Faye</b></font>) sometime-boyfriend Earle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) companion Miguel live. The three men all lust after Faye, who enjoys being desired. The evening ends when Earle clubs the flirtatious Miguel on the head and Tod futilely chases after Faye in the woods, intending to rape her (<font color='blue'><b>Faye</b></font>). Not long after this evening, Faye's father dies and Faye moves in with Homer as a <div class="bookquote">``business''  (<font color='red'><b>Homer</b></font>)</div>arrangement. Homer provides Faye's food and lodging and buys her (<font color='blue'><b>Faye</b></font>) elegant clothing so she (<font color='blue'><b>Faye</b></font>) can have a better chance at a movie career. Faye takes advantage of Homer's meekness and generosity, easily compelling him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) to allow Earle and Miguel to move into his (<font color='blue'><b>Earle</b></font>) garage. Tod, newly uncomfortable with the violent lust that Faye's self-contained fantasy existence inspires in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>), vows to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Faye</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) puts away his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) sketches of her (<font color='blue'><b>Faye</b></font>) and concentrates on the other subjects he (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) must draw for <div class="bookquote">``The Burning of Los Angeles.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Tod frequents Hollywood churches, each of which follow a different guide to salvation, but all of which contain the same type of fanatical, prophetic worshippers. Homer and Faye seek Tod out after several weeks, convincing him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) to attend a cockfight Miguel and Earle are holding in Homer's garage. Tod brings along his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) screenwriter friend, Claude Estee. The dwarf bookie, Abe Kusich, also attends. After the violent cockfight, Claude, Abe, Earle, and Miguel sit in Homer's living room, drinking and lusting after Faye, who is barely dressed in unbuttoned silk pajamas. Tod and Homer remain removed from the party. Homer tries to talk to Tod about his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) feelings for Faye, but Tod no longer has patience to listen to admirers of Faye pine away, and becomes annoyed with Homer's slow explanations and clumsy attempts at friendship. The evening ends in excessive sexual desire and violence, as Claude and Tod save Abe from nearly being killed in a fight with Earle and Miguel. In the early morning, Homer and Earle discover Miguel in bed with Faye, which leads Earle and Miguel to fight. The next day, Tod finds Homer in a nearly catatonic state. Faye has moved out and Homer has decided to return to Iowa. Tod leaves Homer alone for a few hours and goes downtown, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) gets trapped up in a large crowd waiting outside Kahn's theater for several movie stars to arrive at a premiere. Tod sees Homer walking near the crowd, still unresponsive and now carrying two suitcases. Tod watches as Homer sits on a bench near the crowd and Adore, a boy who lives in Homer's neighborhood, torments Homer from behind a tree, finally throwing a rock that hits Homer in the face. Homer gets up and chases the boy, stomping on Adore's back after the boy trips and falls. Tod tries to pull Homer off, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) can succeed, the crowd has jumped on Homer. The crowd riots and Tod is caught in the violent, sexual frenzy. To escape the reality of the mob's violence, Tod immerses himself in thoughts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) painting, <div class="bookquote">``The Burning of Los Angeles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tod</b></font>)</div>and the riot he (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) plans to depict in it. Tod can no longer see Homer. Tod is eventually rescued by a policeman and driven away from the mob. The final image of the novel shows Tod sitting in the car, unable to determine whether the siren sound he (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) hears is coming from the police vehicle or from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) own mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) laughs and screams along with the siren from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tod</b></font>) seat in the back of the car.
