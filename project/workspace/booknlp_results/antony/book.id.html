rulers of the Roman Empire, spends his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) time in Egypt,
living a life of decadence and conducting an affair with the country's
beautiful queen, Cleopatra. When a message arrives informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>)
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) wife, Fulvia, is dead and that Pompey is raising an army
to rebel against the triumvirate, Antony decides to return to Rome.
In Antony's absence, Octavius Caesar and Lepidus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) fellow triumvirs,
worry about Pompey's increasing strength. Caesar condemns Antony
for neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) duties as a statesman and military officer in
order to live a decadent life by Cleopatra's side. The news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) wife's death and imminent battle pricks
Antony's sense of duty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) feels compelled to return to Rome.
Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) and Caesar quarrel, while Lepidus ineffectually
tries to make peace. Realizing that an alliance is necessary to
defeat Pompey, Antony and Caesar agree that Antony will marry Caesar's sister,
Octavia, who will solidify their loyalty to one another. Enobarbus,
Antony's closest friend, predicts to Caesar's men that, despite
the marriage, Antony will surely return to Cleopatra. In Egypt, Cleopatra learns of Antony's marriage and flies
into a jealous rage. However, when a messenger delivers word that
Octavia is plain and unimpressive, Cleopatra becomes confident that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) will win Antony back. The triumvirs meet Pompey and settle their differences
without going to battle. Pompey agrees to keep peace in exchange
for rule over Sicily and Sardinia. That evening, the four men drink
to celebrate their truce. One of Pompey's soldiers discloses to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) a plan to assassinate the triumvirs, thereby delivering world
power into Pompey's hands, but Pompey dismisses the scheme as an
affront to his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) honor. Meanwhile, one of Antony's -generals wins
a victory over the kingdom of Parthia. Antony and Octavia depart for Athens. Once they are gone,
Caesar breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) truce, wages war against Pompey, and defeats him (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>). After
using Lepidus's army to secure a victory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) accuses Lepidus of treason,
imprisons him (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>), and confiscates his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) land and possessions. This news
angers Antony, as do the rumors that Caesar has been speaking out
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) in public. Octavia pleads with Antony to maintain a
peaceful relationship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Octavia</b></font>) brother. Should Antony and Caesar
fight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Octavia</b></font>) says, her (<font color='blue'><b>Octavia</b></font>) affections would be painfully divided. Antony
dispatches her (<font color='blue'><b>Octavia</b></font>) to Rome on a peace mission, and quickly returns to
Egypt and Cleopatra. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) raises a large army to fight Caesar,
and Caesar, incensed over Antony's treatment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) sister, responds
in kind. Caesar commands his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) army and navy to Egypt. Ignoring all
advice to the contrary, Antony elects to fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) at sea, allowing
Cleopatra to command a ship despite Enobarbus's strong objections.
Antony's forces lose the battle when Cleopatra's ship flees and
Antony's follows, leaving the rest of the fleet vulnerable. Antony despairs, condemning Cleopatra for leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>)
into infamy but quickly forgiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) and Cleopatra send requests
to their conqueror: Antony asks to be allowed to live in Egypt,
while Cleopatra asks that her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) kingdom be passed down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) rightful heirs.
Caesar dismisses Antony's request, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) promises Cleopatra a fair
hearing if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) betrays her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) lover. Cleopatra seems to be giving thought
to Caesar's message when Antony barges in, curses her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) treachery,
and orders the innocent messenger whipped. When, moments later,
Antony forgives Cleopatra, Enobarbus decides that his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) master is
finished and defects to Caesar's camp. Antony meets Caesar's troops in battle and scores an
unexpected victory. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) learns of Enobarbus's desertion, Antony
laments his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) own bad fortune, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) believes has corrupted an
honorable man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) friend's possessions to Caesar's camp
and returns to Cleopatra to celebrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) victory. Enobarbus, undone
by shame at his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) own disloyalty, bows under the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) guilt
and dies. Another day brings another battle, and once again Antony
meets Caesar at sea. As before, the Egyptian fleet proves treacherous;
it abandons the fight and leaves Antony to suffer defeat. Convinced that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) lover has betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>), Antony vows to kill Cleopatra. In order
to protect herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) quarters herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) monument and sends
word that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) has committed suicide. Antony, racked with grief,
determines to join his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) queen in the afterlife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) commands one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) attendants to fulfill his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) promise of unquestioned service and kill
him (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>). The attendant kills himself instead. Antony then falls on his (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) own
sword, but the wound is not immediately fatal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) is carried to Cleopatra's
monument, where the lovers are reunited briefly before Antony's
death. Caesar takes the queen prisoner, planning to display her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>)
in Rome as a testament to the might of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) empire, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) learns
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) plan and kills herself with the help of several poisonous snakes.
Caesar has her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) buried beside Antony.
