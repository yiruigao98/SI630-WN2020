Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) and hidden from view sleeps Willie. A bell rings and wakes her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) Winnie. She (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) recites a prayer and goes through several cleaning rituals--brushing her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) teeth, etc.--with implements from the bag. She (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) laments that <div class="bookquote">``poor Willie''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>has no interest in life, but concedes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) constant sleeping is a gift she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) had. She (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) tells herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) must not complain, as she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) has much to be thankful for. Winnie tries to read something written on the toothbrush handle, but can only make out <div class="bookquote">``genuine pure.''  (<font color='red'><b>Winnie</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) pokes Willie with the parasol to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) drops it, but Willie, still hidden, hands it back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) removes a revolver from the bag, kisses it and replaces it, then takes out a bottle of red medicine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) drinks from it and tosses it in Willie's direction, where it shatters. Willie sits up, and Winnie turns to see blood trickling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) bald head. Winnie tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) to put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) underwear, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) does not do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) proclaims it will be <div class="bookquote">``another happy day''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) reads a newspaper. Willie reads out a headline that announces the death in the bathtub of a priest, and reads about a job opening for youth. Winnie uses a magnifying glass and finally makes out <div class="bookquote">``genuine pure hog's setae,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winnie</b></font>)</div>or bristles, on the toothbrush handle. Winnie sees that Willie has a postcard, and asks to look at it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) is appalled by the picture and returns it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>). Winnie regrets not letting Willie sleep, and wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) could tolerate being alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) says that if Willie died or left her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) would never say another word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) anxiously wonders if she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) combed her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) hair and brushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) teeth, and locates the brush and comb in her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) bag. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) resolves to <div class="bookquote">``brush and comb them later.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) stumbles when she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) wonders if hair is referred to as <div class="bookquote">``them''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and asks Willie, who answers <div class="bookquote">``It.''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie</b></font>)</div>Winnie is overjoyed that Willie is speaking, and pronounces it a <div class="bookquote">``happy day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) tells Willie to crawl back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) hole to avoid the sun, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) does. Winnie thanks him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) for reassuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) can hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>), as otherwise she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) would have only the bag. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) asks Willie if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) will leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) soon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) does not answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) says the earth around her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) is tightening, and wonders if she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) has put on weight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) sees an ant on the ground and watches it carry a little white ball through the grass. Willie says it was eggs, and then says <div class="bookquote">``Formication.''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie</b></font>)</div>Willie breaks into laughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) joins him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), but they alternate who is laughing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) says there is no better way to <div class="bookquote">``magnify the Almighty''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>then by laughing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) little jokes, then wonders if she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) and Willie were laughing at different things. Winnie asks Willie if she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) were ever <div class="bookquote">``lovable,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) does not respond. Though it is getting late, she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) says it is too soon for her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) song. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) reminds herself not to <div class="bookquote">``overdo''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>the bag, but to use it and think about the point in the future <div class="bookquote">``when words must fail.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) reaches into the bag and accidentally takes out the revolver, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) disgustedly throws back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) inspects the revolver again and asks Willie if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) remembers how he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) used to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) to keep it away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) killed himself. Winnie says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) is tired of Willie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>)'ll leave the revolver out from now on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) discusses her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) feeling that without being held down she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) would be sucked upward, and asks Willie if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) feels that way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) does not understand, even after she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) explains it. Winnie hoists, with difficulty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) parasol. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) ruminates on the danger of long days with little action or conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) cannot put the parasol down--she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) requires some change in the world for to move again. The parasol catches on fire, and Winnie throws it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) to extinguish it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) then considers that the words <div class="bookquote">``temperate''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``torrid''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>are <div class="bookquote">``empty words,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>as are her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) memories of when she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) had the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) legs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) reflects that if the earth ever covers her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) breasts, it will be as if no one has ever seen them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) remarks that the parasol will be back again tomorrow in perfect form. Winnie saddens and takes out a music-box from her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) bag, and plays the waltz duet from Franz Leh√°r's 1905 operetta, The Merry Widow, which Willie accompanies without words at the end. She (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>) becomes happy again, and when Willie refuses an encore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>) discusses the difficulty of singing when one's heart is not in it. Winnie feels she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) is being watched by someone, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) files her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) long nails, she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) thinks about a man named Shower--or possibly Cooker--with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fianc√©e and tells Willie her (<font color='blue'><b>fianc√©e</b></font>) image of them: they hold hands, carrying bags in their free hands, and stare at Winnie while they question Winnie's placement in the ground, fight, argue about Willie's and Winnie's usefulness to each other, contemplate digging Winnie out, then leave. Winnie sees that Willie is trying to crawl out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) whole. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) observes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) is no longer a good crawler, and urges him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) on as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) progresses to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) spot behind the mound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) dreams he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) would come to the other side so she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), but knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) cannot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) reads her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) toothbrush handle, with some difficulty, and asks what a hog is. Willie tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) becomes happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) reads the newspaper and reads out the job announcements, which are the same as before. Winnie tells herself to sing, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) does not sing, and then to pray, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) also does not do. The next day, Winnie is covered up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) neck in the mound and cannot move her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) head. A bell rings and she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) opens her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) eyes. Pausing continuously, she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) tries to talk to Willie, who doesn't respond, and surmises that Willie has died, or left her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``like the others.''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) saddens over her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) current condition, and grows anxious over the absence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) arms, breasts, and Willie. The bell rings, and Winnie asks Willie questions and, getting no response, says it's like him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) to not have an opinion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) recounts the story of a young girl, Mildred, who was undressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) doll in the middle of the night. Winnie reprimands Willie for not paying attention, then fearfully questions if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) may be stuck in the hole. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) remarks on the brief sadness she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) experiences after singing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) imagines Shower/Cooker with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) woman, both older, as they discuss Winnie's buried body. Then they fight and leave, still hand in hand and with their bags. Winnie resumes her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) story about Mildred, who dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) doll when a mouse ran up her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) leg. Mildred's whole family came running, but Winnie says it was too late. Winnie sees Willie crawling toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) in a fashionable outfit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) says it reminds her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) of the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) drops his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) hat and gloves and crawls toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) at Winnie's delighted urgings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) whispers <div class="bookquote">``Win.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) grows happy and sings the waltz duet <div class="bookquote">``I Love You So''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>that the music box played before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) closes her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) eyes, the bell rings, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) reopens them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) smiles at Willie, who looks at her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnie</b></font>) stops smiling. They continue looking at each other through a long pause.
