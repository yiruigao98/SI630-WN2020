Her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) sister, Josephine, tells her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) the news. Louise's husband's friend, Richards, learned about a railroad disaster when he (<font color='blue'><b>Richards</b></font>) was in the newspaper office and saw Louise's husband, Brently, on the list of those killed. Louise begins sobbing when Josephine tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) of Brently's death and goes upstairs to be alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) room. Louise sits down and looks out an open window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) sees trees, smells approaching rain, and hears a peddler yelling out what he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>)'s selling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) hears someone singing as well as the sounds of sparrows, and there are fluffy white clouds in the sky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) is young, with lines around her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) eyes. Still crying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) gazes into the distance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) feels apprehensive and tries to suppress the building emotions within her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>), but can't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) begins repeating the word Free! to herself over and over again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) heart beats quickly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) feels very warm. Louise knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>)'ll cry again when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) sees Brently's corpse. His (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) hands were tender, and he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) always looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) lovingly. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) imagines the years ahead, which belong only to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) now, and spreads her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) arms out joyfully with anticipation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) will be free, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) own without anyone to oppress her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) thinks that all women and men oppress one another even if they do it out of kindness. Louise knows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) often felt love for Brently but tells herself that none of that matters anymore. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) feels ecstatic with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) newfound sense of independence. Josephine comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) door, begging Louise to come out, warning her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>)'ll get sick if she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) doesn't. Louise tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) to go away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) fantasizes about all the days and years ahead and hopes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) lives a long life. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) opens the door, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) and Josephine start walking down the stairs, where Richards is waiting. The front door unexpectedly opens, and Brently comes in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richards</b></font>) hadn't been in the train accident or even aware that one had happened. Josephine screams, and Richards tries unsuccessfully to block Louise from seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Richards</b></font>). Doctors arrive and pronounce that Louise died of a heart attack brought on by happiness.
