Professor Higgins is a scientist of phonetics, and Colonel Pickering is a linguist of Indian dialects. The first bets the other that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) can, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) knowledge of phonetics, convince high London society that, in a matter of months, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) will be able to transform the cockney speaking Covent Garden flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, into a woman as poised and well-spoken as a duchess. The next morning, the girl appears at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) laboratory on Wimpole Street to ask for speech lessons, offering to pay a shilling, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may speak properly enough to work in a flower shop. Higgins makes merciless fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>), but is seduced by the idea of working his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) magic on her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>). Pickering goads him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) on by agreeing to cover the costs of the experiment if Higgins can pass Eliza off as a duchess at an ambassador's garden party. The challenge is taken, and Higgins starts by having his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) housekeeper bathe Eliza and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) new clothes. Then Eliza's father Alfred Doolittle comes to demand the return of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) daughter, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) real intention is to hit Higgins up for some money. The professor, amused by Doolittle's unusual rhetoric, gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) five pounds. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) way out, the dustman fails to recognize the now clean, pretty flower girl as his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) daughter. For a number of months, Higgins trains Eliza to speak properly. Two trials for Eliza follow. The first occurs at Higgins' mother's home, where Eliza is introduced to the Eynsford Hills, a trio of mother, daughter, and son. The son Freddy is very attracted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), and further taken with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) thinks is her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) affected <div class="bookquote">``small talk''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) slips into cockney. Mrs. Higgins worries that the experiment will lead to problems once it is ended, but Higgins and Pickering are too absorbed in their game to take heed. A second trial, which takes place some months later at an ambassador's party -LRB-and which is not actually staged-RRB-, is a resounding success. The wager is definitely won, but Higgins and Pickering are now bored with the project, which causes Eliza to be hurt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) throws Higgins' slippers at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) in a rage because she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) does not know what is to become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>), thereby bewildering him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) suggests she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) marry somebody. She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) returns him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) the hired jewelry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) accuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) of ingratitude. The following morning, Higgins rushes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) mother, in a panic because Eliza has run away. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) tail is Eliza's father, now unhappily rich from the trust of a deceased millionaire who took to heart Higgins' recommendation that Doolittle was England's <div class="bookquote">``most original moralist.''  (<font color='red'><b>Doolittle</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Higgins, who has been hiding Eliza upstairs all along, chides the two of them for playing with the girl's affections. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) enters, Eliza thanks Pickering for always treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) like a lady, but threatens Higgins that she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) will go work with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) rival phonetician, Nepommuck. The outraged Higgins cannot help but start to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>). As Eliza leaves for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) father's wedding, Higgins shouts out a few errands for her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) to run, assuming that she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) will return to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at Wimpole Street. Eliza, who has a lovelorn sweetheart in Freddy, and the wherewithal to pass as a duchess, never makes it clear whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) will or not.
