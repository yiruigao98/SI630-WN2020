The educated daughter of a
village headman fallen on hard times, Rukmani is married at the age of twelve to
Nathan, a tenant farmer. Nathan treats her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with kindness and respect as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) learns
the chores her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) new life requires. Within a year they have a beautiful daughter, Ira,
and good rice harvests. During the next six years, Rukmani does not conceive.
Troubled that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cannot produce a son for Nathan, Rukmani visits her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ill mother and
there meets Kenny, a foreign doctor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenny</b></font>) treats her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) infertility without Nathan's
knowledge. In quick succession, Rukmani bears five sons. With each birth, however,
the family has a little less to eat. When a tannery is built nearby, unpleasant
changes come to village life. Rukmani's two oldest sons eventually go to work there.
They help the family a great deal with their wages but are eventually dismissed for
being ringleaders in a labor strike. The year they arrange a good marriage for Ira, monsoon rains destroy all their
crops. Rukmani sacrifices her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) savings to buy food for the family. Ira's husband
returns Ira to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) parents' home because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is barren. Again Rukmani turns to Kenny
without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's knowledge, this time to help Ira conceive. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ira</b></font>) treatments are
too late, however, since Ira's husband has taken another woman. Rukmani becomes
pregnant again and bears her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) last son, Kuti. Caring for Kuti lifts Ira out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
depression and despair until the crops fail from drought and the family once again
goes hungry. They sell most of their possessions just to pay half of what they owe
the landowner for their lease. Reduced to foraging for roots and leaves, the family
begins to weaken and starve. Kenny secures a servant's position in the city for
Rukmani's third son. Rukmani's fourth son is killed stealing a calfskin from the
tannery. Kuti suffers the most from hunger, and Ira prostitutes herself to feed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ira</b></font>).
Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) efforts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ira</b></font>) dies. A good rice harvest arrives too late to save Rukmani's
sons. Kenny returns from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenny</b></font>) long absences with money raised to build a
hospital in the village. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenny</b></font>) offers to train Rukmani's remaining son, Selvam, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Selvam</b></font>)
assistant. Some villagers speculate that Kenny is kind to Rukmani because they have
an illicit relationship. Kunthi, a neighborhood wife who became a prostitute,
spreads this rumor out of spite. When they were both young, Nathan fathered Kunthi's
two sons. Kunthi uses this as leverage over them until Rukmani learns the truth and
forgives Nathan. Now, as Nathan nears fifty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) has no sons left to work the land.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) suffers from rheumatism and debilitating fevers. Rukmani and Ira try to help, but
they are not strong enough. Ira has a baby to care for, an albino boy conceived in
prostitution but loved nonetheless. The family experiences its greatest loss when
the land agent tells Nathan and Rukmani their land has been sold to the despised
tannery. No one else will lease land to a man as old and ill as Nathan, and Rukmani
and Nathan must leave their home of thirty years to go to their son Murugan in the
city. They leave Ira and their grandchild under Selvam's care. Their possessions reduced to the few bundles they carry, Nathan and Rukmani
try to find Murugan in the city. They rest one night at a temple, where thieves
steal their bundles and all their money. A leprous street urchin named Puli helps
them find the home of Kenny's doctor friend. They learn that Murugan has not worked
there for the past two years and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Murugan</b></font>) left the position for better wages at the
Collector's house. At the Collector's, Murugan's wife informs them that Murugan has
deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) older boy, their grandson, is thin with hunger. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) starving baby
is too little to be Murugan's son. Rukmani sees that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Nathan cannot impose
upon their daughter-in-law. They return to the temple, where food is distributed
each night to the destitute. Rukmani and Nathan dream of home but have no means to make the trip. Rukmani
tries to get work as a letter reader but earns only enough to buy rice cakes. Puli
takes them to a stone quarry where there is better-paying work. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) helps them learn
to break stones, and they come to rely on him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>). They entrust him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) with their earnings,
and, as they save, they begin to hope. One evening, Rukmani splurges on extra food
and toys for Puli and her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) grandson. When she (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) returns to Nathan at the temple, she (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
expects him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) to be angry, but instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) is violently ill. During a week of monsoon
rains, Nathan continues to work in the quarry despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) fevers and chills. One
evening, after she (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) gets paid, Rukmani begins to plan for a cart to take them home.
Hurrying to catch up with Nathan, she (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) collapsed in the mud in the street.
Kind strangers help carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) to the temple, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) dies in her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) arms after
reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) of their happiness together. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) death, Rukmani rashly promises
Puli his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) health if he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) returns to the country with her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), a promise Kenny and Selvam
will help her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) keep. She (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) introduces Puli to Selvam and Ira as the son she (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) and Nathan
adopted while they were away. Demonstrating both hope and compassion, Ira hastens to
prepare a meal for Puli, and Selvam promises his (<font color='blue'><b>Selvam</b></font>) mother they will manage.
