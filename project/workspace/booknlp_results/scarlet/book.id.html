with a long preamble about how the book came to be written. The
nameless narrator was the surveyor of the customhouse in Salem,
Massachusetts.  In the customhouse's attic, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) discovered a number
of documents, among them a manuscript that was bundled with a scarlet,
gold-embroidered patch of cloth in the shape of an <div class="bookquote">``A.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The manuscript,
the work of a past surveyor, detailed events that occurred some
two hundred years before the narrator's time. When the narrator
lost his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) customs post, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) decided to write a fictional account of
the events recorded in the manuscript. The Scarlet Letter is
the final product. The story begins in seventeenth-century Boston, then a
Puritan settlement. A young woman, Hester Prynne, is led from the
town prison with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) infant daughter, Pearl, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms and the
scarlet letter <div class="bookquote">``A''  (<font color='red'><b>Pearl</b></font>)</div>on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breast. A man in the crowd tells an elderly onlooker
that Hester is being punished for adultery. Hester's husband, a
scholar much older than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is, sent her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ahead to America, but he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>)
never arrived in Boston.  The consensus is that he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) has been lost
at sea. While waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, Hester has apparently had
an affair, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has given birth to a child. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will not reveal
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover's identity, however, and the scarlet letter, along with
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) public shaming, is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) punishment for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sin and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) secrecy.
On this day Hester is led to the town scaffold and harangued by
the town fathers, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again refuses to identify her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child's
father. The elderly onlooker is Hester's missing husband, who
is now practicing medicine and calling himself Roger Chillingworth.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) settles in Boston, intent on revenge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) reveals his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) true identity
to no one but Hester, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) has sworn to secrecy. Several years
pass. Hester supports herself by working as a seamstress, and Pearl
grows into a willful, impish child. Shunned by the community, they
live in a small cottage on the outskirts of Boston. Community officials attempt
to take Pearl away from Hester, but, with the help of Arthur Dimmesdale,
a young and eloquent minister, the mother and daughter manage to
stay together. Dimmesdale, however, appears to be wasting away and
suffers from mysterious heart trouble, seemingly caused by psychological
distress. Chillingworth attaches himself to the ailing minister
and eventually moves in with him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) can provide
his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) patient with round-the-clock care. Chillingworth also suspects
that there may be a connection between the minister's torments and
Hester's secret, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) begins to test Dimmesdale to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) can
learn. One afternoon, while the minister sleeps, Chillingworth discovers
a mark on the man's breast -LRB-the details of which are kept from the
reader-RRB-, which convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) suspicions are correct. Dimmesdale's psychological anguish deepens, and he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) invents new
tortures for himself. In the meantime, Hester's charitable deeds and
quiet humility have earned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) a reprieve from the scorn of the community.
One night, when Pearl is about seven years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) mother
are returning home from a visit to a deathbed when they encounter
Dimmesdale atop the town scaffold, trying to punish himself for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>) sins. Hester and Pearl join him (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>), and the three link hands. Dimmesdale
refuses Pearl's request that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) publicly the next
day, and a meteor marks a dull red <div class="bookquote">``A''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in the night sky. Hester
can see that the minister's condition is worsening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) resolves
to intervene. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) goes to Chillingworth and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) to stop adding
to Dimmesdale's self-torment. Chillingworth refuses. Hester arranges an encounter with Dimmesdale in the forest because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) is aware that Chillingworth has probably guessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) plans
to reveal his (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) identity to Dimmesdale. The former lovers decide to
flee to Europe, where they can live with Pearl as a family. They
will take a ship sailing from Boston in four days. Both feel a sense
of release, and Hester removes her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) scarlet letter and lets down
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) hair. Pearl, playing nearby, does not recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) mother without
the letter. The day before the ship is to sail, the townspeople
gather for a holiday and Dimmesdale preaches his (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>) most eloquent sermon
ever. Meanwhile, Hester has learned that Chillingworth knows of
their plan and has booked passage on the same ship. Dimmesdale,
leaving the church after his (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) sermon, sees Hester and Pearl standing
before the town scaffold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) impulsively mounts the scaffold with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) lover and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) daughter, and confesses publicly, exposing a scarlet
letter seared into the flesh of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) chest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) falls dead, as Pearl
kisses him (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>). Frustrated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>) revenge, Chillingworth dies a year later.
Hester and Pearl leave Boston, and no one knows what has happened
to them. Many years later, Hester returns alone, still wearing the
scarlet letter, to live in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) old cottage and resume her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
charitable work. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) receives occasional letters from Pearl, who
has married a European aristocrat and established a family of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
own. When Hester dies, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is buried next to Dimmesdale. The two
share a single tombstone, which bears a scarlet <div class="bookquote">``A.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div></body></html>
