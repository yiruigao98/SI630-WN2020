Walton, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole,
recounts to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walton</b></font>) sister back in England the progress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walton</b></font>) dangerous
mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by
seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Walton encounters Victor Frankenstein,
who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is
weakened by the cold. Walton takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Walton</b></font>) aboard ship, helps nurse
him (<font color='blue'><b>Walton</b></font>) back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster
that Frankenstein created. Victor first describes his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) early life in Geneva. At the
end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Elizabeth Lavenza
-LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) cousin in the 1818 edition, his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) adopted
sister in the 1831 edition-RRB- and friend Henry
Clerval, Victor enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural
philosophy and chemistry. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) is consumed by the desire to
discover the secret of life and, after several years of research,
becomes convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) has found it. Armed with the knowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) has long been seeking, Victor spends
months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One
climactic night, in the secrecy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) apartment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) brings his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>)
creation to life. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) looks at the monstrosity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) has created,
however, the sight horrifies him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>). After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted
by the specter of the monster looming over him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) runs into the
streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Victor runs into Henry,
who has come to study at the university, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) friend
back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) apartment. Though the monster is gone, Victor falls
into a feverish illness. Sickened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) horrific deed, Victor prepares to return
to Geneva, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) receives a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) father informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) youngest brother, William, has been murdered. Grief-stricken,
Victor hurries home. While passing through the woods where William
was strangled, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced
that the monster is his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) brother's murderer. Arriving in Geneva,
Victor finds that Justine Moritz, a kind, gentle girl who had been
adopted by the Frankenstein household, has been accused. She (<font color='blue'><b>Justine</b></font>) is
tried, condemned, and executed, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Justine</b></font>) assertions of innocence.
Victor grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster
he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent
loved ones. Hoping to ease his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) grief, Victor takes a vacation to the
mountains. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier,
the monster approaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>). The monster admits to the murder of William
but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) says
that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) struck out at William in a desperate attempt to injure Victor,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) cruel creator. The monster begs Victor to create a mate for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>), a monster equally grotesque to serve as his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) sole companion. Victor refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of
creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive,
however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) eventually convinces Victor. After returning to
Geneva, Victor heads for England, accompanied by Henry, to gather
information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Henry
in Scotland, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys
and works reluctantly at repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) first success. One night,
struck by doubts about the morality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) actions, Victor glances
out the window to see the monster glaring in at him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) with a frightening
grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) work, Victor
destroys his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) will be with Victor on Victor's wedding night. Later that night, Victor takes a boat out onto a lake
and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind
picks up and prevents him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) from returning to the island. In the morning,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) is arrested
and informed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) will be tried for a murder discovered the previous
night. Victor denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown
the body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) is shocked to behold his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) friend Henry Clerval, with
the mark of the monster's fingers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) neck. Victor falls ill,
raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) recovery, after
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) is acquitted of thecrime. Shortly after returning to Geneva with his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) father, Victor
marries Elizabeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) fears the monster's warning and suspects that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) will be murdered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) wedding night. To be cautious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) sends
Elizabeth away to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>). While he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) awaits the monster, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>)
hears Elizabeth scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting
at killing his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) new bride, not himself. Victor returns home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>)
father, who dies of grief a short time later. Victor vows to devote
the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) life to finding the monster and exacting his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) revenge,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) soon departs to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) quest. Victor tracks the monster ever northward into the ice.
In a dogsled chase, Victor almost catches up with the monster, but
the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap
between them. At this point, Walton encounters Victor, and the narrative
catches up to the time of Walton's fourth letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) sister. Walton tells the remainder of the story in another series
of letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walton</b></font>) sister. Victor, already ill when the two men meet,
worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Walton returns, several
days later, to the room in which the body lies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) is startled to
see the monster weeping over Victor. The monster tells Walton of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) asserts
that now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) creator has died, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) too can end his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) suffering.
The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die.
