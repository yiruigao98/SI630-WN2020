The group is at the Kenmore Hotel, swapping memories of Jack. Marcus narrates the novel, which is composed of stories he (<font color='blue'><b>Marcus</b></font>) has pieced together about Jack. Marcus meets Jack and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marcus</b></font>) brother, Eddie, in 1925. They are at the Kenmore, and Marcus butts into a conversation they are having about Al Jolson. Five years later, Jack invites Marcus to lunch and asks Marcus to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Marcus</b></font>) lawyer. Joe <div class="bookquote">``Speed''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe</b></font>)</div>Fogarty, Jack's right-hand man and driver, picks up Marcus and takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Marcus</b></font>) to Jimmy Biondo's farm in East Durham, which Jack rents and uses to store illegal booze. There Marcus meets Jack's wife, Alice, and the three of them take turns firing machine guns in the barn turned booze storage space. Afterward, they drive to Jack's farmhouse in Acra. Jack and Alice get in a fight over their canaries when Alice discovers that Jack calls one of them <div class="bookquote">``Marion''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>after a girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) has been seeing on the side. Fogarty, Jack, and Marcus leave and drive to Haines Falls in the Catskills to a place called The Top O' the Mountain House. There, Jack and Charlie Northrup, another prominent local gangster, get into a fight. Marcus also meets Marion <div class="bookquote">``Kiki''  (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div>Roberts, a Broadway dancer, whom Jack has been keeping at The Top O' the Mountain under the supervision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) small-minded, one-eyed strongman, The Goose. They all go aerial bowling and miniature golfing, and Marcus admires Kiki's physique. Later, Marcus overhears a conversation between Jack and Kiki in which Kiki sounds annoyed at being cooped up and frustrated that Jack will not dump Alice and marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) instead. Marcus accompanies Jack on a drug-run to Europe. Shortly after they leave, the news reaches their boat that Charlie Northrup's bloodstained car has been found in Brooklyn with one of Jack's men. Suddenly Jack and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) entourage are the stars of the ship. Jack has a fling with a librarian, but soon dumps her (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>). Before they reach Europe, the librarian tries to kill herself but does not succeed. As news of the unsuccessful search for Northrup's body reaches the ship, tension mounts. They receive word that Biondo, who has supplied the funds for the heroin deal, wants to back out. But Jack presses on and gives the money to Marcus to hide. Jack also wants Marcus to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) jewels, but Marcus refuses, so Jack dumps them overboard. Marcus has a one-night stand with a woman whose name he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) does not remember. When the ship reaches Europe, the press mobs Jack. Jack is turned away from Britain and Belgium, and detained in Germany. In Germany, Marcus finds Jack a local lawyer. They meet the lawyer for lunch, and the lawyer brings along his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) nephew, a semi-famous playwright named Weissberg who writes about small-time crooks. Weissberg tells Jack that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wants to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) back to the States, observe him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), and write a play about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Jack shoots a pistol between Weissberg's feet and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s just a stupid kid. Jack takes a freighter back to America. There are forty-five hundred canaries on board, and Jack is the only human passenger. Although the canaries are afraid of Jack at first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) makes friends with the birds and takes three of them home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Biondo starts threatening Marcus and Kiki, demanding that Jack return his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) money, which Jack never does. Marcus learns that Northrup visited Jack one night. Jack was angry because Northrup had tipped off federal agents about one of Jack's rum boats, so Jack proposed a partnership as a means of allowing Northrup to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) back. Northrup refused, and Jack had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) men beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) up. When Northrup fought back, The Goose shot and killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Jack had The Goose burn his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) body. Late in 1930, The Goose is ambushed at a bar and shot six times, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) does not die. Jack is shot five times at a hotel while Kiki is in the shower, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) survives. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) recovers, Jack keeps Kiki out of sight, and Alice takes care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) puts a crucifix over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bed and turns away the press when they ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) about Kiki. Marcus starts trying to bribe Upstate politicians for Jack, unsuccessfully. Alice has a <div class="bookquote">``Mormon''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>dream, about Jack bringing home another wife. Marcus brings a Broadway producer named Lew Edwards to see Jack and Alice at their home. The producer suggests that Jack pretend to have found religion, and start a preaching routine that they could take on tour around the country. The producer suggests that the nation would eat up the idea of one of its most notorious figures having a change of heart inspired by God. Jack thinks the idea is hypocritical. Alice finds out that Jack has been staying in touch with Kiki, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Kiki moves in with Jack, but is frustrated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) low sex drive. They sleep in separate rooms. One night Kiki walks into Jack's room, naked, to surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) strokes his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wakes suddenly, holding a gun to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face and bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fingers backward. Earlier that same night, they had run into a local bumpkin, Clem Streeter, moving some hard cider. Jack kidnapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) companion, a boy named Dickie Bartlett, and took them back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) farm. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) burned Streeter's foot and nearly hanged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), trying to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to say where his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) still was. Streeter claimed he (<font color='blue'><b>Streeter</b></font>) knew of no still. Finally, Jack let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) go, largely because Fogarty urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to do so. Jack is arrested, but is soon out on bail. Fogarty comes out of hiding to tell Jack that The Goose is looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). While they are at a bar, Jack is ambushed by two drive-by shooters, who hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) with four shotgun pellets. Fogarty gets him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to the hospital, but then Fogarty is picked up by the cops. Marcus refuses to take on Fogarty as a client, because Fogarty does not have the money to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>). Jack moves into a suite at the Kenmore with both Alice and Kiki. Alice and Kiki live in harmony and enjoy going shopping together. However, both of them have secretly enlisted the help of voodoo specialists to hex the other. Marcus goes out to dinner with them, and all night Alice and Kiki wonder who Jack will ask to dance first. Finally, Jack asks Kiki to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left -LRB-now paralyzed-RRB- arm, and Alice to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) right arm, and they all dance together. Jack goes through two trials. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wins the one in Troy, but loses the federal trial in Manhattan and is sentenced to four years in jail. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) takes back the Biondo-money from Marcus and tries to form a new gang, but that gang is soon busted up. Marcus joins Jack on a beer run, which ends at Packy Delaney's Parody Club. Flossie is there, and they drink and sing until it is reported that The Goose is parked across the street. They call the cops and hide out upstairs until the cops come to take Goose away. Left alone for a moment, Marcus and Flossie have sex on the floor while a huge rat with red eyes watches them. After Jack is acquitted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) second Troy Streeter trial, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) has a party at The Parody with fifty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) closest friends. Kiki is not there out of respect for Alice's feelings. After a while, Jack leaves to go see Kiki. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and Kiki have sex, Jack goes home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Albany apartment. That night he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is murdered by two gunmen who shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) three times in the head. Kiki and Alice both use their notoriety as Jack's women to create traveling stage shows. Kiki's show lasts longer, and Alice ends up hanging around Coney Island. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is murdered not too much later. The last time Marcus sees Kiki, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is performing in a strip tease show. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soon fades from the spotlight.
