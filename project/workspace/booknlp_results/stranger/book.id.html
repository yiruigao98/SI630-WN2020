a young man living in Algiers. After receiving a telegram informing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's death, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes a bus to Marengo, where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother
had been living in an old persons' home. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeps for almost the
entire trip. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrives, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speaks to the director of the home.
The director allows Meursault to see his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) mother, but Meursault finds that
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) body has already been sealed in the coffin. He (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) declines the caretaker's
offer to open the coffin. That night, Meursault keeps vigil over his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) mother's body.
Much to his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) displeasure, the talkative caretaker stays with him (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>)
the whole time. Meursault smokes a cigarette, drinks coffee, and
dozes off. The next morning, before the funeral, he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) meets with the
director again. The director informs him (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) that Thomas Perez, an old
man who had grown very close to Meursault's mother, will be attending the
funeral service. The funeral procession heads for the small local village,
but Perez has difficulty keeping up and eventually faints from the
heat. Meursault reports that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) remembers little of the funeral.
That night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) happily arrives back in Algiers. The next day, Meursault goes to the public beach for
a swim. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) runs into Marie Cardona, his (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) former co-worker.
The two make a date to see a comedy at the movie theater that evening.
After the movie they spend the night together. When Meursault wakes
up, Marie is gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) stays in bed until noon and then sits on his (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>)
balcony until evening, watching the people pass on the street. The following day, Monday, Meursault returns to work.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) has lunch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) friend Emmanuel and then works all afternoon. While
walking upstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) apartment that night, Meursault runs into
Salamano, an old man who lives in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) building and owns a mangy
dog. Meursault also runs into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbor, Raymond Sintes, who
is widely rumored to be a pimp. Raymond invites Meursault over for
dinner. Over the meal, Raymond recounts how he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) beat up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) mistress
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had been cheating on him (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>). As a result,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) got into a fight with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) brother. Raymond now wants to torment
his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) mistress even more, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) needs Meursault to write a letter
to lure his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) mistress back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>). Meursault agrees and writes the
letter that night. The following Saturday, Marie visits Meursault at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>)
apartment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) asks Meursault if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) replies that
<div class="bookquote">``it didn't mean anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but probably not. The two then hear shouting
coming from Raymond's apartment. They go out into the hall and watch
as a policeman arrives. The policeman slaps Raymond and says that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) will be summoned to the police station for beating up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) mistress. Later,
Raymond asks Meursault to testify on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) behalf, and Meursault agrees.
That night, Raymond runs into Salamano, who laments that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) dog
has run away. Marie asks Meursault if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) wants to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) replies
indifferently but says that they can get married if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) wants to,
so they become engaged. The following Sunday, Meursault, Marie,
and Raymond go to a beach house owned by Masson, one of Raymond's friends.
They swim happily in the ocean and then have lunch. That afternoon,
Masson, Raymond, and Meursault run into two Arabs on the beach,
one of whom is the brother of Raymond's mistress. A fight breaks
out and Raymond is stabbed. After tending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) wounds, Raymond
returns to the beach with Meursault. They find the Arabs at a spring.
Raymond considers shooting them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) gun, but Meursault talks
him (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) out of it and takes the gun away. Later, however, Meursault
returns to the spring to cool off, and, for no apparent reason,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) shoots Raymond's mistress's brother. Meursault is arrested and thrown into jail. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) lawyer
seems disgusted at Meursault's lack of remorse over his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) crime, and,
in particular, at Meursault's lack of grief at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) mother's funeral.
Later, Meursault meets with the examining magistrate, who cannot
understand Meursault's actions. The magistrate brandishes a crucifix
and demands that Meursault put his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) faith in God. Meursault refuses, insisting
that he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) does not believe in God. The magistrate cannot accept Meursault's
lack of belief, and eventually dubs him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Antichrist.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>One day, Marie visits Meursault in prison. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) forces
herself to smile during the visit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) expresses hope that Meursault
will be acquitted and that they will get married. As he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) awaits his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>)
trial, Meursault slowly adapts to prison life. His (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) isolation from
nature, women, and cigarettes torments him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) at first, but he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) eventually adjusts
to living without them, and soon does not even notice their absence.
He (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) manages to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) mind occupied, and he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) sleeps for most of
each day. Meursault is taken to the courthouse early on the morning
of his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) trial. Spectators and members of the press fill the courtroom.
The subject of the trial quickly shifts away from the murder to
a general discussion of Meursault's character, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) reaction
to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mother's death in particular. The director and several other
people who attended the vigil and the funeral are called to testify,
and they all attest to Meursault's lack of grief or tears. Marie
reluctantly testifies that the day after his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mother's funeral she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
and Meursault went on a date and saw a comedic movie. During his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
summation the following day, the prosecutor calls Meursault a monster
and says that his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) lack of moral feeling threatens all of society.
Meursault is found guilty and is sentenced to death by beheading. Meursault returns to prison to await his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) execution. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
struggles to come to terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) situation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has trouble
accepting the certainty and inevitability of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) fate. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) imagines
escaping and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) dreams of filing a successful legal appeal. One
day, the chaplain comes to visit against Meursault's wishes. He (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>)
urges Meursault to renounce his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) atheism and turn to God, but Meursault
refuses. Like the magistrate, the chaplain cannot believe that Meursault
does not long for faith and the afterlife. Meursault suddenly becomes enraged,
grabs the chaplain, and begins shouting at him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) declares that
he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) is correct in believing in a meaningless, purely physical world.
For the first time, Meursault truly embraces the idea that human
existence holds no greater meaning. He (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) abandons all hope for the
future and accepts the <div class="bookquote">``gentle indifference of the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>This
acceptance makes Meursault feel happy.
