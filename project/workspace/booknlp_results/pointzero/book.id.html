experiences as a psychiatrist in Egypt, studying the psychological effects of prison
on female prisoners. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) states in her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) introduction that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) was
conducting these studies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) had no idea that one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) would be
imprisoned by the government. On one visit to Qanatir prison, Nawal
meets a doctor who tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) that there is a prisoner there who is truly remarkable.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) is awaiting the death penalty for killing a man, but the doctor cannot believe
that this woman is capable of killing anyone. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wrote out a request for a pardon,
but the condemned woman refused to sign it. Nawal desperately wants to meet with
this woman, named Firdaus, but Firdaus keeps refusing to meet with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>).
Finally, the day before she (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) is to be put to death, Firdaus agrees to meet with
Nawal. Nawal goes to Firdaus's cell, and Firdaus commands her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) to sit on the ground.
Firdaus begins to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) life story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) was born into an extremely poor family in
the countryside. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) father often beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) mother; sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) as well.
Firdaus used to play in the fields with other children. A boy named Mohammadain was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) special playmate, and when they were young, they used to play <div class="bookquote">``bride and
bridegroom.''  (<font color='red'><b>boy playmate</b></font>)</div>Firdaus got pleasure from her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) sexual experiments with Mohammadain. One
day, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) mother performed a clitoridectomy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>), and after that, Firdaus is no
longer allowed to play with Mohammadain, nor does she (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) ever feel sexual pleasure in
the same way. Soon, Firdaus's mother and father die, and Firdaus is sent to live
with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uncle, a sometime scholar, who lives in Cairo. At first, everything goes well for Firdaus in Cairo. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uncle get
along well, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is allowed to go to school, which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loves. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uncle
share a bed and are close. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uncle gets married and the new wife does not like
Firdaus, so Firdaus is sent to a boarding school. Firdaus is an excellent student
and works hard. Unlike the other girls, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not fantasize about boys and
marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spends most of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) time at the library and in the courtyard, where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
encounters a teacher named Miss Iqbal, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forms a friendship. When
Firdaus graduates, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is given an award, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family are not at the
ceremony, so Miss Iqbal accepts it for Firdaus. When school is over, Firdaus's uncle
comes to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>). Back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) uncle's house, Firdaus is miserable. One night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) overhears her (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>)
aunt and uncle discussing whether they will marry Firdaus to her (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) aunt's old uncle,
Sheikh Mahmoud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>) is sixty and has a facial deformity. Firdaus runs away, but while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) is on the streets, she (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) is terrified by the strange men who approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>)
returns home. They marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) to Sheikh Mahmoud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mahmoud</b></font>) is selfish and stingy and beats
Firdaus. His (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>) facial deformity is a large swelling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>) chin with a hole in the
middle that leaks pus. After one bad beating, Firdaus runs away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) ends up in a
coffee shop, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) meets Bayoumi, the coffee shop owner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) goes with him (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>) apartment. At first Bayoumi is kind to Firdaus. Then Firdaus announces that she (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>)
wants to get a job, and Bayoumi is enraged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>) beats her (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) and begins to lock her (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>) in
the apartment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>) leaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>) brings his (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>) friends home and allows them to have sex
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Iqbal</b></font>). Firdaus escapes with the help of a neighbor and flees Bayoumi's apartment
for the city. Resting by the Nile, Firdaus feels hopeless until an wealthy-looking woman
approaches her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name is Sharifa, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a prostitute. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) takes Firdaus in
and teaches her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to become a high-class prostitute. Sharifa makes money from
Firdaus's body until one night when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friend Fawzy comes over. Firdaus overhears
Sharifa and Fawzy fighting over who will get to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) runs away again.
Still a prostitute, Firdaus becomes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own boss and eventually has a beautiful home
and expensive things. One night, a client named Di'aa tells her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not a
respectable woman, and Firdaus is devastated. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gives up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nice apartment and
beautiful things, moves into a shack, and begins working as an office assistant.
There, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) realizes that the life of an assistant is in many ways worse than the
life of a prostitute. She (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) meets a man named Ibrahim, and falls in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ibrahim</b></font>).
They have a relationship, and Firdaus begins to feel that the world is not so
horrible, until she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) discovers that Ibrahim has become engaged to the boss's
daughter. Firdaus leaves the company and becomes a prostitute again. She (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) is very
expensive and very popular. Many powerful men come to her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) turns some of
them away to prove that she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) has power over her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) own body, and because she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) despises
them. Ibrahim comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Ibrahim</b></font>) never loved her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>); rather, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ibrahim</b></font>) just
wanted free sex. A pimp tries to take over Firdaus's life, and for a little while,
she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) lets him (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>). Then they fight and she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>). Shortly after that, Firdaus meets
an Arab prince who takes her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) home and offers her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) $3,000. She (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) sleeps with him (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>), rips
up the money, and slaps him (<font color='blue'><b>Firdaus</b></font>). Terrified, the man calls the police. They come and
arrest Firdaus. Firdaus is tried and sentenced to death. She (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) is, she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) tells Nawal, just waiting to die, because she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) is excited to go
somewhere new. She (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) knows that the men who sentenced her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) want to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) because
they're afraid of the truth she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) has to tell, not because they're afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>)'ll kill
again. After she (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) finishes her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) story, police come to her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) cell and take her (<font color='blue'><b>prostitute</b></font>) away to be
executed. Nawal leaves the cell and is ashamed of the world. Everywhere she (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) looks,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) sees lies and unhappiness. As Nawal drives away from the prison, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) thinks
about running people over with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) car, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) doesn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) realizes that Firdaus
is braver than she (<font color='blue'><b>Nawal</b></font>) is.
