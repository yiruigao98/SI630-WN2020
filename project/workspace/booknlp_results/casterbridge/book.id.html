his wife, Susan, looking for employment as a hay-trusser. When they
stop to eat, Henchard gets drunk, and in an auction that begins
as a joke but turns serious, he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) sells his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) wife and their baby daughter,
-Elizabeth-Jane, to Newson, a sailor, for five guineas. In the morning,
Henchard regrets what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>) has done and searches the town for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>)
wife and daughter. Unable to find them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>) goes into a church and
swears an oath that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>) will not drink alcohol for twenty-one years,
the same number of years he (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>) has been alive. After the sailor's death, eighteen years later, Susan
and Elizabeth-Jane seek Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>) is
merely a long-lost relative. They arrive in Casterbridge and learn
that Henchard is the mayor. The parents meet and decide that in
order to prevent Elizabeth-Jane from learning of their disgrace,
Henchard will court and remarry Susan as though they had met only
recently. Meanwhile, Henchard has hired Donald Farfrae, a young Scotchman,
as the new manager of his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) corn business. Elizabeth-Jane is intrigued
by Farfrae, and the two begin to spend time together. Henchard becomes
alienated from Farfrae, however, as the younger man consistently
outdoes Henchard in every respect. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks Farfrae to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
business and to stop courting Elizabeth-Jane. Susan falls ill and dies soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) remarriage to
Henchard. After discovering that Elizabeth-Jane is not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own daughter,
but Newson's, Henchard becomes increasingly cold toward her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). Elizabeth-Jane
then decides to leave Henchard's house and live with a lady who
has just arrived in town. This lady turns out to be Lucetta Templeman,
a woman with whom Henchard was involved during Susan's absence;
having learned of Susan's death, Lucetta has come to Casterbridge
to marry Henchard. While Lucetta is waiting for Henchard to call on her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) meets Farfrae, who has come to call on Elizabeth-Jane. The two
hit it off and are eventually married. Lucetta asks Henchard to
return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) all the letters she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) has sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>). On his (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) way to deliver
the letters, the messenger, Jopp, stops at an inn. The peasants
there convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) to open and read the letters aloud. Discovering
that Lucetta and Henchard have been romantically involved, the peasants
decide to hold a <div class="bookquote">``skimmity-ride,''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasants</b></font>)</div>a humiliating parade portraying
Lucetta and Henchard together. The event takes place one afternoon
when Farfrae is away. Lucetta faints upon seeing the spectacle and becomes
very ill. Shortly afterward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) dies. While Henchard has grown to hate Farfrae, he (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) has grown
closer to Elizabeth-Jane. The morning after Lucetta's death, Newson,
who is actually still alive, arrives at Henchard's door and asks
for Elizabeth-Jane. Henchard tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) is dead, and Newson leaves
in sorrow. Elizabeth-Jane stays with Henchard and also begins to
spend more time with Farfrae. One day, Henchard learns that Newson
has returned to town, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>) decides to leave rather than risk another
confrontation. Elizabeth-Jane is reunited with Newson and learns
of Henchard's deceit; Newson and Farfrae start planning the wedding
between Elizabeth-Jane and the Scotchman. Henchard comes back to Casterbridge on the night of the
wedding to see Elizabeth-Jane, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) snubs him (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>) leaves again,
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newson</b></font>) will not return. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) soon regrets her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) coldness,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) and Farfrae, her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) new husband, go looking for Henchard so
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) can make her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) peace. Unfortunately, they find him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) too late,
discovering that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has died alone in the countryside. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has left
a will: his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dying wish is to be forgotten.
