ten-year-old Frieda MacTeer live in Lorain, Ohio, with their parents.
It is the end of the Great Depression, and the girls' parents are
more concerned with making ends meet than with lavishing attention
upon their daughters, but there is an undercurrent of love and stability
in their home. The MacTeers take in a boarder, Henry Washington,
and also a young girl named Pecola. Pecola's father has tried to
burn down his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) family's house, and Claudia and Frieda feel sorry
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>). Pecola loves Shirley Temple, believing that whiteness is
beautiful and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) is ugly. Pecola moves back in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) family, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) life is
difficult. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) father drinks, her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) mother is distant, and the two
of them often beat one another. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) brother, Sammy, frequently runs
away. Pecola believes that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) had blue eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) would be loved
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) life would be transformed. Meanwhile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) continually receives
confirmation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) own sense of ugliness--the grocer looks right
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) buys candy, boys make fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>), and a light-skinned girl,
Maureen, who temporarily befriends her (<font color='blue'><b>Maureen</b></font>) makes fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maureen</b></font>) too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maureen</b></font>)
is wrongly blamed for killing a boy's cat and is called a <div class="bookquote">``nasty little
black bitch''  (<font color='red'><b>boy cat</b></font>)</div>by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother. We learn that Pecola's parents have both had difficult
lives. Pauline, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) mother, has a lame foot and has always felt
isolated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) loses herself in movies, which reaffirm her (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) belief
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) is ugly and that romantic love is reserved for the beautiful.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) encourages her (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) husband's violent behavior in order to reinforce
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) own role as a martyr. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) feels most alive when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) is at work,
cleaning a white woman's home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) loves this home and despises
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>) own. Cholly, Pecola's father, was abandoned by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) parents and
raised by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) great aunt, who died when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a young teenager.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was humiliated by two white men who found him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) having sex for
the first time and made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continue while they watched. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ran
away to find his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father but was rebuffed by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
met Pauline, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a wild and rootless man. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feels trapped in
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marriage and has lost interest in life. Cholly returns home one day and finds Pecola washing
dishes. With mixed motives of tenderness and hatred that are fueled
by guilt, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rapes her (<font color='blue'><b>Pauline</b></font>). When Pecola's mother finds her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unconscious
on the floor, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) disbelieves Pecola's story and beats her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Pecola
goes to Soaphead Church, a sham mystic, and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for blue eyes. Instead
of helping her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uses her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to kill a dog he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dislikes. Claudia and Frieda find out that Pecola has been impregnated
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) father, and unlike the rest of the neighborhood, they want
the baby to live. They sacrifice the money they have been saving
for a bicycle and plant marigold seeds. They believe that if the
flowers live, so will Pecola's baby. The flowers refuse to bloom,
and Pecola's baby dies when it is born prematurely. Cholly, who
rapes Pecola a second time and then runs away, dies in a workhouse.
Pecola goes mad, believing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) cherished wish has been fulfilled
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) has the bluest eyes.
