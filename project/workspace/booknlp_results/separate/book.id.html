a quiet, intellectual student at the Devon School in New Hampshire.
During the summer session of 1942, he (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) becomes close friends with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) daredevil roommate Finny, whose innate charisma consistently allows
him (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) to get away with mischief. Finny prods Gene into making a dangerous
jump out of a tree into a river, and the two start a secret society
based on this ritual. Gene gradually begins to envy Finny's astonishing
athletic abilities, manifested in Finny's breaking a school swimming
record on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) first try. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) thinks that Finny, in turn, envies his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>)
superior academic achievements, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) suspects that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) friend
has been taking steps to distract him (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) studies. Gene's suspicions
transform into resentful hatred, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) nevertheless carefully maintains
an appearance of friendship. Gene realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) has been grievously mistaken about
the existence of any rivalry between them when, one day, Finny expresses
a sincere desire to see Gene succeed. While still in a state of shock
from the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) realization, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) accompanies Finny to the tree
for their jumping ritual. When Finny reaches the edge of the branch,
Gene's knees bend, shaking the branch and causing Finny to fall
to the bank and shatter his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) leg. The tragedy is generally considered
an accident, and no one thinks to blame Gene--especially not Finny.
But when the doctor tells Gene that Finny's athletic days are over,
Gene feels a piercing sense of guilt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) goes to see Finny and begins
to admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) part in Finny's fall, but the doctor interrupts him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and
Finny is sent home before Gene gets another chance to confess. The summer session ends, and Gene goes home to the South
for a brief vacation. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) way back to school, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) stops by Finny's house
and explains to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) friend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) shook the branch on purpose.
Finny refuses to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>), and Gene rescinds his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) confession and
continues on to school. There, Gene attempts to avoid true athletic
activity by becoming assistant manager of the crew team, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>)
feuds with the crew manager and quits. World War II is in full swing
and the boys at Devon are all eager to enlist in the military. Brinker
Hadley, a prominent class politician, suggests to Gene that they
enlist together, and Gene agrees. That night, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) finds Finny
has returned to school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) consequently abandons his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) plans to enlist,
as does Brinker. Finny expects Gene to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) place as the school's
sports star now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) is injured. When Gene protests that sports
no longer seem important in the midst of the war, Finny declares
that the war is nothing but a conspiracy to keep young men from
eclipsing the older authorities. Finny tells Gene that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) once had aspirations to go to
the Olympics, and Gene agrees to train for the 1944 Olympics in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) place. All the boys are surprised when a gentle, nature-loving
boy named Leper Lepellier becomes the first one in their class to
enlist. Gene and Finny go on training, shielded within their private
vision of world events. During a winter carnival, which Finny has
organized, a telegram arrives for Gene from Leper, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>)
has <div class="bookquote">``escaped''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and desperately needs Gene to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) home in
Vermont. Gene goes to Vermont and finds that Leper has gone slightly mad.
Leper, who was present at Finny's accident, reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) knows
the truth about what happened. Leper's ranting frightens Gene and
makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) anxious about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) himself might react to military life.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) runs away back to Devon. When Brinker hears of what has happened
to Leper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leper</b></font>) laments in front of Finny that Devon has already lost
two of its potential soldiers--Leper and the crippled Finny. Gene,
afraid that Finny will be hurt by this remark, tries to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>)
spirits by getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) to discuss his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) conspiracy theory again, but
Finny now denies the war only ironically. Brinker, who has harbored suspicions that Gene might have
been partly responsible for Finny's accident, wants to prove or
disprove them definitively. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) organizes an after-hours tribunal
of schoolboys and has Gene and Finny summoned without warning. The boys
on the makeshift tribunal question the two about the circumstances
surrounding the fall. Finny's perceptions of the incident remain
so blurred that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) cannot speak conclusively on the matter; Gene
maintains that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) doesn't remember the details of it. The boys now
bring in Leper, who was sighted earlier in the day skulking about
the bushes, and Leper begins to implicate Gene. Finny declares that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) does not care about the facts and rushes out of the room. Hurrying
on the stairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) falls and breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) leg again. Gene sneaks over to the school's infirmary that night
to see Finny, who angrily sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) away. Gene wanders the campus
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) falls asleep under the football stadium. The next morning,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) goes to see Finny again, takes full blame for the tragedy, apologizes,
and tries to explain that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) action did not arise from hatred.
Finny accepts these statements and the two are reconciled. Later,
as the doctor is operating on Finny's leg, some marrow detaches
from the bone and enters Finny's bloodstream, going directly to
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) heart and killing him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). Gene receives the news with relative
tranquility; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) feels that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) has become a part of Finny and will
always be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>). The rest of the boys graduate and go off to
enlist in relatively safe branches of the military. Gene reflects
on the constant enmity that plagues the human heart--a curse from
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gene</b></font>) believes that only Finny was immune.
