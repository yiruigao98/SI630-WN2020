The book is framed around her main frustration with feeling like she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) belongs to no group, that she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) is disconnected with the world around her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>). The daughter of a jeweler and a mother who died in child birth, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is highly precocious and stubborn, but also na√Øve and unaware of the reasons for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own emotions. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spends the main action of the book, which begins on the last Friday in August and ends two days later, obsessed with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother Jarvis's wedding on Sunday to Janice Evans. As the story begins, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) expresses her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fears, anxiety and confusion about marriage to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) housekeeper, Berenice and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) six-year-old cousin, John Henry. Berenice passes off her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) feelings as masked jealousy. Frankie later asks John Henry to sleep over, claiming he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looks scared. However, as we know, Frankie is really the one who feels that way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) is relieved to have a person to sleep next to, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) used to sleep next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) father, until he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) recently said she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) was too old. In the first part of the novella, the narrator describes the following Saturday morning, but then skips right to the early evening of that day. Only in the second part does McCullers return to Saturday afternoon to describe the events that took place. Before then, we are given a lot of character background about Frankie. We hear about her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) various attempts to become more worldly, to pay attention to things like the fact that World War II rages all around her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>). Through her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) various brushes with sexual experiences, we discover how completely unaware of the facts of life she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) is. Eventually, Frankie has a revelation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) belongs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankie</b></font>) future wife, saying, <div class="bookquote">``They are the we of me.''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>When the narration returns back to Saturday afternoon, we find that Frankie has changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) name to F. Jasmine in an attempt to both sound more grown up and to have a name which begins in J A, just like Janice and Jarvis. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) tours the town telling people of her (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) plans to run away with the newly-weds the following evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) expects everyone to notice the sudden change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) has shed her (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) childhood persona. However, her (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) father takes no notice and treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) as the same little girl. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) stops in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) jewelry shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) that Uncle Charles has died and she (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) tries to react in a mature manner. Walking down the street again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) encounters a Soldier and has a stilted conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) at a local bar, eventually agreeing to have a proper date with him (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) later that evening. Returning home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) sits down to eat a lengthy dinner with Berenice and John Henry. The three of them launch into a frank and heart felt conversation about love. Berenice tells of her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) four marriages and cautions F. Jasmine not to be delusional about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) prospects of joining up with Janice and Jarvis after the wedding. They discuss what they would do were they God and could change the world to their liking. John Henry imagines a world make of good things to eat. Berenice sees a place where there is no distinction between black and white. F. Jasmine imagines that boys could change into girls and vice versa, at will. Eventually, F. Jasmine and Berenice come to a poignant understanding of the societal pitfalls of race differences. F. Jasmine leaves the house Saturday evening and travels to Big Mama's house to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) fortune told. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) learns that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) will indeed take a journey the next day, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) will eventually return. Discouraged, F. Jasmine goes to meet the soldier at the bar. They sit down for a drink and eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) coerces her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) hotel room where he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) attempts to have sex with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) hits him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) over the head with a pitcher and flees back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) house. The wedding turns out to be a bust for the newly dubbed <div class="bookquote">``Frances.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) pleads to run off with Janice and Jarvis, entirely in vain. Dejected and depressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) returns home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) hopes dashed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) attempts to run away, stealing her (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) father's pistol, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) is quickly found by the police and returned home. In a speedy denouement, McCullers describes the next three months. In that time, much changes for Frances. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) finds a new friend, Mary Littlejohn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Janice</b></font>) father get ready to move. Berenice decides to quit and get married again. John Henry dies of meningitis.
