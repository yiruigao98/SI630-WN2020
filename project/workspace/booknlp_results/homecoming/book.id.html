When they have driven about half the distance between their home in Provincetown and Bridgeport, Momma stops the car and gets out, telling the three younger children, James, Maybeth, and Sammy to mind Dicey. Their Momma does not return, and the next day the children, under Dicey's determined leadership, set out to walk to Bridgeport, with only a map, a change of underwear, and seven dollars. The children walk for days on end, buying food as cheaply as possible, scrounging for change alongside of the road, and sleeping in or near empty houses. After several days, they stop to rest in a state park, where clams, mussels, and fish abound, and they meet a young runaway couple, Edie and Louis. In the park, Sammy, to Dicey's dismay, steals both food and money, and they leave in a fright when the police begin looking for them. By the time they reach the Connecticut River, they are completely out of money. Dicey decides to earn money by washing windows, and soon has the children carrying bags in the parking lot of a grocery store. Before long, they have enough money to continue on. They cross the forbidding river in a rowboat, and continue on towards the west. When they reach New Haven, however, they are once again out of money, and Dicey is near despair. A couple of Yale students, Stewart and Windy befriend them, take them in for the night, and feed them. That night, James steals twenty dollars from their benefactors, which he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) grudgingly returns the next morning. Dicey chastises him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) severely, and Stewart talks seriously to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) about the moral implications of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) actions. The next day, Stewart drives them to Bridgeport, leaving them at their aunt's door. The children find that Aunt Cilla is dead, and their fussy and pious cousin, Eunice, occupies the house alone. Eunice takes the children in, and soon the three younger children are attending a church camp every day while Dicey helps Eunice care for the house. Dicey also begins to earn money by washing windows around town. In Bridgeport, Dicey talks to the police about Momma's disappearance, and before long, the police have located her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) is comatose in a mental hospital in Boston. The Tillerman children are unhappy in Bridgeport. Sammy gets in fights, upsetting Eunice, the nuns want to label Maybeth as retarded and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) special schooling, and Dicey feels the children growing apart from one another. When Eunice decides to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) dream of becoming a nun and adopt the children--although she (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) still considers handing the belligerent Sammy over to the state--Dicey acts quickly. While in Bridgeport, they have learned of their grandmother, Abigail Tillerman, who lives in Crisfield, Maryland, and Dicey decides they must meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Abigail</b></font>). Dicey and her (<font color='blue'><b>Abigail</b></font>) siblings leave without Eunice's permission, boarding a bus one morning for New York. They eventually take a bus to Wilmington, where Dicey panics when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) finds they have missed the bus to Crisfield and buys tickets for Annapolis, worried that Eunice may have the police looking for them. In Annapolis, they convince two boys, Tom and Jerry to sail them across the bay, and during the trip, Dicey falls in love with sailing. Once across, Dicey, determined to save money for a possible return trip, decides they must walk again. They find a circus and befriend the proprietor, Will. After a couple of days, they see signs advertising work picking tomatoes, and Dicey and the children approach a local farmer, Rudyard, asking for work. The children sense the man's untrustworthiness, but work through the morning. By the time evening comes, they are sure the man means them harm, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulls up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) truck, they dash away into the night, crossing a nearby river. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursues, but soon gives up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chase. The next day, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds them in a nearby town and pursues them hotly. The circus has come to the town, however, and Will protects the Tillermans from the evil man. The Tillermans spend the next several days with the circus, and Will offers to drive them to Crisfield when the circus moves to a town near it. When they finally arrive in Crisfield, Will wants to stay and make sure the children are all right, but Dicey explains they must face this challenge alone. The children find their belligerent and eccentric grandmother on a run-down farm seven miles outside of town. The grandmother agrees to let them stay the night, but adamantly refuses to let them stay for good. Dicey and the others, however, start to fall in love with their grandmother's beautiful farm on the shore, and Dicey has found an old sailboat in the barn, which she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) is determined to use. The children decide that they will start doing work around the farm, postponing their departure one day at a time until their grandmother gets used to them. The children work diligently for about five days, until Will pays a visit, bringing the children used bicycles as a gift. That night, however, their grandmother explodes when Sammy rides off without permission and Dicey refuses to allow their grandmother to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) by sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) to bed without supper. When Dicey resignedly asks if they can stay, their grandmother refuses. That night, Dicey finds her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) grandmother writing a letter to Eunice in the kitchen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) takes this opportunity to explain to Dicey the reasons she (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) cannot take the children in: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) has little money and no income, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) cherishes the freedom and independence she (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) gained when her (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) stern husband died four years ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) is afraid of repeating the mistakes she (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) made as a mother that drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) children away. Dicey's grandmother admits to Dicey, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) likes the children and wants them to stay. The next morning, their grandmother seems to remember little of her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) proclamation of the night before, and several days later, she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) takes the children to town to register for school, explaining that it may take weeks for Eunice to write back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) letter, expressing whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) will take the children back. At school, Maybeth passes a test allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) to study in the third grade, much to the joy of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) family members. As they are preparing to return home, Dicey realizes her (<font color='blue'><b>Eunice</b></font>) grandmother has forgotten to mail the letter to Eunice. She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) reminds her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) grandmother of the letter, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) can get to the letterbox, Dicey stops her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>), telling her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) should take the children in, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) does not want to. To her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) surprise, her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) grandmother agrees, stating in mock exasperation that the children have worn her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) down. Overjoyed, the five return home together, united in their sense of hope and relief.
