Out of the song, the action of the play begins quickly. Clive returns home after spending the day managing the troubles among local tribes. Betty greets him (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) and they swap stories about their days' experiences. When Clive learns that Joshua has been rude to Betty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) scolds Joshua. After this scolding, Clive greets the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) family, asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) children about their daily activities. After some pleasant discussion, the family welcomes Harry Bagley and Mrs. Saunders. Harry, an explorer, visits the family between expeditions. Mrs. Saunders, a widow, arrives exhausted, seeking protection from the natives. Betty and Harry flirt, revealing their attraction for one another. Later, Harry asks Joshua to have sex with him (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>), and they leave for the barn together. Clive chases Mrs. Saunders away from the house, and, after a brief argument, performs oral sex on her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>). To escape suspicion, they quickly return to the family's Christmas picnic, where Clive toasts the Queen. Clive and Harry toss a ball with Edward until Clive becomes frustrated with Edward's clumsiness. The game of ball gives way to a game of hide and seek, during which Edward and Harry reveal that they have a sexual history. Edward hopes to rekindle this relationship, but Harry is hesitant to approve. Meanwhile, Ellen professes her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) love for Betty. Betty, still smitten with Harry, dismisses Ellen's comments as ridiculous. Later, Clive and the men flog the natives as the women wait inside the house. Mrs. Saunders, disapproving, leaves to find out what exactly the men are doing. Ellen becomes angry with Edward for playing with a doll and slaps him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). When Clive returns from the flogging, Edward apologizes for playing with the doll and asks his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) father for forgiveness. When all but Betty and Clive leave for the verandah, Clive tells Betty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) knows about her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) affair with Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) lectures her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) on the necessity to resist lust, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) forgives her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>). As tension grows among the natives, Clive finds a moment alone with Harry to tell Harry about the increasing dangers. Harry makes a pass at Clive, and Clive reacts with horror, offended by Harry's homosexuality. Seeking a cure for Harry's perversity, Clive attempts to marry Harry to Mrs. Saunders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) refuses the offer. News that Joshua's parents have been killed by British troops distracts Clive momentarily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) offers his (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) condolences to Joshua. When Clive turns his (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) attention back to Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) forces an engagement between Harry and Ellen. At the wedding party that follows, Mrs. Saunders announces that she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) is leaving, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) can exit, Clive kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>), prompting a fight between Mrs. Saunders and Betty. Disgusted at Mrs. Saunders behavior, Clive kicks her (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>) out of the house. When Clive goes to toast the newly engaged couple, Joshua raises a gun to shoot Clive. Edward sees this action, but does not warn Clive. Roughly one hundred years later, Victoria appears in a London park on a winter afternoon with Lin and Lin's daughter Cathy. When Cathy exits to play elsewhere, Lin informs Victoria that she (<font color='blue'><b>Victoria</b></font>) is a lesbian, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Victoria</b></font>) asks Victoria to go to a movie with her (<font color='blue'><b>Victoria</b></font>). Edward, now a gardener, joins the two women, followed by Betty, who rambles at length about raising children. Betty also mentions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) is considering leaving Clive. Betty lets Cathy play with her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) jewelry. -LRB-Note: For the second act of the play, which takes place in London, actors switch roles. For instance, Betty in London is played by a different actor than Betty in Africa. See Characters.-RRB- In the spring, Edward's lover Gerry comes to the park, where they argue about Gerry's lack of commitment. Gerry tells the audience about an affair he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerry</b></font>) had with a stranger on a train. Victoria returns to the park with her (<font color='blue'><b>Victoria</b></font>) husband Martin, who speaks at length about sex and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) desire to please Victoria. Lin enters when Martin leaves and tells Victoria that her (<font color='blue'><b>Victoria</b></font>) brother, a soldier, has died in Belfast. When Lin and Cathy get into a fight, they lose track of Victoria's son Tommy. A brief panic ensues before they find him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>). Gerry and Edward return, and Gerry breaks up with Edward. Later, on a summer night, Lin, Victoria, and Edward come to the park to hold a ceremony for a sex goddess. Martin arrives, looking for Victoria, and they pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) into the beginnings of an orgy. Moments later, Lin's dead brother appears and relates the experience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lin</b></font>) service in the army. Lin collapses when her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) brother disappears. Characters from Africa begin to make brief appearances, interacting with the London characters. By late summer, Lin, Victoria, and Edward have moved in together. Betty has rediscovered the joy of masturbation. Gerry and Edward reconcile and make plans to go out some time. On a trip to get ice cream, the Dead Hand Gang assaults Cathy, bloodying her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) nose. Martin and Lin fight over who was supposed to be looking after Cathy. All but Gerry and Betty leave. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) discussion with Gerry, Betty comes to terms with the fact that Edward is homosexual. Betty from Africa returns and embraces the new Betty.
