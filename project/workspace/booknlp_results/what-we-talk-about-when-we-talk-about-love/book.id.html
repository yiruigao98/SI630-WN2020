The narrator and Mel are sitting around Mel's kitchen table in Albuquerque, New Mexico, drinking gin with their wives, Laura and Terri. They begin talking about love. Mel thinks love is spiritual and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) used to be in the seminary. Terri says that before she (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>) lived with Mel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>) lived with a man named Ed who tried to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>) so much. Mel disagrees that Ed felt any love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>), but Terri says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) did. Mel tells the narrator and Laura that Ed had also threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) and Terri. The narrator holds Laura's hand and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) doesn't really know whether that's love, while Laura says that you can never know about other people's situations. Terri says Ed took rat poison when she (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) survived. Mel says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'s dead now. Terri says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) shot himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``bungled it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The narrator describes Mel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'s forty-five, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) movements are usually precise when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) hasn't been drinking. The narrator asks how Ed bungled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) suicide, but Mel merely replies that Ed was always threatening him (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) and Terri. Laura asks again what happened with the suicide, and Mel says that when Ed shot himself, someone heard it and called an ambulance, and Ed lived for three days. Terri says she (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>) was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) died and that Ed died for love. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>) admits that she (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>) and Mel were scared when Ed was threatening them and that Mel had even made a will. Mel opens another bottle of gin. The narrator, meanwhile, describes his (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) wife, Laura. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)'s a legal secretary, younger than the narrator, and seemingly very compatible with him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>). Laura says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) and the narrator, whose name is Nick, know all about love. Nick kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hand. Terri asks them how long they've been together, and Laura tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) that they've been together for about eighteen months. They all toast to love. A dog barks outside, and the sun is bright in the kitchen. Mel says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'ll give them an example of love but then says that no one knows anything about love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) loves Terri, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) first wife, Marjorie, too, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) hates her (<font color='blue'><b>Marjorie</b></font>) now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) wants to know what happened to the love he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) felt for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) first wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) points out that Nick and Laura love each other but loved other people before they met and were each married to someone else before as well. Mel says that if something happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) or Terri, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) knows that whoever remained would find someone else to love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) admits that that's a horrible thing to say but asks the others to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'s wrong. Terri asks Mel whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'s drunk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) can say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'s thinking without being drunk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) says they're all just talking, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'s not on call. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) tells Laura and Nick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) loves them. Mel says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) was trying to make a point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) tells them about an elderly couple who were nearly killed when a drunk teenager hit their camper with his (<font color='blue'><b>teenager</b></font>) car. Both of them survived but were badly injured. Mel describes how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) and other surgeons operated almost all night and that afterward the couple was transferred to a private room. Mel interrupts himself to tell everyone to drink more gin so that they can all go to dinner at a new place he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) and Terri know about. Mel says that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) could come back in another life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'d be a chef or a knight. Terri and Mel debate whether the correct word is vessel or vassal. Nick says that being a knight could be dangerous because of all the heavy armor. Laura asks what happened to the old couple, then struggles to light a cigarette. Nick notes that the sun in the kitchen has changed. Mel tells Laura that if their situations were different, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'d fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). Resuming the story, Mel says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) kept checking in on the old couple, both of whom were in full-body casts. The husband was okay, and the wife was going to be okay, but the husband was depressed because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) couldn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife through the eyeholes in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cast. Mel says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) couldn't believe the man was depressed because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) couldn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) asks everyone whether they see the point. Nick says they're all drunk and that the light is leaving the room. Terri says Mel is depressed and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) to take a pill, but Mel says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'s already taken everything possible. Mel says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) wants to call his (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) kids, but Terri says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>)'ll only feel worse if Marjorie answers the phone. Terri says that Mel wishes Marjorie would remarry or die. Mel says Marjorie is allergic to bees and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) could release bees in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marjorie</b></font>) house to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Marjorie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mel</b></font>) suggests they all go out to eat, but Nick suggests they should just keep drinking. Laura remarks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)'s starving, and Terri says she (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>)'ll serve a snack, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>) stays in her (<font color='blue'><b>Terri</b></font>) seat. Mel notices that the gin is gone, and Terri asks what they should do now. Nick says he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) can hear everyone's heart beating. The four friends just sit in their seats until the room is dark.
