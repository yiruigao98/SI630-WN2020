former student, lives in a tiny garret on the top floor of a run-down apartment
building in St. Petersburg. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) is sickly, dressed in rags, short
on money, and talks to himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) is also handsome, proud,
and intelligent. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) is contemplating committing an awful crime,
but the nature of the crime is not yet clear. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) goes to the apartment
of an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, to get money for
a watch and to plan the crime. Afterward, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) stops for a drink at
a tavern, where he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) meets a man named Marmeladov, who, in a fit of
drunkenness, has abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) job and proceeded on a five-day drinking
binge, afraid to return home to his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) family. Marmeladov tells Raskolnikov
about his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) sickly wife, Katerina Ivanovna, and his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) daughter, Sonya,
who has been forced into prostitution to support the family. Raskolnikov
walks with Marmeladov to Marmeladov's apartment, where he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) meets
Katerina and sees firsthand the squalid conditions in which they
live. The next day, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) mother,
Pulcheria Alexandrovna, informing him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) sister, Dunya, is engaged
to be married to a government official named Luzhin and that they
are all moving to St. Petersburg. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) goes to another tavern, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) overhears a student talking about how society would be better
off if the old pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna were dead. Later, in the
streets, Raskolnikov hears that the pawnbroker will be alone in
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) apartment the next evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) sleeps fitfully and wakes up the
next day, finds an ax, and fashions a fake item to pawn to distract
the pawnbroker. That night, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) goes to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) apartment and kills her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).
While he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) is rummaging through her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bedroom, looking for money, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
sister, Lizaveta, walks in, and Raskolnikov kills her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as well. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>)
barely escapes from the apartment without being seen, then returns
to his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) apartment and collapses on the sofa. Waking up the next day, Raskolnikov frantically searches
his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) clothing for traces of blood. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) receives a summons from the
police, but it seems to be unrelated to the murders. At the police
station, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) learns that his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) landlady is trying to collect money
that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) owes her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). During a conversation about the murders, Raskolnikov
faints, and the police begin to suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>). Raskolnikov returns
to his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) room, collects the goods that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) stole from the pawnbroker,
and buries them under a rock in an out-of-the-way courtyard. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>)
visits his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) friend Razumikhin and refuses his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) offer of work. Returning
to his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) apartment, Raskolnikov falls into a fitful, nightmare-ridden
sleep. After four days of fever and delirium, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) wakes up to find
out that his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) housekeeper, Nastasya, and Razumikhin have been taking
care of him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) learns that Zossimov, a doctor, and Zamyotov, a
young police detective, have also been visiting him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>). They have all
noticed that Raskolnikov becomes extremely uncomfortable whenever
the murders of the pawnbroker and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) sister are mentioned. Luzhin, Dunya's
fiancé, also makes a visit. After a confrontation with Luzhin, Raskolnikov
goes to a café, where he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) almost confesses to Zamyotov that he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) is
the murderer. Afterward, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) impulsively goes to the apartment of
the pawnbroker. On his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) way back home, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) discovers that Marmeladov
has been run over by a carriage. Raskolnikov helps to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>)
back to his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) apartment, where Marmeladov dies. At the apartment,
he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) meets Sonya and gives the family twenty rubles that he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) received
from his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) mother. Returning with Razumikhin to his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) own apartment,
Raskolnikov faints when he (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) discovers that his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) sister and mother
are there waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>). Raskolnikov becomes annoyed with Pulcheria Alexandrovna and
Dunya and orders them out of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) also commands Dunya to
break her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) engagement with Luzhin. Razumikhin, meanwhile, falls in
love with Dunya. The next morning, Razumikhin tries to explain Raskolnikov's
character to Dunya and Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and then the three
return to Raskolnikov's apartment. There, Zossimov greets them and
tells them that Raskolnikov's condition is much improved. Raskolnikov
apologizes for his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) behavior the night before and confesses to giving
all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) money to the Marmeladovs. But he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) soon grows angry
and irritable again and demands that Dunya not marry Luzhin. Dunya
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is meeting with Luzhin that evening, and that
although Luzhin has requested specifically that Raskolnikov not
be there, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would like him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to come nevertheless. Raskolnikov agrees.
At that moment, Sonya enters the room, greatly embarrassed to be
in the presence of Raskolnikov's family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) invites Raskolnikov
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) father's funeral, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) accepts. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) way back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>)
apartment, Sonya is followed by a strange man, who we later learn
is Svidrigailov--Dunya's lecherous former employer who is obsessively
attracted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>). Under the pretense of trying to recover a watch he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pawned, Raskolnikov
visits the magistrate in charge of the murder investigation, Porfiry
Petrovich, a relative of Razumikhin's. Zamyotov is at the detective's
house when Raskolnikov arrives. Raskolnikov and Porfiry have a tense
conversation about the murders. Raskolnikov starts to believe that
Porfiry suspects him (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) and is trying to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) into a trap. Afterward,
Raskolnikov and Razumikhin discuss the conversation, trying to figure
out if Porfiry suspects him (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>). When Raskolnikov returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) apartment,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) learns that a man had come there looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) catches
up to the man in the street, the man calls him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a murderer. That
night Raskolnikov dreams about the pawnbroker's murder. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wakes up, there is a stranger in the room. The stranger is Svidrigailov. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) explains that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would
like Dunya to break her (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) engagement with Luzhin, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) esteems unworthy
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) offers to give Dunya the enormous sum of ten thousand
rubles. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) also tells Raskolnikov that his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) late wife, Marfa Petrovna,
left Dunya three thousand rubles in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will. Raskolnikov rejects
Svidrigailov's offer of money and, after hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) talk about
seeing the ghost of Marfa, suspects that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) is insane. After Svidrigailov
leaves, Raskolnikov and Razumikhin walk to a restaurant to meet
Dunya, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and Luzhin. Razumikhin tells Raskolnikov
that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) is certain that the police suspect Raskolnikov. Luzhin is
insulted to find that Raskolnikov, contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wishes, is in
attendance at the meal. They discuss Svidrigailov's arrival in the
city and the money that has been offered to Dunya. Luzhin and Raskolnikov
get into an argument, during the course of which Luzhin offends
everyone in the room, including his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) fiancée and prospective mother-in-law.
Dunya breaks the engagement and forces him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to leave. Everyone is
overjoyed at his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) departure. Razumikhin starts to talk about plans
to go into the publishing business as a family, but Raskolnikov
ruins the mood by telling them that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) does not want to see them
anymore. When Raskolnikov leaves the room, Razumikhin chases him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
down the stairs. They stop, face-to-face, and Razumikhin realizes,
without a word being spoken, that Raskolnikov is guilty of the murders.
He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) rushes back to Dunya and Pulcheria Alexandrovna to reassure them
that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) will help them through whatever difficulties they encounter. Raskolnikov goes to the apartment of Sonya Marmeladov.
During their conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) learns that Sonya was a friend of
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) victims, Lizaveta. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) forces Sonya to read to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) the
biblical story of Lazarus, who was resurrected by Jesus. Meanwhile,
Svidrigailov eavesdrops from the apartment next door. The following morning, Raskolnikov visits Porfiry Petrovich
at the police department, supposedly in order to turn in a formal request
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) pawned watch. As they converse, Raskolnikov starts to feel
again that Porfiry is trying to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) into a trap. Eventually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>)
breaks under the pressure and accuses Porfiry of playing psychological
games with him (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>). At the height of tension between them, Nikolai,
a workman who is being held under suspicion for the murders, bursts
into the room and confesses to the murders. On the way to Katerina
Ivanovna's memorial dinner for Marmeladov, Raskolnikov meets the
mysterious man who called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a murderer and learns that the man
actually knows very little about the case. The scene shifts to the apartment of Luzhin and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) roommate, Lebezyatnikov,
where Luzhin is nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hatred for Raskolnikov, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blames
for the breaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) engagement to Dunya. Although Luzhin has
been invited to Marmeladov's memorial dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) refuses to go.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) invites Sonya to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room and gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) a ten-ruble bill. Katerina's
memorial dinner goes poorly. The widow is extremely fussy and proud,
but few guests have shown up, and, except for Raskolnikov, those
that have are drunk and crude. Luzhin then enters the room and accuses
Sonya of stealing a one-hundred-ruble bill. Sonya denies his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) claim,
but the bill is discovered in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) pockets. Just as everyone
is about to label Sonya a thief, however, Lebezyatnikov enters and
tells the room that he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) saw Luzhin slip the bill into Sonya's pocket
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) was leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) room. Raskolnikov explains that Luzhin was
probably trying to embarrass him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) by discrediting Sonya. Luzhin leaves,
and a fight breaks out between Katerina and her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) landlady. After the dinner, Raskolnikov goes to Sonya's
room and confesses the murders to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>). They have a long conversation
about his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) confused motives. Sonya tries to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) to confess
to the authorities. Lebezyatnikov then enters and informs them that
Katerina Ivanovna seems to have gone mad--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is parading the children
in the streets, begging for money. Sonya rushes out to find them
while Raskolnikov goes back to his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) room and talks to Dunya. He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) soon
returns to the street and sees Katerina dancing and singing wildly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) collapses after a confrontation with a policeman and, soon after
being brought back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) room, dies. Svidrigailov appears and offers
to pay for the funeral and the care of the children. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) reveals
to Raskolnikov that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) knows Raskolnikov is the murderer. Raskolnikov wanders around in a haze after his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) confession
to Sonya and the death of Katerina. Razumikhin confronts him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) room, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) has gone mad and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) of
the pain that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) has caused his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) mother and sister. After their conversation,
Porfiry Petrovich appears and apologizes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) treatment of Raskolnikov
in the police station. Nonetheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) does not believe Nikolai's
confession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) accuses Raskolnikov of the murders but admits that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) does not have enough evidence to arrest him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>). Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) urges
him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) to confess, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) will receive a lighter sentence
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) does so. Raskolnikov goes looking for Svidrigailov, eventually
finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) in a café. Svidrigailov tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) is still
attracted to Dunya, he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) has gotten engaged to a sixteen-year-old girl.
Svidrigailov parts from Raskolnikov and manages to bring Dunya to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) threatens to rape her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) after she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) refuses to marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fires several shots at him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) with a revolver and misses,
but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) sees how strongly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dislikes him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) allows her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to
leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) takes her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) revolver and wanders aimlessly around St. Petersburg.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) gives three thousand rubles to Dunya, fifteen thousand rubles
to the family of his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) fiancée, and then books a room in a hotel.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) sleeps fitfully and dreams of a flood and a seductive five-year-old
girl. In the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) kills himself. Raskolnikov, who is visiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) mother, tells her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) will always love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and then returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) tells
Dunya that he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) is planning to confess. After she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) leaves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) goes
to visit Sonya, who gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) a cross to wear. On the way to the
police station, he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) stops in a marketplace and kisses the ground.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) almost pulls back from confessing when he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) reaches the police
station and learns of Svidrigailov's suicide. The sight of Sonya,
however, convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) to go through with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovich</b></font>) confesses to
one of the police officials, Ilya Petrovich. A year and a half later, Raskolnikov is in prison
in Siberia, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) has been for nine months. Sonya has moved to
the town outside the prison, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonya</b></font>) visits Raskolnikov regularly
and tries to ease his (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) burden. Because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) confession, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) mental
confusion surrounding the murders, and testimony about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) past
good deeds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) has received, instead of a death sentence, a reduced
sentence of eight years of hard labor in Siberia. After Raskolnikov's
arrest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) mother became delirious and died. Razumikhin and Dunya
were married. For a short while, Raskolnikov remains as proud and
alienated from humanity as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) was before his (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) confession, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>)
eventually realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) truly loves Sonya and expresses remorse
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>) crime.
