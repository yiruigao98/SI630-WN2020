A series of stories ensues, each concerned with a single resident of Winesburg. The first, entitled <div class="bookquote">``Hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>a recluse</b></font>)</div>describes Wing Biddlebaum, a recluse with remarkable hands that he (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) cannot control, who has fled from false accusations of molesting a boy in another town.

Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) son, David Hardy, is sent to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) grandfather on the old man's farm, and Jesse takes the boy out into the forest in search of a message from God. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) finds no message, however, and succeeds only in traumatizing the boy so much that David runs away from Winesburg forever.
