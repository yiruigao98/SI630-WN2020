young man and woman who have recently immigrated to Chicago from Lithuania,
hold their wedding feast at a bar in an area of Chicago known as
Packingtown. The couple and several relatives have come to Chicago
in search of a better life, but Packingtown, the center of Lithuanian
immigration and of Chicago's meatpacking industry, is a hard, dangerous,
and filthy place where it is difficult to find a job. After the
reception, Jurgis and Ona discover that they are more than a hundred
dollars in debt to the saloonkeeper. In Lithuania, custom dictates
that guests at a wedding-feast leave money to cover the cost, but
in America, many of the impoverished immigrants depart from the feast
without leaving any money. Jurgis, who has great faith in the American
Dream, vows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) will simply work harder to make more money. Jurgis, who is young and energetic, quickly finds work,
as do Marija Berczynskas, Ona's cousin, and Jonas, the brother of
Ona's stepmother, Teta Elzbieta. The family signs an agreement to
buy a house, but it turns out to be a swindle; the agreement is
full of hidden costs, and the house is shoddy and poorly maintained.
As the family's living expenses increase, even Ona and young Stanislovas, one
of Teta Elzbieta's children, are forced to look for jobs. Jobs in Packingtown
involve back-breaking labor, however, conducted in unsafe conditions
with little regard for individual workers. Furthermore, the immigrant
community is fraught with crime and corruption. Jurgis's father,
Dede Antanas, finds a job only after agreeing to pay another man
a third of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wages for helping him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) obtain the job. But the job
is too difficult for the old man, and it quickly kills him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Winter is the most dangerous season in Packingtown and
even Jurgis, forced to work in an unheated slaughterhouse in which
it is difficult to see, risks his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life every day by simply going
to work. Marija is courted by Tamoszius, a likable violinist, but
the couple is never able to marry because they never have enough
money to hold a wedding. Marija's factory closes down and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loses
her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) job. Distressed about the terrible conditions of his (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>) family
members' lives, Jurgis joins a union and slowly begins to understand
the web of political corruption and bribery that makes Packingtown
run. Hoping to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>) lot, Jurgis begins trying to learn English.
Marija regains her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) job, but she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is fired when she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) complains about
being cheated out of some of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pay. Ona is now pregnant, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)
job has become increasingly difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) supervisor, Miss Henderson,
oversees a prostitution ring, and most of the other girls at the
factory are made to be prostitutes. Ona gives birth to a healthy boy,
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and Jurgis name Antanas after Jurgis's late father, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) is forced to return to work only seven days later. In Packingtown, any mishap can bring ruin upon a family.
Jurgis sprains his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ankle and is forced to spend nearly three months
in bed, unable to work. Even though poor working conditions caused
the accident, the factory simply cuts off Jurgis's pay while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
recuperates. Unable to tolerate the misery, Jonas abandons the family,
disappearing without a word. Kristoforas, the youngest son of Teta Elzbieta,
dies of food poisoning. Jurgis at last recovers and returns to work,
but the factory refuses to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) job back. After a long,
frustrating search for employment, Jurgis is forced to take a job
at the fertilizer plant, the foulest place in all of Packingtown.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) begins to numb himself with alcohol. Ona is pregnant again. One night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) doesn't return home
from work, and Jurgis discovers that Phil Connor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) boss, kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) after work and forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) to sleep with him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>). Jurgis attacks
Connor and is arrested. After an unfair trial, Jurgis is sentenced
to a month in prison; the family will again be forced to scrape
by without his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) wages. In prison, Jurgis befriends a criminal named
Jack Duane. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) is released, Jurgis discovers that his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) family
has been evicted from its home and is living at the run-down boardinghouse
in which they first stayed when they arrived in Chicago. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>)
enters the boardinghouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) finds Ona screaming; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) is prematurely
in labor, and the effort of giving birth kills her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and the child.
In agony, Jurgis disappears on a drinking binge. At last, Teta Elzbieta convinces Jurgis to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>)
son, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) again begins searching for a job. Through the philanthropy
of a wealthy woman who takes an interest in the family, Jurgis finds
a good job at a steel mill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) dedicates himself to Antanas and
feels renewed hope in life. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) hopes are shattered when Antanas drowns
in the mud-logged street. In despair, Jurgis abandons his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) surviving
family members and wanders the countryside as a tramp. In the winter, Jurgis returns to Chicago, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) finds
a job digging freight tunnels. After injuring himself at work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>)
is forced to spend some time in the hospital. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) is released,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) has no money and cannot find work, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) becomes a beggar. One
night, a wealthy young man named Freddie Jones gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) a one-hundred-dollar
bill, but when Jurgis asks a bartender to change it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), the man
cheats him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ninety-five cents back. Jurgis attacks the man
and is again sent to jail. In prison, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meets Jack Duane again. When
the two men are released, Jurgis becomes Duane's partner, and the
two commit burglaries and muggings. Jurgis is eventually recruited
to work for the corrupt political boss, Mike Scully. When a series
of strikes hits Packingtown, Jurgis crosses the picket lines, undermining
the efforts of the union but making a great deal of money as a scab. One day, Jurgis sees Phil Connor again and attacks him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) is again sent to prison and, because Connor is a crony of Mike
Scully, Jurgis's meager political connections do not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>). After
being released, he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) is forced to live on charity. By this time, Jurgis
has completely lost touch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) family. One day, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>)
meets an old acquaintance who tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) how to find Marija. He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) learns
that Marija has become a prostitute to help support Teta Elzbieta
and the children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) is also addicted to morphine. Jurgis wants
to see Teta Elzbieta again but not until he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) finds a good job. One night, his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) spirit all but crushed by privation and
misery, Jurgis wanders into a socialist political rally, in which
an orator delivers a speech that fills Jurgis with inspiration.
Jurgis joins the socialist party and embraces its ideal that the
workers--not a few wealthy capitalists--should own factories and plants.
Jurgis finds a job as a porter at a socialist-run hotel and is reunited
with Teta Elzbieta. He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) attends a socialist rally in which the speaker
sums up Jurgis's new beliefs: if more people convert to socialism,
the speaker declares, then <div class="bookquote">``Chicago will be ours!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div></body></html>
