The older daughters,
Bessie, Mashah, and Fania, can't find work, and Mashah spends what little money she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>)
has to make herself look more beautiful. Their father, Reb Smolinsky, doesn't work
at all, spending his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) days reading holy books and commandeering his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughters'
wages--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) due as a Jewish father. When Mrs. Smolinsky despairs over the situation,
the youngest daughter, Sara, promptly goes outside to sell herring and
makes the family some money. Later, the older girls find jobs, and Mrs.
Smolinsky rents out the second room, improving the family's financial
situation. Quiet, dutiful Bessie soon falls for a young man named Berel Berenstein and
invites him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home for dinner one night. The rest of the family is excited for Bessie,
but when Reb Smolinsky finds out, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) decides he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't live without the wages Bessie
brings in. Though Berel is willing to marry Bessie without a dowry, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) father says
Berel must also pay for the entire wedding and set him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up in business as well. Berel
refuses and storms out. When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says Bessie should defy her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) crazy father and marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at City Hall, Bessie says she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) doesn't dare. Berel promptly gets engaged to
someone else, crushing Bessie's spirit. Mashah is the next daughter to find a romance that Reb Smolinsky considers
inappropriate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) falls in love with Jacob Novak, a piano player from a rich
family. Mashah's father disapproves of the match and blackmails Jacob into staying
away for several days, breaking Mashah's heart. When Jacob comes back to beg for
forgiveness, Mashah feels defeated enough to stand by and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) father kick Jacob
out for playing piano on the Sabbath. Reb Smolinsky also disapproves of Fania's
sweetheart, a poor poet named Morris Lipkin, and shames him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) then arranges
marriages for all three girls, which leave them all desperately unhappy. Sara is
furious with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father for what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sisters, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) age and gender
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) powerless. Despite Mrs. Smolinsky's warning, Reb Smolinsky takes all of the money he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) got
from Bessie's marriage and sinks it into a grocery store that the previous owner had
filled with fake stock. Sara and Mrs. Smolinsky must again scramble for survival,
and each day they endure increasing criticism from Reb Smolinsky. One day, Sara
reaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breaking point. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) runs away from home and decides to become a teacher.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) plans to live with either Bessie or Mashah, but both have been beaten down by
poverty and bad marriages. Instead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) rents a small, dirty, private room of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>)
own. To pay for it, Sara finds a day job in a laundry, using her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) nights to study and
take classes. The life Sara has chosen is not easy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) faces discrimination for being a
woman and living alone; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fellow workers ostracize her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mother begs her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to
come home more often; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) unhappy sisters nag her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to find a husband of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own.
On top of all this, Sara is desperately lonely, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is visited by an
acquaintance of Fania's, Max Goldstein, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) nearly marries him (<font color='blue'><b>Goldstein</b></font>) and gives up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
dream of seeking knowledge. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) realizes Max is interested only in possessions,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) refuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>). When Reb Smolinsky hears of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>)'s so furious with
Sara that he (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) promptly disowns her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). College is another struggle against poverty and loneliness, but Sara wants so
badly to be like the clean, beautiful people around her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) perseveres and
graduates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gets a job in the New York school system, buys nicer clothing, and
rents a cleaner, larger apartment as a celebration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) new financial
independence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) excitement ends quickly, however, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) learns that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mother,
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hasn't visited in six years, is dying. Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mother's deathbed wish is
that Sara take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father, Reb Smolinsky quickly gets remarried to Mrs.
Feinstein, a widow who lives upstairs. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughters are deeply offended by this
insult to their mother, and after Mrs. Feinstein tries to extort money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Feinstein</b></font>) new
stepchildren, all of them decide to stop speaking to their father. Furious at her (<font color='blue'><b>Feinstein</b></font>) unexpected poverty, Mrs. Feinstein writes a nasty letter to
Hugo Seelig, the principal of Sara's school. The letter, however, actually draws
Hugo and Sara together, and their bond tightens as they talk of their shared
heritage in Poland. This new relationship finally marks the end of Sara's
loneliness, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) new happiness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) decides once again to reach out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
father. Hugo does this as well, and the novel ends with the implication that Reb
Smolinsky will soon escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) new wife by moving in with Hugo and Sara. Sara's life
has come full circle.
