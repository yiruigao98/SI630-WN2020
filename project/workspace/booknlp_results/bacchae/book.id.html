The background to his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) return is presented in the prologue, in which Dionysus tells the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) mother, Semele, once a princess in the royal Theban house of Cadmus. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had an affair with Zeus, the king of the gods, and became pregnant. As revenge, Zeus's jealous wife Hera tricked Semele into asking Zeus to appear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) divine form. Zeus, too powerful for a mortal to behold, emerged from the sky as a bolt of lightning and burnt Semele to a cinder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) managed, however, to rescue his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) unborn son Dionysus and stitched the baby into his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) thigh. Semele's family claimed that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been struck by lightning for lying about Zeus and that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) child, the product of an illicit human affair, had died with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), maligning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) name and rejecting the young god Dionysus. The action of the play begins with Dionysus's return to Thebes years later. He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) arrives in town disguised as the stranger, accompanied by a band of bacchants, to punish the family for their treatment of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) mother and their refusal to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sacrifices. During Dionysus's absence, Semele's father, Cadmus, had handed the kingdom over to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) proud grandson Pentheus. It was Pentheus's decision to not allow the worship of Dionysus in Thebes. Dionysus tells the audience that when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arrived in Thebes he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) drove Semele's sisters mad, and they fled to Mt. Cithaeron to worship him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and perform his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rites on the mountainside. As the ruler of the state and preserver of social order, Pentheus finds himself threatened by the Dionysian rites bringing the women from the city into the forest. Unconvinced of their divinely-caused insanity, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sees their drunken cavorting as an illicit attempt to escape the mores and legal codes regulating Theban society. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) response is therefore a political one, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) orders his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) soldiers to arrest the Lydian stranger and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) maenads, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sees as the root of the troubles. Deviously, Dionysus allows himself to be easily arrested and taken to Pentheus with the others. In the first of three encounters, Dionysus begins the long process of trapping Pentheus and leading him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) death. The encounter begins with the powerful Pentheus thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has caught the delicate stranger. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) orders his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) androgynous prisoner to be chained, bound, and tortured but soon finds it impossible to do so. When Pentheus tries to tie Dionysus he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ties only a bull, when Pentheus plunges a knife into Dionysus the blade passes only through shadow. Suddenly an earthquake shakes the palace, a fire starts, and Pentheus is left weak and puzzled. In their second exchange, Dionysus tries to persuade Pentheus to abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) destructive path, but Pentheus does not relent. A cowherd arrives and describes his (<font color='blue'><b>cowherd</b></font>) sighting of the maddened women of Cadmus. All the women were seen resting blissfully in the forest, feasting on milk, honey and wine that sprang from the ground. They played music, suckled wild animals and sang and danced with joy. But when they saw the cowherd, they flew into a murderous rage and chased after him (<font color='blue'><b>cowherd</b></font>). The cowherd barely escaped, but the herd of cattle was captured and torn apart by hand by the maenads, including Pentheus's mother Agaue. Pentheus is left intrigued and excited by the messenger's marvelous and frightening tale. Dionysus takes note of Pentheus's interest and offers him (<font color='blue'><b>cowherd</b></font>) a chance to see the maenads for himself, undetected. Pentheus, on the verge of launching a military expedition to arrest the band, suddenly cannot resist the opportunity to see the forbidden. He (<font color='blue'><b>cowherd</b></font>) agrees to do all Dionysus suggests, dressing himself in a wig and long skirts. The effeminate Pentheus, stripped of his (<font color='blue'><b>cowherd</b></font>) masculinity and authority, is revealed as a vain, boastful and lecherous creature. Once in the woods, Pentheus cannot see the bacchants from the ground, and wants to mount a tree for a better vantage. Dionysus miraculously bends a tall fir tree, puts Pentheus on top, and gently straightens the tree. At once the maenads see him (<font color='blue'><b>cowherd</b></font>), and Dionysus orders them to attack the vulnerable ruler. With rolling eyes and frenzied cries the women attack, bringing Pentheus down and dragging him (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) to the ground. As he (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) falls Pentheus reaches out for his (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) mother's face and pleads with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son. But Agaue, driven mad by Dionysus, proceeds to rip her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son to death. At the palace the chorus is exultant and sings the praise of Dionysus. Agaue returns home with Pentheus's head in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is still deluded and boasts to all about the young lion she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hunted and beheaded. Old Cadmus, who knows what has happened, sadly approaches his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) daughter and draws her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mind back to the palace, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) family and finally what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is holding in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hands. Agaue begins to weep. Cadmus remarks that the god has punished the family rightly but excessively. In the end, Dionysus finally appears in his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) true form to the city. He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) banishes Agaue from Thebes and ordains that Cadmus and his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) wife will turn into snakes, destined to invade Greek lands with a horde of barbarians.
