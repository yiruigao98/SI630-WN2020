Jürgen Tesman and Hedda Tesman -LRB-nee Hedda Gabler-RRB- are newlyweds. They have just returned from a six-month honeymoon. Hedda is aristocratic and hard to please. Throughout the play, it becomes apparent that Hedda is pregnant. At the beginning of Act 1, Tesman wakes to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Tesman</b></font>) Aunt Julle has arrived for a visit. Aunt Julle raised Tesman and still supports him (<font color='blue'><b>Tesman</b></font>) financially. When Hedda enters, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) is rather rude to Aunt Julle. Tesman asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) to be kinder, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) clearly has little real interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tesman</b></font>) either. Soon, Mrs. Elvsted arrives, bringing news that Tesman's old academic rival, Ejlert Lövborg, is back in town. Lövborg had been an alcoholic and a failure, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tesman</b></font>) has reformed. Eventually, Hedda gets Tesman to leave, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) convinces Mrs. Elvsted to confide in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elvsted</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elvsted</b></font>) learns that Mrs. Elvsted is scared Ejlert will start drinking again and also that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elvsted</b></font>) has come to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tesman</b></font>) without her (<font color='blue'><b>Elvsted</b></font>) husband's permission. Mrs. Elvsted leaves and Judge Brack arrives. Judge Brack brings gossip from town, most notably that Ejlert is quite a success and may be poised to take the position at the university that Tesman is counting on getting himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) leaves, and Tesman tells Hedda that they will have to cut back on their expenses. When Brack returns later that day, in Act 2, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) finds Hedda playing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) pistols, out of boredom. They talk privately for a while and agree that they should form a close, personal bond. Hedda tells Brack how bored she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) honeymoon and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) has no special feeling for the house Tesman has gone to great lengths to buy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>), under the false impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) desperately wanted to live there. Soon, Tesman arrives and talk turns to the stag party that Brack is throwing later that night. Ejlert Lövborg arrives and talks in earnest with Hedda while Tesman and Brack drink in the other room. Then, Mrs. Elvsted arrives. Hedda plays Ejlert and Mrs. Elvsted against each other, making Ejlert think the other was worried he (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) would begin drinking again. At this hint, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) begins to drink and decides to join Tesman and Brack as they leave for the party. Mrs. Elvsted is very upset, but Ejlert promises to return in a few hours to escort her (<font color='blue'><b>Elvsted</b></font>) home. Act 3 begins just before dawn, with Mrs. Elvsted sitting up, still waiting for Ejlert to return. Hedda is asleep on the couch. Soon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) awakes and sends Mrs. Elvsted in to sleep on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elvsted</b></font>) bed. Tesman arrives and tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) has possession of Ejlert's fabulous manuscript, which Ejlert dropped while walking home drunk. Tesman plans to return it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) but is called away, hearing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) Aunt Rina is dying. Brack arrives and tells Hedda that Tesman left before Ejlert got into real trouble, that indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) has been arrested. Brack leaves, and Ejlert arrives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) tells a shocked Mrs. Elvsted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) has destroyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) manuscript. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elvsted</b></font>) is crushed and leaves immediately. Then, Ejlert confesses to Hedda that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) has, in fact, lost the manuscript and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) wants to kill himself. Hedda does not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) has the manuscript; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) simply gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) pistols and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) to have a beautiful death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) leaves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedda</b></font>) burns the manuscript, referring to it as the child of Ejlert and Mrs. Elvsted. Act 4 begins with the living room in darkness. Aunt Julle arrives. Everyone is wearing black as a sign of mourning. We soon learn through dialogue, however, that it is Aunt Rina whose death they mourn: Aunt Julle announces that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julle</b></font>) must find another invalid to take care of now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julle</b></font>) leaves. Mrs. Elvsted arrives, reporting to have heard that Ejlert is in the hospital. Brack arrives and confirms this but reports to the company that Ejlert is, in fact, already dead, having wounded himself in the chest. Tesman and Mrs. Elvsted immediately sit down to try to reconstruct his (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) manuscript in honor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brack</b></font>) death, based on notes Mrs. Elvsted has kept. In private, Brack tells Hedda that it was actually an ugly death, that the pistol went off accidentally, and that scandal might ensue for Hedda. Hedda leaves the room and, after playing the piano for some moments, shoots herself.
