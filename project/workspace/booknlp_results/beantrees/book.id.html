in rural Kentucky. The novel's protagonist, Taylor Greer, who is
known at the beginning of the novel by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bean</b></font>) given name, Marietta,
or by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) nickname, Missy, remembers a moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) childhood when
Newt Hardbine's father was thrown to the top of the Chevron sign
after his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tractor tire exploded. Ever since then, Taylor has been
afraid of tires. Taylor goes on to tell the story of Newt Hardbine,
a peer of Taylor's who died while Taylor was still in high school.
Although Newt and Taylor seemed like identical kids when they were
small, Taylor was the one to escape small-town life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) did so
by avoiding pregnancy, getting a job working at the hospital, and
saving up enough money to buy herself an old Volkswagon bug. About
five years after high school graduation, Taylor says goodbye to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) beloved mother, Alice Greer, and leaves Pittman County, Kentucky,
for good. The protagonist decides that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) will drive until her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>)
car runs out of gas and then take a new name based on wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>)
is when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) car stops. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) ends up in Taylorville, and changes her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>)
name from Marietta to Taylor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) car breaks down in the middle
of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) stops in an old bar
for a cup of coffee and a hamburger. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) sits in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) car, getting
ready to leave, a woman approaches and puts a baby in the front
seat of Taylor's car, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) to take it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) tells Taylor she (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>)
is the sister of the child's mother and that the baby was born in
a Plymouth car. The woman leaves with no further explanation. Taylor
is bewildered, but drives off with the child. They go to a hotel,
and while bathing the baby, Taylor discovers that the baby, a girl,
has been abused and sexually molested. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) names the baby Turtle
because the girl clings to things like a mud turtle. Eventually, Taylor and Turtle make it to Tucson, Arizona.
When Taylor's two back tires blow out, Taylor goes to an auto-repair
shop called Jesus Is Lord Used Tires. There she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) meets the owner,
a kind, wise woman named Mattie. Mattie takes to Turtle right away.
Taylor moves into a Tucson hotel with Turtle and finds a job working
at the Burger Derby. The narrative switches to the story of Lou Ann Ruiz,
another Kentuckian living in Tucson. Lou Ann has been abandoned
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) husband, Angel. On January 1, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>)
gives birth to a son, Dwayne Ray. Lou Ann's mother and Granny Logan
come west to visit the baby, and Granny Logan brings water from
the Tug Fork River in Kentucky, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) suggests should be used
to baptize the baby. When Angel comes home to gather up some of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) pours the water down the drain. Meanwhile, Taylor has started her (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) new job, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) quits
six days later. She (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) begins to look for a place to live, and finds
a room for rent listed in the paper. The room turns out to belong
to Lou Ann. The two women become fast friends, and Taylor takes
the room. Without work, Taylor is left with no option but to take
a job working for Mattie at Jesus Is Lord Used Tires. One day Taylor
meets two of Mattie's friends, Estevan and Esperanza, a married
couple from Guatemala. Soon, it is evident that they are illegal
aliens living with other illegal aliens in Mattie's home above the
tire shop. A month or so later, Taylor takes Turtle to see a doctor
and finds that Turtle's growth has been stunted because she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) was
abused. Turtle is not a baby, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) size indicates, but a three-year-old.
That same day, Angel tells Lou Ann that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) is leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) for good. Mattie's friend Esperanza attempts suicide. When Estevan
comes to tell Taylor this news, he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) ends up divulging the story of
their past. He (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) and Esperanza had to leave behind
a child in Guatemala. The government wanted the names of union members from
Estevan and Esperanza and took their daughter, Ismene, as a way
of forcing them to tell. Choosing to save seventeen lives instead of
trying to get their daughter back, the couple fled their country. Estevan
spends the night on Taylor's couch. Taylor realizes she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is falling
in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>). After a few weeks, Lou Ann gets a job at a salsa factory,
supporting herself in the absence of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband. No sooner does
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) start her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) new job than Angel sends a package with presents for
Lou Ann and Dwayne Ray, and a letter asking her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to come live with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) in Montana, or, if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) does not want to do that, to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>)
come back and live with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in Tucson. After consideration, Lou
Ann refuses to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) back. On the night of the first summer rain, Mattie takes Esperanza, Estevan,
and Taylor into the desert to see the natural world come to life.
Turtle is left with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) baby-sitter, a blind woman named Edna Poppy.
Edna and Turtle go to the park, and because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) disability, Edna
does not notice when a prowler approaches Turtle. Taylor returns
and hears as much of the story as Edna can tell: Edna heard struggling
and swung in the direction of the attacker with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) cane. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) hit
him (<font color='blue'><b>attacker</b></font>) and then felt Turtle tugging on the hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) skirt. Turtle
does not seem hurt, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) has stopped speaking and has the same
vacuous look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>) had when Taylor first saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Edna</b></font>).
Turtle's trauma and the difficulties of Estevan and Esperanza make
Taylor depressed. To make matters worse, the police investigation
into the attack on Turtle reveals that Taylor has no legal claim
on Turtle. Taylor will be forced to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) to a state ward or find
a way around the law. The social worker in Tucson gives Taylor the
name of a legal advisor in Oklahoma, where the laws are different. Mattie becomes worried about Estevan and Esperanza's
safety. A recent crackdown on illegal immigration will force them
to find a new home and a way of getting there. Taylor decides she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>)
will transport Estevan and Esperanza to another sanctuary for illegal
immigrants in Oklahoma. While there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) will look for Turtle's
relatives and see if they will consent to a legal adoption. Once
in Oklahoma, Taylor returns to the bar where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) received Turtle
but finds that it has changed owners. There are no signs of the
people she (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) met there seven months before. Taylor, Esperanza, and
Estevan decide to go to the Lake o' the Cherokees. During that time,
Taylor concocts a plan to convince the authorities in Oklahoma that
Estevan and Esperanza are Turtle's biological parents. Once in the office of Mr. Armistead, the legal authority
in Oklahoma, Esperanza and Estevan pretend to be Turtle's biological
parents. Esperanza sobs real tears at the prospect of giving up
Turtle, and Taylor realizes that Esperanza is grieving the loss
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) own daughter, who looked so much like Turtle. Taylor and
Turtle drop off Esperanza and Estevan at their new home, a church
in Oklahoma. Taylor says a tearful goodbye to Estevan. Taylor then
calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>) mother, who comforts her (<font color='blue'><b>Esperanza</b></font>). Taylor and Turtle head back
to Tucson, a place that both of them now call home.
