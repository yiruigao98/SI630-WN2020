Charlie is the eponymous <div class="bookquote">``wallflower.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is quiet and withdrawn, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is also extremely observant and thoughtful, always paying close attention to everything going on around him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is only a silent witness. Charlie writes the entire book as a series of letters to an anonymous <div class="bookquote">``friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>The reader never learns who this <div class="bookquote">``friend''  (<font color='red'><b>The reader</b></font>)</div>is, and the <div class="bookquote">``friend''  (<font color='red'><b>The reader</b></font>)</div>never writes back. Each letter begins with the greeting <div class="bookquote">``Dear friend''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and ends <div class="bookquote">``Love always, Charlie.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Because the recipient of the letters never writes back, the novel reads like a series of diary entries. When the novel opens, Charlie is grappling with two major traumatic deaths of loved ones in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) past. The most recent death occurred last spring, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) only friend from middle school committed suicide. When Charlie was seven, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) beloved Aunt Helen was killed in a car crash on Christmas Eve, which is also Charlie's birthday. Although Charlie is nervous about entering high school, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) soon finds acceptance from two main sources. First, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) English teacher, Bill Anderson, recognizes Charlie's talent for literature, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) wing, assigning him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) extra books to read and essays to write over the course of the year. Also, Charlie begins to participate more in events, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) becomes friends with Patrick and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) stepsister, Sam, who integrate him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) into their friend group. Charlie develops an enormous crush on Sam, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>stepsister</b></font>) about, but Sam treats him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) affectionately. Patrick, who is gay, is having a closeted relationship with Brad, the quarterback of the football team. Sam kisses Charlie so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) first kiss can be from someone who loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). As the school year progresses, Charlie begins to come out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) shell somewhat, but Charlie's life, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) family life, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) friends' lives become more and more complicated. The holidays are always a difficult time for Charlie's family, because they bring up memories of Aunt Helen's death. This year is no exception. Even though Charlie finds some solace in reading and re-reading The Catcher in the Rye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) still struggles to cope with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) depression and with flashbacks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) time with Aunt Helen. However, Charlie's acceptance by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) friend group helps him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) become more at peace with himself. As Charlie becomes more mature, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) relationship with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sister also deepens. Charlie's sister has an abusive boyfriend. Charlie tells Bill about the boyfriend, and Bill reports it to their parents, which makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sister mad at Charlie. But when Charlie's sister becomes pregnant, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) decides to have an abortion, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) trusts Charlie to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to the clinic. After Charlie performs as Rocky in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) friend group's regular viewings of the film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mary Elizabeth, a smart, pretty senior in their friend group, starts dating Charlie. However, Mary Elizabeth is far more interested in Mary Elizabeth than in having a relationship. During a game of Truth or Dare, Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) kisses Sam. Mary Elizabeth stalks out of the room in a rage. In solidarity, the rest of the group sides with Mary Elizabeth, and Patrick advises Charlie to stay away from everyone for a while until tempers cool down. Brad's abusive father discovers Patrick and Brad's relationship, and Brad is sent to rehab. When Brad returns, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brad</b></font>) refuses to speak to Patrick. Patrick confronts Brad in the cafeteria, Brad makes a derogatory comment about Patrick's homosexuality, and Brad's football teammates beat up Patrick. Charlie jumps in and, in a whirlwind, breaks up the fight. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) defense of Patrick wins back the respect of Sam and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) friend group. Patrick is thoroughly depressed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) leans on Charlie for emotional support. Patrick gets drunk and kisses Charlie, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) apologizes, and Charlie understands that Patrick is lonely and doesn't know how to handle it. Eventually, Patrick sees Brad kissing a strange man in the park, which helps Patrick pull himself together and move on. At the end of the school year, Charlie becomes increasingly anxious as the prospect of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) senior friends moving away becomes more and more imminent. When Sam is packing to leave for her (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) summer pre-college program, she (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) and Charlie begin to make out and start to have sexual contact, but Charlie suddenly gets extremely uncomfortable. The sexual contact dredges up a repressed memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) Aunt Helen molesting him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) as a child. In an epilogue, Charlie writes a final letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>dated two months later, saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) parents had found him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) naked in a catatonic state on the couch. They took him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) to a mental hospital, where Charlie eventually realizes that Aunt Helen had sexually abused him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had repressed these memories. Charlie forgives the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) Aunt Helen, and the novel ends with Charlie writing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is planning to stop writing letters and to start participating fully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) life.
