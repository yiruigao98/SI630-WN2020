King Arthur's court, a strange figure, referred to only as the Green
Knight, pays the court an unexpected visit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) challenges the group's
leader or any other brave representative to a game. The Green Knight
says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) will allow whomever accepts the challenge to strike
him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) own axe, on the condition that the challenger find
him (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) in exactly one year to receive a blow in return. Stunned, Arthur hesitates to respond, but when the Green
Knight mocks Arthur's silence, the king steps forward to take the
challenge. As soon as Arthur grips the Green Knight's axe, Sir Gawain
leaps up and asks to take the challenge himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) takes hold of
the axe and, in one deadly blow, cuts off the knight's head. To
the amazement of the court, the now-headless Green Knight picks
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) severed head. Before riding away, the head reiterates the
terms of the pact, reminding the young Gawain to seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in a year
and a day at the Green Chapel. After the Green Knight leaves, the
company goes back to its festival, but Gawain is uneasy. Time passes, and autumn arrives. On the Day of All Saints, Gawain
prepares to leave Camelot and find the Green Knight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) puts on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) best armor, mounts his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) horse, Gringolet, and starts off toward
North Wales, traveling through the wilderness of northwest Britain.
Gawain encounters all sorts of beasts, suffers from hunger and cold,
and grows more desperate as the days pass. On Christmas Day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>)
prays to find a place to hear Mass, then looks up to see a castle
shimmering in the distance. The lord of the castle welcomes Gawain
warmly, introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lady and to the old woman who sits
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). For sport, the host -LRB-whose name is later revealed to
be Bertilak-RRB- strikes a deal with Gawain: the host will go out hunting
with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) men every day, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) returns in the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) will
exchange his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) winnings for anything Gawain has managed to acquire
by staying behind at the castle. Gawain happily agrees to the pact,
and goes to bed. The first day, the lord hunts a herd of does, while Gawain
sleeps late in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) bedchambers. On the morning of the first day,
the lord's wife sneaks into Gawain's chambers and attempts to seduce
him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Gawain puts her (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) off, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) leaves she (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) steals one kiss
from him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). That evening, when the host gives Gawain the venison he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
has captured, Gawain kisses him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), since he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has won one kiss from
the lady. The second day, the lord hunts a wild boar. The lady again enters
Gawain's chambers, and this time she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kisses Gawain twice. That evening
Gawain gives the host the two kisses in exchange for the boar's
head. The third day, the lord hunts a fox, and the lady kisses
Gawain three times. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) also asks him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) for a love token, such as
a ring or a glove. Gawain refuses to give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) anything and refuses
to take anything from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), until the lady mentions her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) girdle. The
green silk girdle she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wears around her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) waist is no ordinary piece
of cloth, the lady claims, but possesses the magical ability to
protect the person who wears it from death. Intrigued, Gawain accepts
the cloth, but when it comes time to exchange his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) winnings with
the host, Gawain gives the three kisses but does not mention the
lady's green girdle. The host gives Gawain the fox skin he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) won that
day, and they all go to bed happy, but weighed down with the fact
that Gawain must leave for the Green Chapel the following morning
to find the Green Knight. New Year's Day arrives, and Gawain dons his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) armor, including the
girdle, then sets off with Gringolet to seek the Green Knight. A guide
accompanies him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) out of the estate grounds. When they reach the border
of the forest, the guide promises not to tell anyone if Gawain decides
to give up the quest. Gawain refuses, determined to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) fate
head-on. Eventually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) comes to a kind of crevice in a rock, visible
through the tall grasses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) hears the whirring of a grindstone,
confirming his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) suspicion that this strange cavern is in fact the
Green Chapel. Gawain calls out, and the Green Knight emerges to
greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>). Intent on fulfilling the terms of the contract, Gawain
presents his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) neck to the Green Knight, who proceeds to feign two
blows. On the third feint, the Green Knight nicks Gawain's neck,
barely drawing blood. Angered, Gawain shouts that their contract
has been met, but the Green Knight merely laughs. The Green Knight reveals his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) name, Bertilak, and explains
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) is the lord of the castle where Gawain recently stayed.
Because Gawain did not honestly exchange all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) winnings on
the third day, Bertilak drew blood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) third blow. Nevertheless,
Gawain has proven himself a worthy knight, without equal in all
the land. When Gawain questions Bertilak further, Bertilak explains
that the old woman at the castle is really Morgan le Faye, Gawain's
aunt and King Arthur's half sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sent the Green Knight on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) original errand and used her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) magic to change Bertilak's appearance. Relieved
to be alive but extremely guilty about his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) sinful failure to tell
the whole truth, Gawain wears the girdle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) arm as a reminder
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) own failure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) returns to Arthur's court, where all the
knights join Gawain, wearing girdles on their arms to show their support.
