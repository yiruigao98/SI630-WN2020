Because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) cancer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) uses a portable oxygen tank to breathe properly. In one of the meetings she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) catches the eye of a teenage boy, and through the course of the meeting she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) learns the boy's name is Augustus Waters. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s there to support their mutual friend, Isaac. Isaac had a tumor in one eye that he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) had removed, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) has to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) other eye taken out as well. After the meeting ends, Augustus approaches Hazel and tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustus</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustus</b></font>) looks like Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta. He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) invites Hazel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) house to watch the movie, and while hanging out, the two discuss their experiences with cancer. Hazel reveals she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) has thyroid cancer that has spread to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) lungs. Augustus had osteosarcoma, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) is now cancer free after having his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) leg amputated. Before Augustus takes Hazel home, they agree to read one another's favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction. Hazel explains the magnificence of An Imperial Affliction: It is a novel about a girl named Anna who has cancer, and it's the only account she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)'s read of living with cancer that matches her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) experience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) describes how the novel maddeningly ends midsentence, denying the reader closure about the fate of the novel's characters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) speculates about the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten, who fled to Amsterdam after the novel was published and hasn't been heard from since. A week after Hazel and Augustus discuss the literary meaning of An Imperial Affliction, Augustus miraculously reveals he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) tracked down Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and through her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustus</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>)'s managed to start an email correspondence with the reclusive author. He (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) shares Van Houten's letter with Hazel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) devises a list of questions to send Van Houten, hoping to clear up the novel's ambiguous conclusion. Hazel is most concerned with the fate of Anna's mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) figures that if Anna's mother survives her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter's death, then her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own parents will be alright after Hazel dies. Van Houten eventually replies, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) could only answer Hazel's questions in person. He (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) invites her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) to stop by if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) is ever in Amsterdam. Shortly after Augustus invites Hazel on a picnic. It turns out he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>)'s planned an elaborate Dutch-themed picnic where he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) reveals that a charitable foundation that grants the wishes of kids with cancer has agreed to grant his (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>)'s taking the two of them to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) is thrilled, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) touches her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) face she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) feels hesitant for some reason. Over time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) likes him (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) a lot, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>)'ll hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) dies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) compares herself to a grenade. In the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) struggle over what to do about Augustus, Hazel suffers a serious episode in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) lungs fill with fluid and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) goes to the ICU. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) is released after a period of days, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) learns that Augustus never left the hospital's waiting room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) delivers Hazel another letter from Van Houten, this one more personal and more cryptic than the last. After reading the letter, Hazel is more determined than ever to go to Amsterdam. There is a problem though: Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) parents and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) team of doctors don't think Hazel is strong enough to travel. The situation seems hopeless until one of the physicians most familiar with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) case, Dr. Maria, convinces Hazel's parents that Hazel must travel because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) needs to live her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) life. The plans are made for Augustus, Hazel, and Hazel's mother to go to Amsterdam, but when Hazel and Augustus meet Van Houten they find that, instead of a prolific genius, he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) is a mean-spirited drunk who claims he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) cannot answer any of Hazel's questions. The two leave Van Houten's in utter disappointment, and accompanied by Lidewij, who feels horrified by Van Houten's behavior, they tour Anne Frank's house. At the end of the tour, Augustus and Hazel share a romantic kiss, to the applause of spectators. They head back to the hotel where they make love for the first and only time. The following day, Augustus confesses that while Hazel was in the ICU he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) had a body scan which revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) cancer has returned and spread everywhere. They return to Indianapolis, and Hazel realizes Augustus is now the grenade. As his (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) condition worsens he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) is less prone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) typical charm and confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) becomes vulnerable and scared, but is still a beautiful boy in Hazel's mind. As this change occurs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) ceases calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) Augustus and starts referring to him (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) as just Gus, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) parents do. Hazel recognizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) now as much as ever. Augustus's condition deteriorates quickly. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) final days Augustus arranges a prefuneral for himself, and Isaac and Hazel give eulogies. Hazel steals a line from Van Houten about larger and smaller infinities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) says how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) loves Augustus, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustus</b></font>) would not trade their short time together for anything in the world. Augustus dies eight days later. Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten at the funeral. Van Houten explains that he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) and Gus maintained correspondence and that Augustus demanded Van Houten make up for ruining the trip to Amsterdam by coming to his (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) funeral to see Hazel. Van Houten abstractly reveals the fate of Anna's mother, but Hazel is not interested. A few days later Isaac informs Hazel that Augustus was writing something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) had hinted about writing a sequel to An Imperial Affliction for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>), and as Hazel scrambles to locate the pages she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) encounters Van Houten once more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) drunkenly reveals that Anna was the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) died of cancer when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) was eight, and An Imperial Affliction was his (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) literary attempt at reconciling himself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) death. Hazel tells Van Houten to sober up and write another book. Eventually Hazel learns that Augustus sent the pages to Van Houten because he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) wanted Van Houten to use the pages to compose a well-written eulogy about Hazel. Lidewij forces Van Houten to read the pages and sends them straight off to Hazel. The novel concludes with Hazel reading Augustus's words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) says getting hurt in this world is inevitable, but we do get to choose who we allow to hurt us, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) happy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) choice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Houten</b></font>) hopes she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) likes her (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) choice too. The final words of the novel come from Hazel, who says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hazel</b></font>) does.
