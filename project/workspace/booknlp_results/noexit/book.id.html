They had all expected medieval torture devices to punish them for eternity, but instead find a plain room furnished in Second Empire style. None of them will admit the reason for their damnation: Garcin says that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was executed for being a pacifist, while Estelle insists that a mistake has been made. Inez however, demands that they all stop lying to themselves and confess to their crimes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inez</b></font>) refuses to believe that they all ended up in the room by accident and soon realizes that they have been placed together to make each other miserable. Garcin suggests that they try to leave each other alone, but Inez starts to sing about an execution and Estelle wants to find a mirror. Inez tries to seduce Estelle by offering to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Inez</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``mirror''  (<font color='red'><b>Estelle</b></font>)</div>and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Inez</b></font>) everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Inez</b></font>) sees, but ends up frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Inez</b></font>) instead. After arguing they decide to confess to their crimes so they know what to expect from each other. Garcin cheated and mistreated his (<font color='blue'><b>Garcin</b></font>) wife; Inez seduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Inez</b></font>) cousin's wife while living with them; and Estelle cheated on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) husband and drowned her (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) illegitimate baby. Despite their revelations they continue to get on each other's nerves. Garcin finally gives in to Estelle's attempts to seduce him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), driving Inez crazy. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) begs Estelle to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is not a coward for attempting to flee his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) country during wartime. When Inez tells him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that Estelle is just agreeing with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) so she (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) can be with a man, Garcin tries to escape. The door suddenly opens, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is unable to leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will not be saved until Inez has faith in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Inez</b></font>) refuses, promising to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) miserable forever. Forgetting that they are all dead, Estelle unsuccessfully tries to kill Inez, stabbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) repeatedly. Shocked at the absurdity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fate, Garcin concludes, <div class="bookquote">``hell is other people.''
