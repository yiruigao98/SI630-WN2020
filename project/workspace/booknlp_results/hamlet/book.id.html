ghost walks the ramparts of Elsinore Castle in Denmark. Discovered
first by a pair of watchmen, then by the scholar Horatio, the ghost
resembles the recently deceased King Hamlet, whose brother Claudius
has inherited the throne and married the king's widow, Queen Gertrude. When
Horatio and the watchmen bring Prince Hamlet, the son of Gertrude
and the dead king, to see the ghost, it speaks to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), declaring
ominously that it is indeed his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) father's spirit, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was
murdered by none other than Claudius. Ordering Hamlet to seek revenge
on the man who usurped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throne and married his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, the ghost
disappears with the dawn. Prince Hamlet devotes himself to avenging his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) father's
death, but, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is contemplative and thoughtful by nature,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) delays, entering into a deep melancholy and even apparent madness. Claudius
and Gertrude worry about the prince's erratic behavior and attempt
to discover its cause. They employ a pair of Hamlet's friends, Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern, to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>). When Polonius, the pompous Lord
Chamberlain, suggests that Hamlet may be mad with love for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlain</b></font>) daughter,
Ophelia, Claudius agrees to spy on Hamlet in conversation with the
girl. But though Hamlet certainly seems mad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) does not seem to
love Ophelia: he (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) orders her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to enter a nunnery and declares that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) wishes to ban marriages. A group of traveling actors comes to Elsinore, and Hamlet
seizes upon an idea to test his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) uncle's guilt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) will have the
players perform a scene closely resembling the sequence by which
Hamlet imagines his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) uncle to have murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) father, so that if
Claudius is guilty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) will surely react. When the moment of the
murder arrives in the theater, Claudius leaps up and leaves the
room. Hamlet and Horatio agree that this proves his (<font color='blue'><b>Horatio</b></font>) guilt. Hamlet
goes to kill Claudius but finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) praying. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) believes that
killing Claudius while in prayer would send Claudius's soul to heaven,
Hamlet considers that it would be an inadequate revenge and decides
to wait. Claudius, now frightened of Hamlet's madness and fearing
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) own safety, orders that Hamlet be sent to England at once. Hamlet goes to confront his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) mother, in whose bedchamber
Polonius has hidden behind a tapestry. Hearing a noise from behind
the tapestry, Hamlet believes the king is hiding there. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) draws
his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sword and stabs through the fabric, killing Polonius. For
this crime, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is immediately dispatched to England with Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern. However, Claudius's plan for Hamlet includes more
than banishment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) has given Rosencrantz and Guildenstern sealed orders
for the King of England demanding that Hamlet be put to death. In the aftermath of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father's death, Ophelia goes mad
with grief and drowns in the river. Polonius's son, Laertes, who
has been staying in France, returns to Denmark in a rage. Claudius
convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) that Hamlet is to blame for his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) father's and sister's
deaths. When Horatio and the king receive letters from Hamlet indicating that
the prince has returned to Denmark after pirates attacked his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) ship
en route to England, Claudius concocts a plan to use Laertes' desire
for revenge to secure Hamlet's death. Laertes will fence with Hamlet
in innocent sport, but Claudius will poison Laertes' blade so that
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) draws blood, Hamlet will die. As a backup plan, the king decides
to poison a goblet, which he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) will give Hamlet to drink should Hamlet
score the first or second hits of the match. Hamlet returns to the
vicinity of Elsinore just as Ophelia's funeral is taking place.
Stricken with grief, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) attacks Laertes and declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had
in fact always loved Ophelia. Back at the castle, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) tells Horatio that
he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) believes one must be prepared to die, since death can come at any
moment. A foolish courtier named Osric arrives on Claudius's orders
to arrange the fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes. The sword-fighting begins. Hamlet scores the first hit,
but declines to drink from the king's proffered goblet. Instead,
Gertrude takes a drink from it and is swiftly killed by the poison.
Laertes succeeds in wounding Hamlet, though Hamlet does not die
of the poison immediately. First, Laertes is cut by his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own sword's
blade, and, after revealing to Hamlet that Claudius is responsible
for the queen's death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) dies from the blade's poison. Hamlet then
stabs Claudius through with the poisoned sword and forces him (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) to
drink down the rest of the poisoned wine. Claudius dies, and Hamlet
dies immediately after achieving his (<font color='blue'><b>Claudius</b></font>) revenge. At this moment, a Norwegian prince named Fortinbras, who
has led an army to Denmark and attacked Poland earlier in the play, enters
with ambassadors from England, who report that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
are dead. Fortinbras is stunned by the gruesome sight of the entire
royal family lying sprawled on the floor dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) moves to take
power of the kingdom. Horatio, fulfilling Hamlet's last
request, tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Horatio</b></font>) Hamlet's tragic story. Fortinbras orders that
Hamlet be carried away in a manner befitting a fallen soldier.
