She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) points out an article about the Misfit, an escaped convict heading toward Florida, and adds that the children have already been there. John Wesley, eight years old, suggests that the grandmother stay home, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>) sister, June Star, says nastily that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>) grandmother would never do that. On the day of the trip, the grandmother hides her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) cat, Pitty Sing, in a basket in the car. She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) wears a dress and hat with flowers on it so that people will know she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``a lady''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>if there's an accident. In the car, John Wesley says he (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>) doesn't like Georgia, and the grandmother chastises him (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>) for not respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wesley</b></font>) home state. When they pass a cotton field, she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) says there are graves in the middle of it that belonged to the plantation and jokes that the plantation has <div class="bookquote">``Gone with the Wind.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Later, she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) tells a story about an old suitor, Edgar Atkins Teagarden. Edgar brought her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) a watermelon every week, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) carved his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) initials, E. A. T. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) left it on the porch and a black child ate it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) thought it said eat. The family stops at a restaurant called the Tower, owned by Red Sammy Butts. Red Sammy complains that people are untrustworthy, explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) recently let two men buy gasoline on credit. The grandmother tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>)'s a good man for doing it. Red Sam's wife says she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doesn't trust anyone, including Red Sam. The grandmother asks her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>)'s heard about the Misfit, and the woman worries that he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>)'ll rob them. Red Sam says, <div class="bookquote">``A good man is hard to find.''  (<font color='red'><b>Red Sam/Sam</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) and the grandmother lament the state of the world. Back in the car, the grandmother wakes from a nap and realizes that a plantation she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) once visited is nearby. She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) says that the house had six white columns and was at the end of an oak tree--lined driveway. She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) lies that the house had a secret panel to make the house seem more interesting. Excited, the children beg to go to the house until Bailey angrily gives in. The grandmother points him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) to a dirt road. The family drives deep into the woods. The grandmother suddenly remembers that the house was in Tennessee, not in Georgia. Horrified at her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) mistake, she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) jerks her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) feet. Pitty Sing escapes from the basket and startles Bailey, who wrecks the car. The children's mother breaks her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulder, but no one else is hurt. The grandmother decides not to tell Bailey about her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) mistake. A passing car stops, and three men get out, carrying guns. The grandmother thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) recognizes one of them. One of the men, wearing glasses and no shirt, descends into the ditch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) tells the children's mother to make the children sit down because they make him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) nervous. The grandmother suddenly screams because she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>)'s the Misfit. The man says it's not good that she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Bailey curses violently, upsetting the grandmother. The grandmother asks the Misfit whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>)'d shoot a lady, and the Misfit says he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) wouldn't like to. The grandmother claims that she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) can tell he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>)'s a good man and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) comes from <div class="bookquote">``nice people.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The Misfit agrees and praises his (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) parents. The grandmother continues telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>)'s a good man. The Misfit tells the other two men, Hiram and Bobby Lee, to take Bailey and John Wesley into the woods. The grandmother adjusts her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) hat, but the brim breaks off. The Misfit says he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) isn't good but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) isn't the worst man either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) apologizes to the grandmother and the children's mother for not wearing a shirt and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) and the other men had to bury their clothes after they escaped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) says they borrowed the clothes they're wearing from some people they met. The grandmother asks the Misfit whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) ever prays. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) says no, she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) hears two gunshots. The Misfit says he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) used to be a gospel singer, and the grandmother chants, <div class="bookquote">``pray, pray.''  (<font color='red'><b>grandmother</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) wasn't a bad child but that at one point he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) went to prison for a crime he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) can't remember committing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) says a psychiatrist told him (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>)'d killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) father. The grandmother tells the Misfit to pray so that Jesus will help him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>). The Misfit says he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>)'s fine on his (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) own. Bobby Lee and Hiram come back from the woods, and Bobby Lee gives the Misfit the shirt Bailey had been wearing, but the grandmother doesn't realize it's Bailey's. The Misfit tells the children's mother to take the baby and June Star and go with Bobby Lee and Hiram into the woods. Bobby Lee tries to hold June Star's hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) looks like a pig. The grandmother starts chanting, <div class="bookquote">``Jesus, Jesus.''  (<font color='red'><b>The grandmother</b></font>)</div>The Misfit says he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>)'s like Jesus, except Jesus hadn't committed a crime. He (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) gave himself this name because his (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) punishment doesn't seem to fit the crime people said he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) committed. A gunshot comes from the woods. The grandmother begs the Misfit not to shoot a lady. Two more gunshots come from the woods, and the grandmother cries out for Bailey. The Misfit says that Jesus confused everything by raising the dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) says that if what Jesus did is true, then everyone must follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>). But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) didn't actually raise the dead, then all anyone can do is enjoy their time on earth by indulging in <div class="bookquote">``meanness.''  (<font color='red'><b>all anyone</b></font>)</div>The grandmother agrees that perhaps Jesus didn't raise the dead. The Misfit says he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) had been there so he (<font color='blue'><b>Misfit</b></font>) could know for sure. The grandmother calls the Misfit <div class="bookquote">``one of my own children,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Misfit</b></font>)</div>and the Misfit shoots her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) in the chest three times. Bobby Lee and Hiram return, and they all look at the grandmother. The Misfit observes that the grandmother could have been a good woman if someone had been around <div class="bookquote">``to shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) every minute of her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) life.''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>The Misfit says life has no true pleasure.
