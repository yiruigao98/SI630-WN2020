They had traveled all the way from Massachusetts, where the children's mother abandoned them, having become mentally ill. Gram is a terse, eccentric, guarded, and poor woman, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) takes the children in almost in spite of herself, and the book opens with the entire family looking forward warily to the first stage of their life together. Dicey, hardworking and independent, quickly gets a job cleaning the local grocery store and refurbishes an old sailboat in the barn. A few days into the school year, Gram writes the children's names into the family Bible and talks seriously to them about the possibility of adopting them. Gram does not often show emotion other than anger, and the children understand what a powerful statement of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) love for them she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is making when she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) does show those other emotions. Dicey sits stony-faced and uninvolved in school, trying her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hardest not to let anyone know anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), for fear that they will gain some sort of hold over her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). Dicey and all her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) siblings are used to being loners, as growing up in Provincetown, their classmates teased and mocked them because of their mother's untraditional lifestyle. Dicey meets Jeff, an upperclassman who plays guitar, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) regularly stops to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeff</b></font>) and even sing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeff</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) collects her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bicycle, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rebuffs all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeff</b></font>) friendly advances. Similarly, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rejects the friendliness of Mina, a clever and popular girl in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) class, who, despite Dicey's coldness, often engages her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in conversation and even works with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as a partner on a project. As the days pass, Dicey notices the beginnings of problems in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) siblings' lives. Maybeth continues to struggle with reading and fractions, James worries about whether or not his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) classmates will like him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), and Sammy withdraws into himself in school. However, before long, Maybeth's music teacher has noticed the girl's gift for music and offered to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) piano lessons, James gets a paper route to help out, and Sammy agrees to help James. Dicey, used to acting like a mother, begins to feel isolated. Letters from Boston, where Momma is in a mental hospital, arrive regularly, but Gram only tells Dicey that there is no change in Momma's condition, adding to Dicey's sense of isolation. Shortly after parent-teacher conferences, Gram and Dicey go shopping for the family. During their trip, Gram announces the problems her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) siblings are facing: James is dumbing down his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) work to fit in better, Maybeth is failing, and Sammy is wearing a mask to school every day. Gram demands that Dicey help solve these problems, explaining that this is part of holding on to them. Together, they decide to let Sammy know he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) should be himself and to ask James to help Maybeth with her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) reading. Sammy, after talking with Dicey while working together with her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) on the boat, begins to get in fights at school, causing Gram and Dicey a new set of worries. When Dicey receives her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) report card, she (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) finds that she (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) herself has problems to face: she (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) is failing home economics and getting a C in English. She (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) dismisses the home economics grade, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) despises the class, and decides to wait until their English essays are returned to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) teacher about her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) grade. On the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) returns their essays, the teacher, Mr. Chappelle, reads Dicey's paper, which is about Momma, aloud as an exemplar of an excellent paper, but announces that the paper is plagiarized. Mina stands up and defends Dicey, and manages to prove that Dicey wrote the paper. The teacher, shamefaced, returns the paper and promises to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Mina</b></font>) grade. The family has a happy Thanksgiving celebration; they invite Maybeth's music teacher over and eat heartily. The following Saturday, Mina and Jeff, as well as one of James's friends, come over, and they all spend the afternoon singing. The next Monday, Gram, who has deduced that Sammy is fighting because his (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) classmates are teasing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sammy</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mina</b></font>), visits the school and beats all the second graders at their new favorite game, marbles. Many of the children are impressed by Gram's skill and friendliness, and Sammy no longer feels the need to fight. That same day, Jeff asks Dicey to a dance. Dicey, anti-social as always, declines, but feels flattered that Jeff asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mina</b></font>). That night, Gram announces that the legal procedures have been completed and the children are adopted. Shortly after, Gram receives a call from Boston, and without any explanation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mina</b></font>) calls Mr. Lingerle to stay with the younger children while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mina</b></font>) takes Dicey with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mina</b></font>) by plane to Boston. The following morning, Gram leads Dicey into the mental hospital, and when Dicey sees Momma, she (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) is dying. Gram sits with Momma all day, and after sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) for a while, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) hand and talking, Dicey ventures out into the streets with money Gram has given her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) to buy presents for her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) siblings. Dicey buys gifts, uplifted by remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) siblings and finding things they will like. She (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) returns to the hotel, and in the morning Momma is dead. Gram and Dicey, determined to bring Momma home with them, decide to have Momma cremated. They bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Momma</b></font>) home with them on the train in a wooden box Dicey found in a store the day before. In Wilmington, the children and Mr. Lingerle meet them and drive them home. At home, Gram and the children bury Momma under a tree in the front yard. Dicey struggles to let go of the past, of the young girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was before, and of what became of Momma. That night, Gram goes into the attic and, for the first time, brings down family photo albums. Together, the new family looks into their past.
