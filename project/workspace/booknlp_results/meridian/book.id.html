Meridian Hill. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) first sees her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) staring down a manned tank as she (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) escorts local
schoolchildren to a sideshow attraction displaying a mummified woman, on a day the
children, mostly poor and black, are forbidden to attend. After collapsing and being
brought home unconscious, she (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) and Truman catch up. The action then shifts, in a
flashback, to New York City, where, ten years ago, Meridian is unwilling to assert
that she (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) will kill on behalf of a black revolutionary organization, to the dismay of
the others assembled. Then, even further back in time, Meridian, at the age of
thirteen, is unwilling to accept Jesus into her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) life, a decision that prompts her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>)
mother to withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) love. Meridian, back in the present, has decided to return to
her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) roots as a former civil rights worker, and vows to live and work amongst the
people. Truman does not understand the mysterious illness that grips her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>), causing
her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) to experience fainting spells and paralysis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) admits his (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) inability to let her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>)
go. The action shifts to Saxon College, where Meridian and Anne-Marion first meet.
While canvassing a local neighborhood for voters, Meridian meets the Wild Child, a
pregnant, homeless teenager. Meridian captures her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>), then bathes and feeds her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>). When
Meridian makes phone calls to find additional assistance for her (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>), the Wild Child
escapes, runs out into the street, is struck by a car, and dies. Meridian,
Anne-Marion, and other students and neighborhood residents carry the Wild Child's
casket, leading the funeral cortege onto the campus grounds. But the president of
the college denies them access to the chapel for the services. That night
the students riot and chop down the Sojourner, the school's iconic
magnolia tree. In another flashback, Meridian's father deeds sixty acres of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) farmland back
to the Cherokee who once owned it, specifically to Walter Longknife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) camps on the
parcel for a brief period in the summer then cedes ownership back to Meridian's
father. The area, with its serpent-shaped mound, is then made into a historical site
that bars blacks. Meridian and her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father are no longer allowed access to the pit in
the serpent's tail where they experienced the swooning, paralysis, and strange
manifestations that are part of their unique family condition. As a teenager, uninformed about sex, Meridian becomes pregnant, marries, and
drops out of school to have the baby boy, who makes her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feel indifferent at best.
Around the time her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marriage to Eddie is dissolving, Meridian notices the presence
of white civil rights workers in a black neighborhood. Later, the house in which
they are staying is bombed. The incident spurs Meridian to volunteer for the cause.
At the headquarters, she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meets Truman. Soon they are demonstrating together and
getting beaten, arrested, and jailed. Meridian's mother disapproves of Meridian's
radical political activities. Unexpectedly, Meridian is offered a scholarship to
Saxon College. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends attempt to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother that it is a great
opportunity for Meridian. Giving up Eddie Jr., Meridian starts school but is plagued
with the guilt that always dogs her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Meridian tries her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) best to battle loneliness and adjust to college life. After
the Wild Child incident, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) moves off campus, actively continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) civil rights
protests and demonstrations. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) also falls in love with Truman. The two begin
dating, but their newfound bliss as a couple is compromised by the arrival of
college students--white women--from the North who volunteer to assist the movement.
Many invoke a racial patronage or romantically fetishize the foreign, black culture
that they are fully confronting for the first time. Truman is taken by one of the
new arrivals, Lynne, and the two begin dating. Although Truman and Meridian briefly
resume sexual relations, Truman continues to pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) budding relationship with
Lynne. Pregnant, Meridian has an abortion and gets her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) tubes tied. After Lynne
leaves, Truman attempts to rekindle his (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) former love for Meridian, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) to have
his (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) children. Meridian, in response, strikes him (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) bookbag, cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>)
cheek. With graduation approaching, Meridian again falls ill, losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) sight and
lapsing into unconsciousness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) stays in bed for a month. Miss Winters, one of
Saxon's few black instructors, nurses her (<font color='blue'><b>Winters</b></font>) back to health. Anne-Marion, who has also
been at Meridian's side, eventually concludes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Winters</b></font>) is incapable of loving
Meridian and turns her (<font color='blue'><b>Winters</b></font>) back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Winters</b></font>) friend. Truman and Lynne, now married, are living
in Mississippi, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) whiteness begins to endanger them and the movement when a
fellow rights worker, Tommy Odds, has the lower half of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) arms shot off.
Increasingly, Lynne is excluded from the marches and meetings. Despite having a
daughter, Camara, Truman grows more and more distant from his (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) drives to
Alabama to visit Meridian. Newly obsessed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) former lover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) tries to win her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
back, but Meridian spurns his (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) advances. After the death of Camara, Lynne visits
Meridian, whose illness has advanced and claimed most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) hair. Lynne is bitter
over the slow dissolve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) marriage and the way her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) once-idealistic life has
turned out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) has come in search of Truman, whose visits to Meridian have become
more frequent. The action then shifts, in flashback, to Lynne's younger years, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>)
leaves her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) family for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) new life with Truman and the movement. After the shooting,
Tommy Odds rapes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Odds</b></font>) returns with three friends and encourages them to do the
same, but they refuse. Lynne, hysterical, entertains thoughts of leaving and tells
Truman what happened, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) doesn't believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>). Tommy tells Truman that Lynne is
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) solely to atone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) sins, out of guilt for the racism blacks had
suffered for centuries. Lynne and Truman grow increasingly distant, as Lynne
eventually seduces or succumbs to the sexual advances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) friends and other men
in the community. Eventually, the men tire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) and, pregnant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) moves to New
York and lives on welfare. Truman also moves to New York, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) becomes an
artist. When Lynne comes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) apartment uptown to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) that Camara has been
attacked by a man and hospitalized, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) discovers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Camara</b></font>) is living with a young
blond woman. After Camara dies, Truman sends for Meridian, who arrives to comfort
him (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) and Lynne. Lynne recalls her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) impressions of southern Jews and the way they
treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) eventually resolves she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) has no regrets for leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) past, and
its association with white oppressors, behind. The novel's final section opens with the Atlanta funeral cortege of Martin
Luther King, Jr.. Eight years later, Meridian struggles with questions of radicalism
and how the movement ultimately turned out. Truman finds it easier to leave such
issues alone. Meridian remains in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) small town, advocating for the black residents
to vote and try to change their lot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) recalls the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) took to regularly
attend church services. Once, an old man, whose radical son had been killed while
working for the movement, addressed the congregation. Meridian regained her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) wavering
desire to kill on behalf of the rights of blacks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) and Truman continue their
voter-registration drives in earnest. Truman tells Lynne he (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) and will
support her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) as a friend. Truman asks Meridian to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) once did. Meridian
readily asserts that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) does love him (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) but that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) feelings have changed. Cured of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) illness, Meridian prepares to move on, leaving Truman behind to continue the
work that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) started in Chicokema. Reading the poems she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynne</b></font>) has posted on the wall,
Truman falls to the floor in a swoon. Upon awakening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) concludes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Truman</b></font>) must take
up the internal struggle of which Meridian has finally freed herself.
