The man looks out the window, up on a stool. The woman tells him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to close the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gets dizzy from being on their island house. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drags him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over to the chairs and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sits down on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) praises his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intellect, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have had a powerful occupation, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had any ambition. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scoffs at this and complains of boredom. The woman asks the man to tell the story that begins <div class="bookquote">``Then at last we arrived,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has told it to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and performed imitations every night of the seventy- five years they have been married. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) takes a dose of salt each night to erase her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) memory of the story. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tells the story and they repeat phrases from the story until their laughter dies down. The man cannot recall what came after Paris. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admits he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has difficulty expressing himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must <div class="bookquote">``tell it all.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has hired a professional Orator who will speak in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name. Hidden from view, they introduce themselves to the guest and help her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put away her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coat, then re-enter, leaving space for an invisible Lady. They carry on a casual conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and the woman tells the Lady to sit on one of the chairs present, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sits at the other one. The doorbell rings. The man tells the woman to get another chair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opens one door while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hobbles toward a concealed door. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) formally and nervously greets an invisible Colonel. The doorbell rings and the man goes to answer it. The woman leaves to find a chair while the man greets Belle, an elderly friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who was once beautiful, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) husband, a Photo-engraver. The woman gets another chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) introduces the new guests to the others. The light brightens, and it continues to do so as more guests arrive. The woman flirts and makes sexual gestures to the photo-engraver. The man reminisces with Belle about their romantic youth, and how they could have been happy together. The man and woman sit on opposite ends of the chairs and listen to the conversations. The woman discusses their one son who left them when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was seven. The man says they never had a child. The doorbell rings and the man lets in a handful of newspapermen while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife gets more chairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) introduces the other guests to the newspapermen, there to hear the Orator. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) says the Orator will soon speak on his (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) behalf about a system he (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>)'s perfected. There's a loud noise and the main door opens. A powerful light floods in, and the invisible Emperor stands there. The man and woman show their respects, introduce the Emperor to the crowd, and stand up on the stools to get a better look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The Orator, a real person, enters through the main door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) glides along the wall to the center door, bows to the Emperor, and mounts the dais. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) signs invisible autographs. The man introduces himself and thanks the crowd for coming, and thanks the Orator and everyone else involved with the evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) wife can die happily now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) message will be communicated and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) can make his (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) philosophy known to the universe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) wife must die after years of aiding humanity. The man and woman throw themselves out the window. The Orator addresses the crowd, and makes it clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) is deaf and dumb. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) mumbles some unintelligible sounds, then gives up and writes several nonsense words on the blackboard. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) does not get the reaction he (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) was hoping for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orator</b></font>) leaves through the main door.
