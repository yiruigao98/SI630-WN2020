a young American named Winterbourne meets a rich, pretty American
girl named Daisy Miller, who is traveling around Europe with her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) younger brother, Randolph. Winterbourne, who has
lived in Geneva most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) life, is both charmed and mystified
by Daisy, who is less proper than the European girls he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) has encountered.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) seems wonderfully spontaneous, if a little crass and <div class="bookquote">``uncultivated.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Despite the fact that Mrs. Costello, his (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) aunt, strongly disapproves
of the Millers and flatly refuses to be introduced to Daisy, Winterbourne
spends time with Daisy at Vevey and even accompanies her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>), unchaperoned,
to Chillon Castle, a famous local tourist attraction. The following winter, Winterbourne goes to Rome, knowing
Daisy will be there, and is distressed to learn from his (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) aunt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) has taken up with a number of well-known fortune hunters and
become the talk of the town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) has one suitor in particular, a
handsome Italian named Mr. Giovanelli, of uncertain background, whose
conduct with Daisy mystifies Winterbourne and scandalizes the American
community in Rome. Among those scandalized is Mrs. Walker, who is
at the center of Rome's fashionable society. Both Mrs. Walker and Winterbourne attempt to warn Daisy
about the effect her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) behavior is having on her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) reputation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
refuses to listen. As Daisy spends increasingly more time with Mr.
Giovanelli, Winterbourne begins to have doubts about her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) character
and how to interpret her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) behavior. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) also becomes uncertain about
the nature of Daisy's relationship with Mr. Giovanelli. Sometimes
Daisy tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) they are engaged, and other times she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)
they are not. One night, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) way home from a dinner party, Winterbourne
passes the Coliseum and decides to look at it by moonlight, braving
the bad night air that is known to cause <div class="bookquote">``Roman fever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>which is
malaria. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) finds Daisy and Mr. Giovanelli there and immediately
comes to the conclusion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) is too lacking in self-respect to
bother about. Winterbourne is still concerned for Daisy's health,
however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) reproaches Giovanelli and urges him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) safely
home. A few days later, Daisy becomes gravely ill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) dies
soon after. Before dying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mother a message to pass
on to Winterbourne that indicates that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) cared what he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) thought
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) after all. At the time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) does not understand it, but
a year later, still thinking about Daisy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) aunt that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) made a great mistake and has lived in Europe too long. Nevertheless,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) returns to Geneva and his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) former life.
