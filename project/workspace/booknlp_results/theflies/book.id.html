The Tutor complains that the city is unpleasant and that the Argives are unfriendly, but Orestes says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tutor</b></font>) was born there. Jupiter approaches them disguised as a man and tells them the history of Argos: fifteen years ago, Queen Clytemnestra and the present King Aegistheus murdered Agamemnon, the old king and Clytemnestra's husband. The Argives all knew what would happen but did not try to prevent it. Instead of punishing them, the gods sent flies to torment the city. Since the murder, the Argives have been living in remorse, attempting to atone for their sins. Jupiter mentions that Agamemnon had a son named Orestes, and expresses the hope that if Orestes ever came back to Argos he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) would not interfere with the remorse of its people, since this remorse pleases the gods. When Jupiter departs, Orestes complains to his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) Tutor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) feels he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) does not belong anywhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) has no true home and no true family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) could somehow belong to his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) birthplace, Argos. Electra appears and curses the statue of Jupiter in the square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) expresses her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) hope that her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) brother Orestes will one day come to avenge his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father's death and free Argos. Orestes introduces himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) as Philebus. She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) mother has made her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) into a servant and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) hates the king and queen. Orestes tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) that outside Argos people can live happily without remorse. Queen Clytemnestra appears and tells Electra that she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) must come to the annual Dead Man's Day ceremony. Electra explains to Orestes that on this day the dead are let out of a huge cave so they can torture the city for a whole day, avenging the sins that the living have committed. Electra and her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) mother quarrel, but finally Electra agrees to come to the ceremony. She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) asks Orestes to stay long enough to see it. Clytemnestra asks Orestes to leave Argos because his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) presence is upsetting Electra and threatens to bring disaster. Orestes decides to stay for the ceremony. Accompanied by Jupiter, Orestes comes to the ceremony. The Argives publicly announce their sins and scream in fear about how the dead will torture them. Aegistheus tells the guards to find Electra, but they cannot locate her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) begins the ceremony, reminding the Argives of their sins. The cave is opened and the dead are set free. Suddenly Electra appears, dressed in white. The people rebuke her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) for disrespecting the dead, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) begins to dance, telling the Argives that people in other towns live happily with no remorse, and the dead would prefer to see the living be happy, not remorseful. When the Argives begin to listen to Electra, Jupiter causes a large stone to roll away from the cave. Terrified, the people curse Electra for tempting them. Aegistheus orders her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) to leave Argos forever. Once the others have left, Orestes approaches Electra to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) to leave with him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) must stay in Argos because she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) is waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) brother to come and she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) must remain there to help him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) revenge. Orestes reveals his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) identity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>). Electra is shocked because she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to be a warrior. Even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) now knows that Orestes is not a warrior who can help her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) revenge, Electra tells him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) to leave and says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) must stay behind. Orestes asks Zeus for a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) really should leave Argos like a coward. Jupiter causes light to flash around the stone. Suddenly, Orestes realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) must stay and free the people of Argos. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) will not obey the orders of the gods. Realizing at last that this really is her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) brother who she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) thinks has come to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) kill the king and queen, Electra agrees to join him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). Jupiter enters the palace and orders Aegistheus to arrest Orestes and Electra immediately. Aegistheus refuses, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is tired of putting on a false pretense for his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) subjects and would rather die than go on. Jupiter tells him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) that Orestes is dangerous: he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is free, and this could upset the entire order that Aegistheus has been building in Argos. As soon as Jupiter leaves, Orestes and Electra spring out from their hiding place and Orestes kills Aegistheus. Electra loses her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) nerve and tries to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) there, but Orestes brushes her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) off and goes on to kill Clytemnestra. The siblings decide to hide in the shrine of Apollo for the night, but Electra realizes that the flies around them have turned into The Furies, the goddesses of remorse. Orestes and Electra wake up in the shrine the next morning, and Electra is horrified at what has happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) rejects Orestes, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) has brought guilt on her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) through his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) violence. The Furies egg her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) on, and Electra gives herself over to their tortures in order to escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) guilt. Jupiter enters, promising the siblings that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) will give them salvation and the throne of Argos if they repent of their crime. Orestes refuses. Jupiter tells Orestes that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is completely alone and that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) has violated the laws of the gods. Orestes responds that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is free and that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) can follow only his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own laws, even if it means that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) must be alone forever. Jupiter departs, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) pities him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) even though Orestes threatens his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) order. Electra spurns Orestes and runs after Jupiter. Completely alone, Orestes speaks to the Argives who have gathered outside to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) tells them that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is Orestes, their rightful king, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) has come to free them from the flies and their remorse. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) has taken their sins upon himself and they must now learn to create their lives in freedom. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) leaves the city and the Furies follow him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
