Mark, who lives in Omaha, sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) wife, Helen, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) children, Ben Franklin and Peyton, to live with Randy in the isolated Florida town of Fort Repose. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) waits for them to arrive, Randy warns his (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) friends, including his (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) neighbors, the Henrys, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) girlfriend, Lib McGovern. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) begins to stockpile food, and picks up Helen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) children at the airport, as the radio reports that tensions are escalating between the two superpowers. The next morning, war breaks out, and nuclear weapons destroy all of Florida's major cities. Washington is also destroyed, and a low-level Cabinet official becomes President. Having lost all power and communication with the rest of the country, Fort Repose is completely isolated. Disorder prevails in the small town. Randy's best friend, the local doctor Dan Gunn is beaten up by drug addicts, who ransack his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunn</b></font>) clinic; the local police chief is killed; the bank president, Edgar Quisenberry, kills himself. But Randy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) friends, who all eventually come to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) house on River Road, manage to survive and maintain a kind of order in their lives. Randy hooks up a supply of fresh water for his (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) house and his (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) neighbors, and the Henry farm provides food, as does the nearby river. Dan continues to travel around the town seeing patients, doing the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) can with limited medical supplies. A crisis occurs when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) discovers that a number of people are suffering from radiation poisoning, acquired from irradiated jewelry that a man named Porky Logan brought back from near a contaminated city. Dan and Randy handle the crisis together. They collect the jewelry and bury it, along with Porky Logan's body, in a lead-lined coffin. When the townsfolk refuse to help bury the coffin, Randy brandishes a gun and forces them to do so. Randy's authority in the town becomes more and more respected. A radio announcement declares that former Army Reserve officers are to assume responsibility for martial law in isolated areas, and Randy is a former Reserve officer, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) begins to post decrees and take responsibility for law enforcement. When a group of bandits attack and brutally beat Dan Gunn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunn</b></font>) collects a posse and hunts them down -- on the same afternoon that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gunn</b></font>) and Lib are married. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gunn</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunn</b></font>) friend kill three of the bandits and hang the other, although his (<font color='blue'><b>Gunn</b></font>) neighbor, Malachai Henry, is shot and dies. The town struggles through the summer, surviving a brief shortage of fish, and Randy solves a crisis involving a lack of salt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) combs the diary kept by his (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) ancestor, who founded the town, and finds a reference to a nearby pool with a plentiful supply of salt. In autumn, government planes begin flying over the town, and a helicopter lands, carrying Paul Hart, a military man and friend of Randy's from before the war. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) tells them that the country is still trying to restore basic services, and that centuries may pass before the contaminated regions become clean. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randy</b></font>) also confirms that Mark died in the war, meaning that Helen is free to marry Dan, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has fallen in love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) offers to take them out of Fort Repose, but they all prefer to remain in the community they have rebuilt.
