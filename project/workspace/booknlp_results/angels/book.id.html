After the funeral of Louis's grandmother, Prior tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) has contracted AIDS, and Louis panics. He (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) tries to care for Prior but soon realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) cannot stand the strain and fear. Meanwhile, Joe is offered a job in the Justice Department by Roy Cohn, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) right-wing, bigoted mentor and friend. But Harper, who is addicted to Valium and suffers anxiety and hallucinations, does not want to move to Washington. The two couples' fates quickly become intertwined: Joe stumbles upon Louis crying in the bathroom of the courthouse where he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) works, and they strike up an unlikely friendship based in part on Louis's suspicion that Joe is gay. Harper and Prior also meet, in a fantastical mutual dream sequence in which Prior, operating on the <div class="bookquote">``threshold of revelation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harper</b></font>)</div>reveals to Harper that her (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) husband is a closeted homosexual. Harper confronts Joe, who denies it but says he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) has struggled inwardly with the issue. Roy receives a different kind of surprise: At an appointment with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) doctor Henry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) learns that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) too has been diagnosed with AIDS. But Roy, who considers gay men weak and ineffectual, thunders that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) has nothing in common with them--AIDS is a disease of homosexuals, whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) has <div class="bookquote">``liver cancer.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Henry, disgusted, urges him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) clout to obtain an experimental AIDS drug. Prior's illness and Harper's terrors both grow worse. Louis strays from Prior's bedside to seek anonymous sex in Central Park at night. Fortunately, Prior has a more reliable caretaker in Belize, an ex-drag queen and dear friend. Prior confesses to Belize that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has been hearing a wonderful and mysterious voice; Belize is skeptical, but once he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) leaves we hear the voice speak to Prior, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) is a messenger who will soon arrive for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). As the days pass, Louis and Joe grow closer and the sexual tinge in their banter grows more and more obvious. Finally, Joe drunkenly telephones his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mother Hannah in Salt Lake City to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is a homosexual, but Hannah tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is being ridiculous. Nonetheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) makes plans to sell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) house and come to New York to put things right. In a tense and climactic scene, Joe tells Harper about his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) feelings, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) screams at him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to leave, while simultaneously Louis tells Prior he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) is moving out. The disconsolate Prior is awakened one night by the ghosts of two ancestors who tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) they have come to prepare the way for the unseen messenger. Tormented by such supernatural appearances and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) anguish over Louis, Prior becomes increasingly desperate. Joe, equally distraught in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) own way, tells Roy he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) cannot accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) offer; Roy explodes at him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) and calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``sissy.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) then tells Joe about his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) greatest achievement, illegally intervening in the espionage trial of Ethel Rosenberg in the 1950s and guaranteeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethel</b></font>) execution. Joe is shocked by Roy's lack of ethics. When Joe leaves, the ghost of Ethel herself appears, having come to witness Roy's last days on earth. In the climax of Part One, Joe follows Louis to the park, then accompanies him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) home for sex, while Prior's prophetic visions culminate in the appearance of an imposing and beautiful Angel who crashes through the roof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) apartment and proclaims, <div class="bookquote">``The Great Work begins.''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>In Part Two, Harper indulges in the fantasy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethel</b></font>) is in Antarctica with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethel</b></font>) imaginary companion Mr. Lies. But Antarctica turns out to be Brooklyn's Prospect Park, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethel</b></font>) is picked up by the police. With Joe nowhere to be found, Hannah comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) rescue, tending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) in the depths of depression. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) finally insists that Harper join her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) at the Mormon Visitor's Center, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) has begun to volunteer. Meanwhile, the increasingly sick Roy checks in to the hospital where Belize works as a nurse. Roy insults him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) with cutting, racist remarks, but Belize, angry but filled with involuntary respect, gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) valuable advice on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) treatment. Their relationship is always bitter but heated and icy by turns. Belize, however, demonstrates his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) considerable compassion for Prior, who tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) the full story of the Angel's visit. After her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) dramatic arrival, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) gives Prior a prophetic book and explains that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) seeks his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) help to halt the migratory tendency of human beings, which the Angels in Heaven believe tempted God to abandon them. God, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) explains, left Heaven forever on the day of the San Francisco earthquake in 1906, and since then his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) Angels--whose vast powers are fueled by constant sexual activity--have been rudderless and alone. To reverse the trend, the Angel says humans must end their constant motion, their addiction to change. Not surprisingly, Prior is aghast at her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) words and vows to flee from her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) at all costs. Roy learns that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) political opponents plan to disbar him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) for an ethical lapse, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) vows to remain a lawyer until he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) dies. In a friendly rapprochement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) gives Joe his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) blessing, until Joe reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) has left Harper for a man--he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) has been living for a blissful month with Louis. Stunned and angry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) demands that Joe end his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) gay relationship at once. Ethel comes to observe him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) misery. Joe's wife, on the other hand, spends her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) days at the Mormon Visitor's Center watching a diorama of the Mormon migration featuring a father dummy who looks suspiciously like Joe. When Prior drops in to conduct research on angels, a fantasy sequence ensues in which Louis and Joe appear in the diorama. The formerly silent Mormon mother comes to life and leaves with Harper, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) painful but valuable advice on loss and change. Louis and Joe's idyll draws to an end when Louis says he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) wants to see Prior again. At their meeting, Prior coldly insists that he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) must present visible proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) internal bruises. Belize later tells Louis about Joe's relationship with Roy, whose politics and personal history Louis despises. When Louis angrily confronts Joe, their fight turns physical and Joe punches him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) apologizes, horrified, but they never speak again. Roy nears his (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) end as well, reeling from Joe's disclosure and from Ethel's news that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) has been disbarred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) dies, but not before tricking Ethel into tenderly singing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>). After his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) death, Belize summons Louis to recite the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, to demonstrate thanks -LRB-for his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) stash of AIDS drugs-RRB- and forgiveness. Ethel leads Louis in the prayer, the play's emotional and moral climax. After Prior suffers an episode at the visitor's center, Hannah takes him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to the hospital. There, the Angel descends, and Prior wrestles her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) succeeds, and is granted entry into Heaven to refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) prophecy. In Heaven, which resembles San Francisco after the great earthquake, Prior tells the Angels that despite all his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) suffering he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) wants them to bless him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) more life. The Angels sympathize but say they cannot halt the plague. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) tells them should God return, they should sue Him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) for abandonment. Back on earth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) fever broken, Prior tells Louis he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) cannot ever come back. Harper leaves Joe for the last time and sets off on an optimistic voyage to San Francisco to begin her (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) own life. In 1990, four years later, Louis, Prior, Belize and Hannah appear in a moving epilogue. Prior says that the disease has killed many but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) intends to live on, and that the <div class="bookquote">``Great Work''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>will continue.
