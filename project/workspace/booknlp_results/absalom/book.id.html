He (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) buys a hundred square miles of land from an Indian tribe, raises a manor house, plants cotton, and marries the daughter of a local merchant, and within a few years is entrenched among the local aristocracy. Sutpen has a son and a daughter, Henry and Judith, who grow up in a life of uncultivated ease in the northern Mississippi countryside. Henry goes to college at the University of Mississippi in 1859, and meets a sophisticated fellow student named Charles Bon, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) befriends and brings home for Christmas. Charles meets Judith, and over time, an engagement between them is assumed. But Sutpen realizes that Bon is actually his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutpen</b></font>) own son--Henry and Judith's half-brother--from a previous marriage which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutpen</b></font>) abandoned when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutpen</b></font>) discovered that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutpen</b></font>) wife had negro blood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sutpen</b></font>) tells Henry that the engagement cannot be, and that Bon is Henry's own brother; Henry reacts with outrage, refusing to believe that Bon knew all along and willingly became engaged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own sister. Henry repudiates his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) birthright, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and Bon flee to New Orleans. When war breaks out, they enlist, and spend four hard years fighting for the Confederacy as the South crumbles around them. At the end of the war, Sutpen -LRB-a colonel-RRB- finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutpen</b></font>) son and reveals to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sutpen</b></font>) that not only is Bon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutpen</b></font>) and Judith's half-brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutpen</b></font>) is also, in part, a black man. That knowledge makes Henry revolt against Bon in a way that even the idea of incest did not, and on the day Bon arrives to marry Judith, Henry murders him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in front of the gates of the Sutpen plantation. Sutpen returns to a broken house, and becomes a broken--though still forceful--man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slides slowly into alcoholism, begins an affair with a fifteen-year-old white girl named Milly, and continues in that vein until, following the birth of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Milly's daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is murdered by Milly's grandfather Wash Jones in 1869. Decades later, in 1909, Quentin Compson is a twenty-year-old man, the grandson of Sutpen's first friend in the country -LRB-General Compson-RRB-, who is preparing to leave Jefferson to attend Harvard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) is summoned by Miss Rosa Coldfield, the sister of Sutpen's wife Ellen -LRB-and briefly Sutpen's fiancee herself-RRB-, to hear the story of how Sutpen destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) family and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutpen</b></font>) own. Over the following weeks and months, Quentin is drawn deeper and deeper into the Sutpen story, discussing it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quentin</b></font>) father, thinking about it, and later telling it in detail to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quentin</b></font>) Harvard roommate Shreve. The story is burned into his (<font color='blue'><b>Quentin</b></font>) brain the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Quentin</b></font>) goes with Miss Rosa to the Sutpen plantation, where they find Henry Sutpen-- now an old man--waiting to die. Months later, Rosa attempts to return for Henry with an ambulance, but Clytie, Thomas Sutpen's daughter with a slave woman and now a withered old woman herself, sets fire to the manor house, killing herself and Henry, and bringing the Sutpen dynasty to a fiery end.
