No Longer At Ease, begins with a trial against Obi that takes place a while after his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) return, and the novel then works its way backward to explain how Obi has come to be charged with accepting a bribe. The Umuofia Progressive Union -LRB-U.P.U-RRB- has given Obi a scholarship to study law in England, a scholarship that Obi has to pay back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) return. And, thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) leaves for England, stopping in Lagos on the way out. While in England, several things happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>). First, he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) changes his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) course of study to English and abandons law. Secondly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) finds himself nostalgic for home, writing poems about Nigeria. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) meets a girl named Clara at a dance in London but fails to make a good impression. However, the girl is Nigerian also, and on Obi's boat ride back home, after nearly four years in England, he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) meets Clara once again. This time, they begin a relationship. Once back in Nigeria, Obi stays, once again, in Lagos with his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) friend Joseph, trying to find a job and a place of his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) also visits his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) own home village of Umuofia. Obi is quickly given a post on the Scholarship Board of the Civil Service and is also quickly introduced to the world of bribery, which is a world he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) wholeheartedly rejects with a strong idealism at first. This is indicated early on when a man offers Obi money in order for Obi to <div class="bookquote">``pull strings''  (<font color='red'><b>Obi</b></font>)</div>for his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) little sister's scholarship. Obi is appalled and rejects the offer, only later to be met at home by the little sister herself who offers Obi her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) body in return for the scholarship favor. Again, Obi rejects this offer. Although Obi begins his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) life in Nigeria in an honest way, events do not go as he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) has planned. First, Clara tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) cannot marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is an osu, an outcast. Obi decides to ignore this and go against what most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) fellow countrymen believe to be a major transgression of custom, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) decides he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) anyway. Still, his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) economic hardship worsens, given that he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) has to send money home and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) is in debt. Obi then receives a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) father telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) must go home. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) arrives at home he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) sees that his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) mother is very ill. And, his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) parents tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) must not marry Clara because she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is an osu. In fact, Obi's dying mother gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) an ultimatum: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) insists on marrying Clara, he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) must wait until she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is dead because if he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) marries Clara while she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is alive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) will kill herself. Obi, therefore returns back to Lagos and tells Clara all that has transpired. Clara becomes angry and breaks off the engagement, afterwards hinting at the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is pregnant. It is at this point when Obi arranges an abortion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) does not have the money and needs to borrow it. Complications arise out of the operation, and Clara is hospitalized, after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) refuses to see Obi. Obi then returns to work, only to be notified that his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) mother has died. He (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) does not go home for the funeral, and the U.P.U. discusses this failure on Obi's behalf as a sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) not having cared about his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) mother's death. The truth, however, is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) was terribly saddened by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death, feels terrible remorse and guilt, and has entered into a state of mental unrest. However, Obi awakes from this unrest with a new sense of calm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) feels like a new man, and it is at this point that he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) first bribe, not without a certain degree of guilt. Obi allows this acceptance of bribes to become habitual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) continues to take bribes until the end of the novel, when Obi decides he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) cannot stand it anymore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) has paid off all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) debts and can no longer be a part of the corruption. It is at this moment, however, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) has taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) last bribe, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Obi</b></font>) is caught, which brings us back to the beginning of the novel.
