a plantation outside Bayonne, Louisiana, for several years
when a slow-witted man named Jefferson is convicted of murder and
sentenced to death. Jefferson claims he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) is innocent of the crime.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) way to a bar, but changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) mind and decided
to tag along with two men who were on their way to a liquor store. Upon
arriving there, the two men began arguing with the storeowner, and
a shootout ensued. The storeowner and the two men died, and Jefferson
remained at the scene of the crime. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) was arrested and tried for
murder. Jefferson's lawyer argues in court that Jefferson is nothing
but a poor fool, hardly more worthwhile than a hog, and therefore
incapable of plotting such a scheme. The jury quickly brings back
a guilty verdict. Upon hearing the lawyer's speech, Jefferson's godmother,
Miss Emma, resolves to help Jefferson die like a man, not a hog.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asks Grant to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) will resist. Grant left
many years prior to attend college, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) returned an educated
man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) deplores the injustices done to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fellow black men, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) does not want to get involved in Jefferson's case. However, after
considerable pressure from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) aunt, Tante Lou, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) agrees to try
to help Jefferson. Grant, Miss Emma, and Grant's aunt go to visit
Jefferson in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) cell, and they discover that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) too heard the lawyer's
words and has taken them to heart. Silent and moody, Jefferson resists
Grant's feeble attempts to reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>). The three visitors spend an
uncomfortable hour in the cell and then leave. During the next few visits, Jefferson continues to frustrate Grant's
attempts to communicate. When Grant attempts to teach Jefferson
about dignity, Jefferson insists that dignity is for <div class="bookquote">``youmans,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jefferson</b></font>)</div>not hogs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) eats and snuffles in imitation of a hog and tries to
anger Grant with stubbornness and malice, but Grant maintains his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
patience. Each hour-long visit ends in failure, but Grant continues
to try to reach Jefferson. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fourth visit, Grant sparks a conversation
with Jefferson about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) final meal. Jefferson admits that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) wants
a gallon of vanilla ice cream because, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) loves ice cream,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) has never had more than a thimbleful at a time. This admission
begins to break down the barrier between the two men. Grant borrows
money from some townspeople and buys Jefferson a small
radio. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) next visit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) brings Jefferson a notebook and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>)
to write down whatever thoughts come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) mind. Jefferson promises
to do so, and by Grant's next visit, Jefferson has filled most of a
page with thoughts concerning the difference between hogs and men. Grant's relationships with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) girlfriend Vivian
and with Reverend Ambrose begin to intensify. Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) love for
Grant, Vivian dislikes his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tendency to think only of himself, showing
little regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) needs. Grant uses Vivian to escape the troubles
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) continually suggests that they run away from
their hometown and their past in the South. The Reverend Ambrose,
himself unable to reach Jefferson, urges Grant to put aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>)
atheistic beliefs and help save not just Jefferson's character,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) soul. The Reverend declares that Grant must learn to tell
lies for the good of others. Grant focuses his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) energy on Jefferson and tries to explain
the importance of Jefferson's death. Jefferson asks Grant if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>)
believes in heaven and Grant replies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) does not, although
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) qualifies this remark by saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) atheism does not make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) a good man. In fact, Grant says, Jefferson will save even Grant's
atheistic soul if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) carries the cross for the sinners on earth.
Grant explains that the black community in the quarter has spent
centuries enslaved to white men, and that when Jefferson's attorney
called him (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) a hog, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) attacked the will and intelligence of the entire
black society. In consequence, Jefferson now has the opportunity
to stand up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) community. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) has become a symbol to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) people,
and the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) faces his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) death will bear on their self--confidence
and potential. Over the next few weeks, Jefferson continues to write
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) journal. In March, the governor of Louisiana sets the execution
date for two weeks after Easter. As news of Jefferson's impending
death spreads through the town, more and more people begin to visit
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>). Young children and old men, strangers and friends, all come
to -Jefferson's cell to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>). The onslaught of attention
makes Jefferson begin to understand the enormity of the task that
Grant has given him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) has become much more than
an ordinary man and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) death will represent much more than
an ordinary death. Elated by Jefferson's progress, Grant nevertheless dreads
the execution day, when that progress will be tested. Grant cannot bring himself to attend the execution, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) has grown very close to Jefferson. At the time the execution
is scheduled to take place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) orders his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) students to kneel by their
desks in honor of Jefferson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) steps outside the classroom, distressed
and bewildered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) should have attended the execution.
A few minutes later, a deputy comes down from the courthouse and
informs Grant that the execution is over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) assures Grant that
Jefferson was the bravest man in the room that morning. Grant looks
out over the town, numb and heavyhearted, and discovers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
is crying.
