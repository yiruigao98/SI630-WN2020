He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) leaves and Pastor Manders enters. The Pastor tries to convince Regina to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) father, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) pesters him (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>) to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) a position somewhere in high society. She (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) leaves and Mrs. Alving enters. Oswald, Mrs. Alving's son, comes down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) has been traveling in Europe since he (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) was young, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) has not been home in years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) and the Pastor get into an argument over living out of wedlock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>) leaves, and the Pastor admonishes Mrs. Alving for letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) son grow up in such a way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>) also blames her (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) for once leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) husband. Mrs. Alving replies that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) husband made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) miserable and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) son away to save him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) husband's debauchery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) even admits to the Pastor that Regina is the love-child of her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) husband and their former maid, Johanna. As dinner is about to start, the two hear a cry from the kitchen. Apparently Oswald is making advances on Regina. After dinner, the Pastor and Mrs. Alving discuss this strange development. The Pastor realizes that Oswald is furious at Engstrand for never telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>) the truth about Regina. Engstrand enters and suggests to the Pastor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>) hold a prayer meeting at the orphanage. The Pastor questions him (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>), and Engstrand convinces him (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>) that it was only to save Johanna's reputation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>) kept the truth from him (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>). Engstrand and the Pastor leave, and Mrs. Alving goes to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) son. Oswald is drinking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) wants to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) the truth about his (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) about the sickness he (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) is suffering from. A doctor in Paris diagnosed it by saying that the sins of the father visit the son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) goes on to complain about the misery and hypocrisy of gloomy Norway, contrasting it with the joy of life. Mrs. Alving is about to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and Regina the truth, but then they notice that the orphanage has caught fire. Engstrand and the Pastor return to the house, announcing that the orphanage is lost to the flames. Engstrand convinces the Pastor that there will be a public scandal, blaming the Pastor for carelessly letting the prayer candles start the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>) blackmails the Pastor into funding his (<font color='blue'><b>Pastor</b></font>) sailor establishment, convincing the Pastor that it will be dedicated to the reform of sailors. They leave, and Mrs. Alving finally tells Regina and Oswald the truth about their father. Regina feels cheated and goes to claim part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) inheritance. Oswald is partly relieved but reveals to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) mother that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) is sick beyond hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) some morphine pills and asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) to administer them in case of a relapse. As the sun comes up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) melts into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oswald</b></font>) chair and begins to mumble nonsense. Mrs. Alving desperately searches for the pills, having seemingly lost all hope for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alving</b></font>) son or anyone else.
