On the way, home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peck</b></font>) discovers one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peck</b></font>) neighbor's cows, Apron, in the middle of giving birth to a calf. After trying and failing to pull the calf out several times, Robert succeeds by taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pants and tying one leg around the calf's head and the other around its neck. The calf comes out in a heap all over Robert, but its mother is still in trouble. Seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is having trouble breathing, Robert shoves his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand way down the cow's throat and discovers a goiter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) tries to pull the ball out, but Apron bites him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) and drags him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) all over the countryside. When Robert wakes up, Mr. Tanner, the neighbor whose calf he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) just helped, is carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) into the house. Robert's mother, Lucy; father, Haven; and Aunt Carrie tend to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wounds and promise to right whatever trouble Robert had caused. Mrs. Peck sews Robert up, and as they are tucking him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) into bed Robert explains what happens. The next day, Haven comes up to Robert's room and gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) a winter apple, some gum, and a whistle. Though Haven scolds his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) son for skipping school, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) is clearly proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) son's heroism in helping the calves. Robert is bedridden for most of the week and finally comes downstairs for breakfast on Saturday morning. His (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) father puts him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) back to work immediately, and while they are out mending a fence, Benjamin Tanner approaches them. As it turns out, Apron has had two calves, not just one. Benjamin thanks Robert and gives Robert a baby pig for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) trouble. Robert immediately names the pig Pinky, and the two become best friends. Robert soon learns that owning a pig is not easy, as Haven explains that they will have to build Pinky a home away from the other animals. After dinner, they discover an old corn cratch near the barn, which would make a nice house. To make sure that Pinky will not bother the other animals, Robert and Haven set up a capstan, which their ox, Samson, uses to move the cratch to a suitable location. School finally ends, and Robert runs home to Pinky. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) gets there, Mrs. Peck is waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) and ushers him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) inside because Robert's Aunt Matty is over for a visit. Robert greets her (<font color='blue'><b>Peck</b></font>), and then shows his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mother, Aunt Carrie, and then Aunt Matty his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) report card. As the only one among them who can read, Matty is shocked by the 'D' that Robert has gotten in English, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) got `A's in every other subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carrie</b></font>) decides on the spot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carrie</b></font>) is going to tutor Robert and drags him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) into the parlor for a first lesson. Aunt Matty immediately determines the problem and tries to teach Robert how to diagram sentences. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cannot, Matty simply does it all for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Carrie</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to go hang the diagram on his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wall, and Robert does what he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) is told. After chores that day, Robert and Pinky go for a walk on the ridge between their property and the Tanners'. They watch an eagle hunt and kill a rabbit and take in the beauty of the sunset. Later that night while Robert is sleeping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) is awakened by the sound of rain and voices downstairs. Eavesdropping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) learns that Mrs. Hillman has come over in some distress over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hillman</b></font>) husband. Haven then comes in from outside and calls up to Robert to get dressed and yoke up Samson to the wagon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) does this without a word, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) and Haven, armed with shotgun and lantern, head toward Learning. Reaching town, they go to the churchyard and discover Mr. Hillman digging up a grave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hillman</b></font>) is digging up the baby of a love affair that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hillman</b></font>) had once had with one of Mr. Peck's kin so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peck</b></font>) can expose his (<font color='blue'><b>Peck</b></font>) sin to the rest of the world. When Haven sees that Hillman does not plan on desecrating the grave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hillman</b></font>) kin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hillman</b></font>) helps Mr. Hillman finish. With the coffin in tow, they all head back to the Peck place for breakfast. One day, sometime later, while Robert is finishing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) chores, Haven comes home from the slaughterhouse and tells Robert that the Tanners had invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to travel with them to the Rutland Fair. This is big news to Robert, who had been dreaming of taking Pinky to the fair so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pinky</b></font>) might win a blue ribbon. Two days ago, Robert had helped out another neighbor, Mrs. Iris Bascom, move some flower pots, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) some milk and cookies. Over the cookies, Robert had mentioned how he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wanted to go to Rutland, and somehow this had gotten back to the Tanners. The day of the fair finally arrives. Haven drops Robert off at the Tanners' place, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) manners. The Tanners and Robert arrive at Rutland in no time, thanks to the power of Mr. Tanner's twin horses. They head for the stalls where the livestock is kept. The cattle showing is first, so they yoke up Bib and Bob, the calves that Robert assisted in birth, and head for the ring. When their names are called, Robert walks the oxen around the ring three times to the cheers of the crowd. When the show is over, Mrs. Tanner runs up and tells Robert that the children's pig judging will be happening in any minute. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tanner</b></font>) minds the oxen while Robert and Mr. Tanner hurry back to get Pinky. After washing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pinky</b></font>) down, they race over to the judging area, and they get there just in time. Pinky wins a ribbon for being the best-behaved pig at the fair, but Robert doesn't find out until later--when the judge comes over, Robert throws up all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) shoes. When Robert gets home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) talks about Rutland non-stop until his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) parents force him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to go to bed. In the night, Robert hears a commotion in the hen house but is too tired to find out what had happened. In the morning, Mr. Peck reveals that last night a weasel had gotten into the hen house and killed a chicken. Haven then shows him (<font color='blue'><b>Peck</b></font>) the captured weasel, and Robert suggest they ask Ira Long, Mrs. Bascom's hired hand, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wants to test his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dog against it. Ira does, and arrives later that afternoon. When Robert asks, Haven explains that farmers weasel their dogs so that the dogs will know to protect the chickens if one ever tries to get into the hen house. With no more questions, the dog and the weasel are thrown in a barrel, and Robert slams on the lid. Such a fight ensues that Ira has to help Robert hold the barrel upright. When the lid comes off, a terrible cry escapes, and Robert sees that there is not much of the dog left. Understanding its pain, Robert orders Ira to put a bullet in the dog before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) does it himself, and though Ira objects, Haven backs his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) son up and then does the job himself, swearing never to weasel another dog as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lives. When Pinky gets home from the fair, Mr. Peck takes a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pinky</b></font>) and gives Robert some bad news. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was starting to believe that Pinky might be barren because she (<font color='blue'><b>Pinky</b></font>) should have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Pinky</b></font>) first heat by now. This upsets Robert greatly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had hoped that Pinky would become a brood sow and therefore avoid ever being eaten. Later in the evening, Haven gives Robert more bad news. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) has an affliction of some sort and that the coming winter will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) tells Robert that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) is going to have to be the man of the house, which upsets Robert, but Haven just goes up to bed. The next day, while working, Robert runs into Mr. Tanner and explains the situation with Pinky. Later in the afternoon, Mr. Tanner brings his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) prize boar over to court with Pinky and prove whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Pinky</b></font>) is barren or not. After a lot of foreplay, Samson forces himself on Pinky to Robert's horror. Mr. Tanner explains that is the way it always is at first, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) elaborates on the glory of animal husbandry and how Pinky could be the Pecks' road to financial stability. All of this confuses Robert, but it also gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hope. Pinky does turn out to be barren, however, and as winter approaches it becomes obvious that they are going to have to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Pinky</b></font>). Finally, one gray November morning they decide to do it. They head to the tackroom, and Robert gives Pinky one last hug before Haven knocks her (<font color='blue'><b>Pinky</b></font>) out and kills her (<font color='blue'><b>Pinky</b></font>). Robert hates his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) father in that moment, but when they are finished, Robert sees that his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) father's heart is broken, just like his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own. Robert then forgives Haven. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) kisses his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) father's hand and, for the first and last time, sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) father cry. Haven dies in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sleep in May of the next year. Robert finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lying peacefully in the barn and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) that there is no need for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to get up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) finishes the chores and then tells Mrs. Peck and Aunt Carrie what happened and what they have to do. Robert goes into town and makes arrangements with the county coroner for the funeral. The service is short and sweet, and many more people come out than Robert has expected or invited. They bury Haven in the family plot near the apple orchard, and then they go their separate ways. In the time before and after the service, Robert finds random chores to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) busy and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mind off of what had happened. In the tackroom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) finds a piece of paper and pencil, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) father had been trying to learn how to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) name. Near the end of the page, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had almost got the hang of it. Finally it is time to go to bed, and Robert comforts Mrs. Peck and Aunt Carrie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cannot fall asleep himself, however and eventually finds himself walking out toward the apple orchard. When Robert reaches his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) father's grave he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) simply says, <div class="bookquote">``Goodnight, Papa. Thanks for thirteen good years,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) walks back inside.
