He (<font color='blue'><b>Lev</b></font>) has spent the last four years in a Swiss clinic for treatment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lev</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``idiocy''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and epilepsy. Myshkin's only relation in St. Petersburg is the very distant Lizaveta Prokofyevna Yepanchin. Madame Yepanchin is the wife of General Yepanchin, a wealthy and respected man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) late fifties. The prince makes the acquaintance of the Yepanchins, who have three daughters, Alexandra, Adelaida, and Aglaya, the latter being the youngest and the most beautiful. General Yepanchin has an ambitious and rather vain assistant by the name of Gavril Ardalyonovich Ivolgin -LRB-nicknamed Ganya-RRB- whom Myshkin also meets during his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) visit to the household. Ganya, though he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) is actually in love with Aglaya, is in the midst of trying to marry Anastassya Filippovna Barashkov, an extraordinarily beautiful <div class="bookquote">``fatal woman''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>who was once the mistress of the aristocrat Totsky. Totsky has promised Ganya 75,000 rubles if he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) marries the <div class="bookquote">``fallen''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Nastassya Filippovna. As Myshkin is so innocent and naïve, Ganya openly discusses the subject of the proposed marriage in front of the prince. The prince rents a room in the Ivolgin apartment, also occupied by Ganya, his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) sister, Varvara Ardalyonovna -LRB-Varya-RRB-; his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) mother, Nina Alexandrovna; teenage brother, Nikolai -LRB-Kolya-RRB-; his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolai</b></font>) father, General Ivolgin; and another lodger by the name of Ferdyshchenko. Nastassya Filippovna arrives and attempts to insult Ganya's family, which has refused to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) as a possible wife for Ganya. Myshkin, however, stops her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), putting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) behavior to shame. Suddenly a rowdy crowd of drunks and rogues arrives, headed by Parfyon Semyonovich Rogozhin, a dark-haired twenty-seven-year-old who is passionately in love with Nastassya Filippovna. Rogozhin promises to bring 100,000 rubles to Nastassya Filippovna's birthday party scheduled for that evening at which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is to announce whether she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will marry Ganya or not. Among the guests at the party are Totsky, General Yepanchin, Ganya, Ferdyshchenko, Ptitsyn--a usurer friend of Ganya's who is a suitor to Varya Ivolgin--and a few others. With the help of Kolya, Prince Myshkin arrives as well, though uninvited. Following the prince's advice, Nastassya Filippovna refuses Ganya's proposal. Rogozhin arrives with the promised 100,000 rubles, but suddenly Myshkin himself offers to marry Nastassya Filippovna, announcing that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) has recently learned he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) has a large inheritance. Though shocked at such a generous offer by an honest and generous heart, Nastassya Filippovna only deems herself worthy of being with Rogozhin, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Rogozhin</b></font>) leaves the party with Rogozhin and his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) gang. Prince Myshkin spends the next six months following Nastassya Filippovna as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rogozhin</b></font>) runs from Rogozhin to the prince and back. Myshkin's inheritance turns out to be smaller than expected, and it shrinks further as he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) satisfies the claims of creditors and alleged relatives, many of which are fraudulent. Finally, the Prince returns to St. Petersburg and visits Rogozhin's house, which is a dark and dreary place. They discuss religion and exchange crosses. However, later that day, Rogozhin attempts to stab Myshkin in the hall of the prince's hotel, but the prince is saved when he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) has a sudden epileptic fit. Several days later, Myshkin leaves for Pavlovsk, a nearby town popular for summer residence among St. Petersburg nobility. The prince rents several rooms from Lebedev, a rogue functionary. Most of the novel's characters--the Yepanchins, the Ivolgins, Varya and her (<font color='blue'><b>Myshkin</b></font>) husband Ptitsyn, and Nastassya Filippovna--spend the summer in Pavlovsk as well. Burdovsky, a young man who claims himself to be the son of Myshkin's late benefactor, Pavlishchev, comes to the prince and demands money from him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) as a <div class="bookquote">``just''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>reimbursement for Pavlishchev's support of the Prince. Burdovsky is supported by a group of insolent young men who include the consumptive seventeen-year old Hippolite Terentyev, a friend of Kolya Ivolgin. Although Burdovsky's claim is obviously fraudulent--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is not Pavlishchev's son at all--Myshkin is ready and willing to help Burdovsky financially. The prince spends much of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) time at the Yepanchins'. Soon, those around him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) is in love with Aglaya and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Burdovsky</b></font>) most likely returns his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) feelings. However, a haughty, willful, and capricious girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) refuses to admit her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) love for Prince Myshkin, and often even openly mocks him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). Aglaya's family begins to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fiancé, and they even hold a dinner party with many renowned guests who are members of Russian high society. Myshkin, during the course of an agitated and ardent speech on religion and the future of aristocracy, accidentally breaks a beautiful Chinese vase. Later in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) has a mild epileptic fit. The guests and the family are convinced that the seemingly sickly prince is not a good match for Aglaya. Aglaya, however, does not renounce Myshkin, and even arranges a meeting between herself and Nastassya Filippovna, who has been writing letters to Aglaya to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to marry Myshkin. During this meeting, the two women force the Prince to choose between his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) romantic love for Aglaya and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) compassionate pity-love for Nastassya Filippovna. Myshkin hesitates briefly, which prompts Aglaya to run off, breaking all hope of an engagement between them. Nastassya Filippovna wishes to marry the Prince again, but in the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) proves unable to bring herself to do so, instead running off with Rogozhin at the last minute. The Prince follows the two to St. Petersburg the next day and finds that Rogozhin has stabbed Nastassya Filippovna during the night. The two men keep vigil over her (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) body, which Rogozhin has laid out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) study. The epilogue relates that Rogozhin is sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor in Siberia, that Prince Myshkin loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) mind and returns to the Swiss sanitarium, and that Aglaya leaves Russia with a Polish count who lies to her (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) and soon abandons her (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).
