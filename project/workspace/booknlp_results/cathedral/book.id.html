He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) isn't happy about this visitor and the man's blindness unsettles him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) explains that his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife met the blind man ten years ago when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) worked for him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) as a reader to the blind in Seattle. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) says that on the last day of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) job there, the blind man touched her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wrote a poem about the experience. The narrator then describes his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife's past. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) childhood sweetheart and became an officer's wife. Unhappy with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tried to commit suicide one night by swallowing pills, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) survived. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and the blind man kept in touch by sending audiotapes back and forth to each other throughout her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marriage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) told everything to the blind man on tapes. The narrator says that his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife once asked him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) to listen to one of the blind man's tapes. They started to listen but were interrupted before the narrator could hear anything about himself. The narrator suggests taking the blind man bowling. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the blind man's wife, Beulah, just died and says that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll welcome the blind man into their home. The narrator asks whether Beulah was <div class="bookquote">``Negro,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beulah</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) wife asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>)'s drunk. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) then tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) more about Beulah. Beulah became the blind man's reader after the narrator's wife stopped working for him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>), and they eventually got married. After eight years, however, Beulah died from cancer. The narrator thinks how awful it must have been for Beulah to know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Beulah</b></font>) husband could never look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beulah</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) speculates that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beulah</b></font>) could have worn whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Beulah</b></font>) wanted. The narrator's wife goes to pick up the blind man at the train station as the narrator waits at the house. When they arrive, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) watches his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife laughing and talking with the blind man as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) leads him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the arm to the house. The narrator is shocked to see that the blind man has a full beard. The wife introduces the narrator to the blind man, whose name is Robert. They all sit in the living room. The narrator asks what side of the train he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) sat on, and Robert says he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sat on the right and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hadn't been on a train for years. The narrator says his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) but doesn't seem to like what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sees. The narrator says he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)'s never known a blind person. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) describes what Robert looks like and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)'s wearing. Robert doesn't wear dark glasses, which the narrator finds strange. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wishes Robert would wear them because his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) eyes look weird and turn in strange directions. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) pours scotch for all three of them, and they talk about Robert's trip. Robert smokes several cigarettes. The narrator says he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) didn't think blind people could smoke. They sit down for dinner and eat ravenously, not speaking, eating so much that they are dazed. After dinner, they go back to the living room to drink more. The wife and Robert talk about things that have happened to them in the past ten years, while the narrator occasionally tries to join in. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) learns that Robert and Beulah had run an Amway distributorship and that Robert is a ham radio operator. When Robert asks the narrator questions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) makes only short responses. The narrator then turns on the television, irritating his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife. The wife goes upstairs to change clothes and is gone a long time. The narrator offers Robert some pot, and they smoke a joint. The wife joins them when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) comes back. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s going to just sit with them on the couch with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes closed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) immediately falls asleep. The narrator changes the channel and asks Robert if he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wants to go to bed. Robert says he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)'ll stay up with the narrator so that they can talk some more. The narrator says he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) likes the company and that he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife never go to bed at the same time. There is a program about the Middle Ages on television. Nothing else is on, but Robert says he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) likes learning things. When the TV narrator doesn't describe what's happening, the narrator tries to explain to Robert what's going on. The TV narrator begins talking about cathedrals, showing different ones in different countries. The narrator asks Robert whether he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) has any idea what a cathedral looks like. Robert says he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) doesn't and asks the narrator to describe one. The narrator tries, but he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) doesn't do a very good job. Robert asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)'s religious, and the narrator says he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) doesn't believe in anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) can't describe a cathedral because cathedrals are meaningless for him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>). Robert asks the narrator to find a piece of paper and pen. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) and the narrator sit around the coffee table, and Robert tells the narrator to draw a cathedral. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand over the narrator's hand, following the movement of the pen. The narrator draws and draws, getting wrapped up in what he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)'s doing. His (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) wife wakes up and asks what's going on, and Robert answers that they're drawing a cathedral. The wife doesn't understand. Robert tells the narrator to close his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) eyes and keep drawing, and the narrator does so. Soon Robert tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) eyes and see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)'s drawn, but the narrator doesn't open them. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)'s in his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) own home, but he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>)'s nowhere. With his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) eyes still closed, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) says the drawing is <div class="bookquote">``really something.''
