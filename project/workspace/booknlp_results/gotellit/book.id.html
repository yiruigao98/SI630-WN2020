<html><head><style> .bookquote {background-color:#FFDDFF; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px; overflow:auto; display:inline; border-bottom: dotted; border-width: thin; }</style></head><body><h1>Characters</h1>8	John (8) <br />3	Gabriel (3) <br />2	Baldwin (2) <br /><h1>Text</h1><p/>In Go Tell It on the Mountain, author James Baldwin describes the course of the fourteenth birthday of John Grimes in Harlem, 1935. Baldwin also uses extended flashback episodes to recount the lives of John's parents and aunt and to link this urban boy in the North to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) slave grandmother in an earlier South. The first section follows John's thoughts, the second mostly his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) aunt's, the third his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father's, the fourth his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother's, and the fifth again mostly John's. The title Go Tell It on the Mountain comes from a Negro spiritual. The novel is steeped in the language of the King James Bible, and the Bible is a constant presence in the characters' lives; thus, a familiarity with Biblical stories can enhance the reader's understanding of the text. At the heart of the story three main conflicts intertwine: a clash between father and son, a coming-of-age struggle, and a religious crisis. Baldwin deals with issues of race and racism more elliptically in this novel than in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baldwin</b></font>) other works, but these issues inform all three of the text's central problems--indeed, according to some critics, these issues take center stage in the book, though subtly. John doesn't understand why his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father hates him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), reserving his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) love for John's younger brother Roy instead. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is torn between his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) desire to win his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father's love and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hatred for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father -LRB-and the strict religious world this man represents-RRB-. The boy believes himself to have committed the first major sin of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life--a belief that helps precipitate a religious crisis. Before the night is over John will undergo a religious transformation, experiencing salvation on the <div class="bookquote">``threshing-floor''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) family's storefront Harlem church. Yet this will not earn him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father's love. What John does not know, but the reader does, is that the man he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thinks is his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father--Gabriel--is, in fact, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stepfather; unbeknownst to John, Gabriel's resentment of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has nothing to do with himself and everything to do with Gabriel's own concealed past.
