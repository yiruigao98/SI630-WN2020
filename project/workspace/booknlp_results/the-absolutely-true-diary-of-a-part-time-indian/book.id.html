How doctors predicted he (<font color='blue'><b>Jr.</b></font>) would die from complications of hydrocephalus--his (<font color='blue'><b>Jr.</b></font>) being born with excess spinal fluid on the brain. But, of course, Junior survived. The early condition, however, left Junior with a lisp and stutter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) had too many teeth and had to have some removed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) is far-sighted in one eye and near-sighted in the other. Worst of all, as a small child he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) had seizures. Even today, other Indians on the reservation or, as Junior calls it, the <div class="bookquote">``rez,''  (<font color='red'><b>Junior</b></font>)</div>bully him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) and call him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) names like <div class="bookquote">``hydrohead.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Junior's best friend, Rowdy, often promises to protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Rowdy</b></font>), but Rowdy's own violent tendencies sometimes prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Rowdy</b></font>) from being all that helpful. Junior's parents are alcoholics and his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) sister, Mary, spends all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) time in the family basement. Junior loves drawing cartoons, and many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) drawings are included in the book. Rowdy is extremely supportive of Junior's art, and Junior thinks this proves his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) and Rowdy's friendship. In the summer before their freshman year of high school, Rowdy convinces Junior to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) to the Spokane powwow. Junior is fourteen. Rowdy promises to protect Junior from any bullies, but, soon after they arrive, Rowdy trips into a van, embarrassing himself. Rowdy takes out his (<font color='blue'><b>Rowdy</b></font>) anger by attacking the van with a shovel, but the vandalism scares Junior. Junior runs away into a set of mean, drunk, thirty-year-old triplets. They push him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) around and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) up. Later, to make up for having let Junior down, Rowdy sneaks into the triplets' camp at night and cuts off their long braids, emasculating them. Junior sees it as more proof that Rowdy does the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) can. Soon thereafter, Junior and Rowdy begin their first year at Wellpinit High. Junior is excited to get started and is especially looking forward to his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) geometry class. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) geometry teacher, Mr. P, gives Junior a textbook that Junior sees was signed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) mother, Agnes Adams, thirty years previously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) throws the textbook in a fit of rage. It hits Mr. P in the face, breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) nose. After the textbook incident, Junior is suspended from school. Much to Junior's surprise, Mr. P comes to Junior's house to apologize to Junior. Mr. P tells Junior that there is no hope on the reservation, and that the best thing Junior can do for himself is to get off the reservation as quickly as possible. Mr. P says that Junior is smart, but that Mary was even smarter and more talented than Junior until the reservation crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spirit. Junior takes Mr. P advice, and, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) parents come home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) tells them he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>)'s decided to go to school in the all-white town of Reardan, some twenty-two miles from home. Junior's parents agree, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) starts school the next day. Because his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) family is very poor, sometimes without any money for gas, Junior often has difficulty getting to Reardan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) hitchhikes or gets rides from people like his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) dad's friend, Eugene. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) first day, Junior meets his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) future girlfriend, Penelope. A few days later, the toughest jock, Roger, insults Junior with a racist joke, and Junior punches him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) in the face. Junior is surprised to find that his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) action earns him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) Roger's respect. Then, Junior's future friend, Gordy, sticks up for Junior in class. On the reservation, however, Rowdy and the other Indians feel betrayed. Most react by ignoring Junior, but some are angrier than that. To impress Penelope, Junior decides to raise money for the homeless while trick-or-treating. But, after Junior starts going door-to-door, word gets around that he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) is carrying money. Junior gets jumped by three boys in masks. Junior fears that Rowdy is one of them. Penelope finds out and donates money in both her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) and Junior's names. Then, around Thanksgiving, Mary gets married to a Montana poker player she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) meets at the Spokane casino, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) moves with him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) to Montana without saying goodbye to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) family. Junior wonders if Mary is competing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) managed to get off the reservation. Junior hears from Mary occasionally thereafter by email and letter. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) messages, Mary says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is struggling to find a job, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remains optimistic. Later that fall, Junior tries out for the Reardan basketball team and has to play one-on-one against Roger, who is 6'6'' and can dunk. It's a tough match up, but Junior holds his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) own and is rewarded with a spot on the varsity team. Junior's team plays an early game against Wellpinit on the reservation where the entire crowd turns its back on Junior when his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) team enters the gym. While Junior is checking into the game for the first time, a fan throws a quarter at him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>), hitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) in the head. Junior asks Eugene, an EMT, to stich him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) up in the locker room, but, just after he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) checks back into the game, Rowdy fouls Junior so badly he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) gives Junior a concussion. Reardan loses badly, but, weeks later, in the teams' next match up at Reardan, Junior's strong defense leads Reardan to decisive victory. Wellpinit's season is ruined, and Reardan loses, later, early in the state playoffs. Then the tragedies begin. Junior's grandmother, whom Junior admires for her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) tolerance and generosity, is struck and killed by a drunk driver as she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) is walking home from a powwow. A white billionaire named Ted makes a pompous speech at her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) well-attended funeral, and the Indians laugh him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) off the reservation. Then, Eugene's friend, Bobby, shoots Eugene in the face over the last sip of a bottle of wine. Later, just when Junior thinks things can't get any worse, the school guidance counselor calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) into the hall to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) that Mary has died. Junior's dad picks him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) up from school and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) that Mary and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband's trailer caught on fire while the two were passed out from excess drinking. Rowdy blames Junior for Mary's death, but Junior somehow manages to finish the school year and get a decent report card. He (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) family begin to heal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) promises his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) Mom that he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) will never drink. That summer, Rowdy comes to Junior's house to see if Junior will hang out. The book ends with the two playing a game of one-on-one in the summer heat.
