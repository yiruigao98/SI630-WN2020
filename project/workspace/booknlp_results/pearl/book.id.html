son, Coyotito, live in a modest brush house by the sea.
One morning, calamity strikes when a scorpion stings Coyotito. Hoping
to protect their son, Kino and Juana rush him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to the doctor in town.
When they arrive at the doctor's gate, they are turned away because
they are poor natives who cannot pay enough. Later that same morning, Kino and Juana take their family canoe,
an heirloom, out to the estuary to go diving for pearls. Juana makes
a poultice for Coyotito's wound, while Kino searches the sea bottom.
Juana's prayers for a large pearl are answered when Kino surfaces
with the largest pearl either of them has ever seen. Kino lets out
a triumphant yell at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) good fortune, prompting the surrounding
boats to circle in and examine the treasure. In the afternoon, the whole neighborhood gathers
at Kino's brush house to celebrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) find. Kino names a list of
things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) will secure for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) family with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) newfound wealth,
including a church wedding and an education for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) son. The neighbors
marvel at Kino's boldness and wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) is foolish or wise to
harbor such ambitions. Toward evening, the local priest visits Kino to bless
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) good fortune and to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) place within the
church. Shortly thereafter, the doctor arrives, explaining that
he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was out in the morning but has come now to cure Coyotito. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
administers a powdered capsule and promises to return in an hour. In the intervening period, Coyotito grows violently
ill, and Kino decides to bury the pearl under the floor in a corner
of the brush house. The doctor returns and feeds Coyotito a potion
to quiet his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) spasms. When the doctor inquires about payment, Kino
explains that soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) will sell his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) large pearl and inadvertently
glances toward the corner where he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) has hidden the pearl. This mention
of the pearl greatly intrigues the doctor, and Kino is left with
an uneasy feeling. Before going to bed, Kino reburies the pearl under his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>)
sleeping mat. That night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) is roused by an intruder
digging around in the corner. A violent struggle ensues, and Kino's
efforts to chase away the criminal leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) bloodied. Terribly
upset by this turn of events, Juana proposes that they abandon the
pearl, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>) considers an agent of evil. The next morning, Kino and Juana make their way to town
to sell the pearl. Juan Tomás, Kino's brother, advises Kino to be
wary of cheats. Indeed, all of the dealers conspire to bid low on
the pearl. Kino indignantly refuses to accept their offers, resolving
instead to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) pearl to the capital. That evening, as Kino
and Juana prepare to leave, Juan Tomás cautions Kino against being
overly proud, and Juana repeats her (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>) wish to be rid of the pearl.
Kino silences her (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>), explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) is a man and will take care
of things. In the middle of the night, Juana steals away
with the pearl. Kino wakes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>) leaves and pursues her (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>), apprehending
her (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>) just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>) is poised to throw the pearl into the sea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) tackles
her (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>), takes the pearl back, and beats her (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>) violently, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>)
in a crumpled heap on the beach. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) returns to the brush house,
a group of hostile men confronts him (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) and tries to take the pearl from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) fights the men off, killing one and causing the rest to
flee, but drops the pearl in the process. As Juana ascends from the shore to the brush house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>)
finds the pearl lying in the path. Just beyond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>) sees Kino on
the ground, next to the dead man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) bemoans the loss of the pearl,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>) presents to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>). Though Kino explains that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) had no intention
to kill, Juana insists that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) will be labeled a murderer. They
resolve to flee at once. Kino rushes back to the shore to prepare
the canoe, while Juana returns home to gather Coyotito and their
belongings. Kino arrives at the shore and finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) canoe destroyed
by vandals. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) climbs the hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) sees a fire blazing, and
realizes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) house has burned down. Desperate to find refuge,
Kino, Juana and Coyotito duck into Juan Tomás's house, where they
hide out for the day. Relieved that the three did not perish in
the blaze, as the rest of the neighborhood believes, Juan Tomás
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tomás</b></font>) wife, Apolonia, reluctantly agree to keep Kino and Juana's
secret and provide shelter for them while pretending to be ignorant
of their whereabouts. At nightfall, Kino, Juana, and Coyotito set out for the
capital. Skirting the town, they travel north until sunrise
and then take covert shelter by the roadside. They sleep for most
of the day and are preparing to set out again when Kino discovers
that three trackers are following them. After hesitating briefly,
Kino decides that they must hurry up the mountain, in hopes of eluding
the trackers. A breathless ascent brings them to a water source, where
they rest and take shelter in a nearby cave. Kino attempts to mislead
the trackers by creating a false trail up the mountain. Kino, Juana,
and Coyotito then hide in the cave and wait for an opportunity to
escape back down the mountain. The trackers are slow in their pursuit and finally arrive
at the watering hole at dusk. They make camp nearby, and two of
the trackers sleep while the third stands watch. Kino decides that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) must attempt to attack them before the late moon rises.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) strips naked to avoid being seen and sneaks up to striking distance.
Just as Kino prepares to attack, Coyotito lets out a cry, waking
the sleepers. When one of them fires his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) rifle in the direction
of the cry, Kino makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) move, killing the trackers in a violent
fury. In the aftermath, Kino slowly realizes that the rifle shot
struck and killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) son in the cave. The next day, Kino and Juana make their way back through town
and the outlying brush houses. Juana carries her (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>) dead son slung
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Juana</b></font>) shoulder. They walk all the way to the sea, as onlookers
watch in silent fascination. At the shore, Kino pulls the pearl
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) clothing and takes one last, hard look at it. Then, with
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) might, under a setting sun, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kino</b></font>) flings the pearl back into
the sea.
