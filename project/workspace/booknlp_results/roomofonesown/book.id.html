that Woolf has been invited to lecture on the topic of Women and
Fiction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woolf</b></font>) advances the thesis that <div class="bookquote">``a woman must have money and
a room of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is to write fiction.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) essay is constructed
as a partly-fictionalized narrative of the thinking that led her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
to adopt this thesis. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dramatizes that mental process in the
character of an imaginary narrator -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton,
Mary Carmichael or by any name you please--it is not a matter of
any importance'' (<font color='red'><b>an narrator</b></font>)</div>-RRB- who is in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) same position, wrestling with the
same topic. The narrator begins her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) investigation at Oxbridge College, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reflects on the different educational experiences available to
men and women as well as on more material differences in their lives.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) then spends a day in the British Library perusing the scholarship
on women, all of which has written by men and all of which has been
written in anger. Turning to history, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) finds so little data about
the everyday lives of women that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) decides to reconstruct their
existence imaginatively. The figure of Judith Shakespeare is generated
as an example of the tragic fate a highly intelligent woman would
have met with under those circumstances. In light of this background,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) considers the achievements of the major women novelists of the
nineteenth century and reflects on the importance of tradition to
an aspiring writer. A survey of the current state of literature
follows, conducted through a reading the first novel of one of the
narrator's contemporaries. Woolf closes the essay with an exhortation
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) audience of women to take up the tradition that has been
so hardly bequeathed to them, and to increase the endowment for
their own daughters.
