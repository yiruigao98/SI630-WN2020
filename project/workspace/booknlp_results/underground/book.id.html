from Underground is a bitter, misanthropic man living alone
in St. Petersburg, Russia, in the 1860s.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a veteran of the Russian civil service who has recently been
able to retire because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has inherited some money. The novel consists
of the <div class="bookquote">``notes''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>that the man writes, a confused and often contradictory
set of memoirs or confessions describing and explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alienation from
modern society. Notes from Underground is divided into
two sections. The first, <div class="bookquote">``Underground,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Man</b></font>)</div>is shorter and set in the 1860s,
when the Underground Man is forty years old. This section serves
as an introduction to the character of the Underground Man, explaining
his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) theories about his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) antagonistic position toward society. The first words we hear from the Underground Man tell
us that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``a sick man ... a wicked man ... an unattractive
man''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whose self-loathing and spite has crippled and corrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a well-read and highly intelligent man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believes that
this fact accounts for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misery. The Underground Man explains
that, in modern society, all conscious and educated men should be
as miserable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) has become disillusioned with all philosophy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) has appreciation for the sublime, Romantic idea of <div class="bookquote">``the beautiful and
lofty,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is aware of its absurdity in the context of his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) narrow,
mundane existence. The Underground Man has great contempt for nineteenth--century
utilitarianism, a school of thought that attempted to use mathematical
formulas and logical proofs to align man's desires with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best
interests. The Underground Man complains that man's primary desire
is to exercise his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) free will, whether or not it is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) best interests.
In the face of utilitarianism, man will do nasty and unproductive
things simply to prove that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) free will is unpredictable and therefore
completely free. This assertion partially explains the Underground
Man's insistence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) takes pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) own toothaches or
liver pains: such pleasure in pain is a way of spiting the comfortable
predictability of life in modern society, which accepts without
question the value of going to the doctor. The Underground Man is
not proud of all this useless behavior, however. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) has enormous
contempt for himself as a human being. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is so
overcome by inertia that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) cannot even become wicked enough to
be a scoundrel, or insignificant enough to be an insect, or lazy
enough to be a true lazybones. The second fragment of Notes from Underground, entitled <div class="bookquote">``Apropos
of the Wet Snow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Man</b></font>)</div>describes specific events in the Underground Man's
life in the 1840s, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was twenty-four
years old. In a sense, this section serves as a practical illustration
of the more abstract ideas the Underground Man sets forth in the
first section. This second section reveals the narrator's progression
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) youthful perspective, influenced by Romanticism and ideals
of <div class="bookquote">``the beautiful and lofty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the narrator</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) mature perspective in 1860,
which is purely cynical about beauty, loftiness, and literariness
in general. <div class="bookquote">``Apropos of the Wet Snow''  (<font color='red'><b>the Man people soldiers</b></font>)</div>describes interactions between
the Underground Man and various people who inhabit his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) world: soldiers,
former schoolmates, and prostitutes. The Underground Man is so alienated
from these people that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is completely incapable of normal interaction
with them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) treats them with a mixture of disgust and fear that
results in his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) own effacement or humiliation--which in turn result
in remorse and self-loathing. The Underground Man's alienation manifests itself in all
kinds of relationships. When walking in the park, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) obsesses about
whether to yield the right of way to a soldier whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) does not
even know. Then, in a confused attempt at social interaction, the
Underground Man deliberately follows some school acquaintances to
a dinner where he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is not wanted, alternately insulting them openly
and craving their attention and friendship. Later that same evening,
the Underground Man attempts to rescue an attractive young prostitute named
Liza by delivering impassioned, sentimental speeches about the terrible
fate that awaits her (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) continues to sell her (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) body. When Liza comes to visit the Underground Man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) shoddy apartment
several days later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) reacts with shame and anger when he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) realizes
she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) has reason to pity or look down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>). The Underground Man
continues to insult Liza throughout the visit. Hurt and confused,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) apartment. Here the Underground Man decides to end his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) notes. In
a footnote at the end of the novel, Dostoevsky reveals that the
Underground Man fails to make even this simple decision to stop
writing, as Dostoevsky says that the manuscript of the notes goes
on for many pages beyond the point at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) has chosen to cut
it off.
