Peppering his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) narrative with frequent diary entries in which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chronicles his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) outrage against the behavior of the Ronald Reagan administration in the late 1980s, Wheelright tells the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) early life in Gravesend, New Hampshire, when his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) best friend was Owen Meany, who he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) remembers as the boy who accidentally killed Wheelwright's mother and made Wheelright believe in God. The narrative of A Prayer for Owen Meany does not follow a perfect chronology, as John pieces together the story he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wants to tell. Owen is a bizarre child. A tiny dwarf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) has weirdly luminous skin and an ethereally nasal voice -LRB-represented in the novel in all-capital letters-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) has a tremendous crush on John's mother, who, in turn, is very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) even intervenes with Owen's parents to ensure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) will be able to attend the elite Gravesend Academy for high school. John does not know who his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father is, though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) does know his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heritage: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) comes from the aristocratic Wheelwright family. Owen's parents, in contrast, are undistinguished parents who run a struggling granite quarry. Nonetheless, Owen assures John that God will help him (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) discover the identity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) father. John has always believed that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) one day, but this hope is dashed; one day at a Little League game, Owen, ordered to bat for John, hits a high foul ball that falls onto John's mother's head, breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck and killing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). John, brokenhearted, now splits his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) time between his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) grandmother's manor at 80 Front Street and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stepfather Dan Needham's apartment at Gravesend Academy, where Dan serves as a history and drama professor. John loves Dan, who becomes like a real father to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). John and Owen remain close friends. In December, 1953, six months after John's mother's death, John begins to realize just how remarkable Owen is. Simultaneously, Owen wins the role of the Baby Jesus in the Episcopalian Christmas pageant and the role of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come in an amateur theatrical production of A Christmas Carol. Owen brings the Christmas pageant to a halt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) accosts his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) parents in the middle of the performance, demanding that they leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) is chillingly good as the scary ghost in A Christmas Carol, but on the night of the final performance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) has a vision in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) own gravestone--complete with the date of his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) own death. Over time, as more and more details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) death are revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>), Owen comes to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) is God's instrument on Earth, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) is destined to die heroically. He (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) even believes that God caused him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to kill John's mother--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) accidentally interrupted the Angel of Death when it came to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and as a result, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was forced to do the job himself. Inscrutably, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) begins to make John practice something called <div class="bookquote">``The Shot,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>a basketball move in which John lifts Owen up for a slam dunk. They perform this maneuver over and over, trying to accomplish it as quickly as possible. PARGRAPH When the boys are old enough, they enter Gravesend Academy, where Owen thrives: he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) has a powerful column called <div class="bookquote">``THE VOICE''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in the school paper, and easily becomes the class valedictorian. Shortly before graduation, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) is expelled for helping students make fake IDs out of their draft cards--it is the early 1960s, and the Vietnam War is just beginning. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) expulsion, Owen removes a statue of Mary Magdalene from its place in front of a local Catholic school, amputates its arms and head, and welds it to the stage in the Gravesend Academy auditorium. The school minister, the doubt-plagued Rev. Louis Merrill, asks the boys at morning meeting to pray for Owen Meany, and the unpleasant headmaster who expelled Owen loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) job as a result of the event. Owen manages to graduate from the public high school, and John and Owen are reunited at the University of New Hampshire, where John majors in English; Owen develops a relationship with John's hypersexual cousin Hester. Owen is only able to pay for school by participating in an ROTC program, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) hopes for a combat assignment in Vietnam after graduation, to John and Hester's dismay. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is destined to die in Vietnam. However, because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is too short to climb over the obstacle-course wall, Owen is given an administrative assignment in Arizona. There, Owen campaigns actively for reassignment in Vietnam. John, meanwhile, attends graduate school. John does not want to go to Vietnam, and Owen helps to ensure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) friend will not have to go to war by amputating John's right-hand index finger with a diamond saw. In 1968, Owen begins working as a casualty-assistance officer, escorting the bodies of dead soldiers back to their families. One day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) calls John and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to meet for a few days in Phoenix, Arizona, where Owen is on assignment. John flies to Phoenix, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and Owen spend a few days relaxing; John meets the bereaved family Owen is then helping, which comes from a trashy part of town. John especially notices the dead soldier's younger brother, a hulking, menacing fifteen-year-old named Dick Jarvits, who lives for the day he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will be able to travel to Vietnam and slaughter the Vietnamese. When John and Owen go to the airport for John's return flight--on the day that Owen believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) is destined to die--they see a group of nuns escorting a column of Vietnamese war orphans through the halls. One of the nuns asks Owen to take the boys to a men's room; there, Dick Jarvits bursts in with a grenade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) hurls it at John, who tosses it to Owen; Owen leaps into the air, and John holds him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) up so that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) can thrust the grenade into a high window alcove--a move exactly like the The Shot. The children are shielded from the blast, but Owen's arms are blown off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) bleeds to death. Back in Gravesend and before Owen's funeral, John goes to see the Rev. Merrill. During the meeting, Owen's ghost possesses the reverend and causes him (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) to admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) is John's father. The reverend claims that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) prayed for John's mother to die just before the foul ball hit her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and that, in vengeance, God has turned his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). To restore his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father's faith, John plays a prank in which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) places a dressmaker's dummy in such a way as to make the reverend think he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is seeing John's mother's ghost. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) faith restored, the reverend delivers a passionate eulogy for Owen, calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``hero''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and pleading for God to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) back. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) house in Toronto, John remembers that also before the funeral, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) paid a visit to the Meanys, where Mr. Meany reveals a shocking fact: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) claims that Owen was a virgin birth, just like Jesus Christ. He (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) tells John that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) told Owen this when Owen was about eleven--about the same time that Owen accidentally killed John's mother. John considers this revelation monstrous, and says that it cannot be true. It remains unclear what John believes about Owen's parentage, however, and the mystery is never explained.
