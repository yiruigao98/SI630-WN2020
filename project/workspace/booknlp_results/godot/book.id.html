They converse on various topics and reveal that they are waiting there for a man named Godot. While they wait, two other men enter. Pozzo is on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way to the market to sell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slave, Lucky. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pauses for a while to converse with Vladimir and Estragon. Lucky entertains them by dancing and thinking, and Pozzo and Lucky leave. After Pozzo and Lucky leave, a boy enters and tells Vladimir that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vladimir</b></font>) is a messenger from Godot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vladimir</b></font>) tells Vladimir that Godot will not be coming tonight, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vladimir</b></font>) will surely come tomorrow. Vladimir asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Vladimir</b></font>) some questions about Godot and the boy departs. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Vladimir</b></font>) departure, Vladimir and Estragon decide to leave, but they do not move as the curtain falls. The next night, Vladimir and Estragon again meet near the tree to wait for Godot. Lucky and Pozzo enter again, but this time Pozzo is blind and Lucky is dumb. Pozzo does not remember meeting the two men the night before. They leave and Vladimir and Estragon continue to wait. Shortly after, the boy enters and once again tells Vladimir that Godot will not be coming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vladimir</b></font>) insists that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vladimir</b></font>) did not speak to Vladimir yesterday. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Vladimir</b></font>) leaves, Estragon and Vladimir decide to leave, but again they do not move as the curtain falls, ending the play.
