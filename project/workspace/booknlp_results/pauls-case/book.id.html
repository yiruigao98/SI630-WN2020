As the story opens, he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) arrives at a meeting with the school's faculty members and principal. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) is dressed in clothes that are simultaneously shabby and debonair. The red carnation he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) wears in his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) buttonhole particularly offends the faculty members, who think the flower sums up Paul's flippant attitude. Paul is tall and narrow-shouldered, with enlarged pupils that remind one of a drug addict's eyes. The faculty members have a difficult time articulating their true feelings about Paul. Deep down, they believe that Paul loathes, feels contempt for, and is repulsed by them. They lash out at Paul, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) betrays no emotion. Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) smiles throughout the barrage of criticism. After Paul leaves, the drawing master says aloud that Paul's mother died in Colorado just after Paul was born. Privately, the drawing master remembers seeing Paul asleep one day in class and being shocked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) aged appearance. As the teachers depart, they feel embarrassed about their viciousness toward Paul. Paul goes straight to Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) works as an usher. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is early, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) goes to the Hall's gallery and looks at paintings of Paris and Venice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loses himself in one particular painting, a <div class="bookquote">``blue Rico.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>After changing in the dressing room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rico</b></font>) roughhouses with the other ushers, Paul begins to work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is excellent at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) job, performing every aspect of it with great enthusiasm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is annoyed when his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) English teacher arrives and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) must seat her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) comforts himself with the knowledge that her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) clothes are inappropriate for so fancy a venue. The symphony begins, and Paul loses himself in the music. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) listens, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feels full of life. After the performance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) trails the star soprano to her (<font color='blue'><b>soprano</b></font>) hotel, the Schenley, and imagines vividly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is following her (<font color='blue'><b>soprano</b></font>) inside the luxurious building. As if awaking from a dream, Paul realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is actually standing in the cold, rainy street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dreads returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) room, with its ugly knickknacks and pictures of John Calvin and George Washington. As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) reaches Cordelia Street, where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lives, Paul feels depressed and repulsed by the commonness and ordinariness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) middle-class neighborhood. Unable to face his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father, Paul sneaks into the basement, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stays awake all night imagining what would happen if his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father mistook him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for a burglar and shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)--or recognized Paul in time, but later in life wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had shot his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) son. The next day, Paul sits on the porch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sisters and father. Many people are outside, relaxing. It is a pleasant scene, but Paul is disgusted by it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father chats with a young clerk whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hopes Paul will emulate. This clerk took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) boss's advice: he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) married the first woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could and began having children immediately. The only tales of business that interest Paul are those of the iron magnates' expensive adventures in Cairo, Venice, and Monte Carlo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) understands that some <div class="bookquote">``cash boys''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-low-level employees-RRB- eventually find great success, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) does not enjoy thinking about the initial cash-boy work. After managing to get carfare from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father by pretending that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) needs to study with a friend, Paul goes to see Charley Edwards, a young actor who lets Paul hang around his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dressing room and watch rehearsals. The narrator notes that Paul's mind has not been <div class="bookquote">``perverted''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul</b></font>)</div>by novels, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) teachers suspect. Rather, Paul gets pleasure solely from theater and music, which are the only things that make him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feel alive. At school, Paul tells outrageous lies about his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) close friendships with the members of the theater company and the stars who perform at Carnegie Hall. Paul's effort to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) classmates and teachers winds up alienating him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) from them. In the end, the principal speaks with Paul's father, and Paul is forbidden to return to school, Carnegie Hall, or the theater where Charley Edwards works. The theater company's members hear about Paul's lies and find them comical. Their lives are difficult, not the glamorous dream worlds that Paul imagines. Paul takes an overnight train and arrives in New York City, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) buys expensive clothes, hats, and shoes. After purchasing silver at Tiffany's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) checks into the Waldorf, paying for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rooms in advance. The eighth-floor rooms are nearly perfect. All that's missing are flowers, which Paul sends a bellboy out to buy. The narrator explains what has happened to make all this possible: Paul got a job with Denny & Carson's, and when asked to take a deposit to the bank, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) deposited only the checks and pocketed $1,000 in cash. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is using this stolen money to fund his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spree in New York. After a nap, Paul takes a carriage ride up Fifth Avenue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) notices banks of flowers, bright and vibrant, protected by glass from the snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dines at the hotel while listening to an orchestra play the Blue Danube. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feels utterly content. The next day, Paul meets a rich boy who attends Yale. The two of them enjoy a night on the town, staying out until 7 a.m.. The narrator notes that although the boys begin the evening in a happy mood, they end it in a bad one. A lovely week passes, and then Paul finds that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) theft has been discovered and reported by the Pittsburgh newspapers. According to the stories, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) father has paid back the $1,000 and is headed to New York to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) son. Paul enjoys one last dinner at the Waldorf. The next morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wakes up, hungover, and looks at the gun he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) purchased on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) first day in New York. In the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) takes cabs to a set of railroad tracks in Pennsylvania and leaps in front of an oncoming train. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) recognizes <div class="bookquote">``the folly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) haste''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and thinks of the places that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) will never see.
