At their pension, or guesthouse, in Florence, they are given rooms that look into the courtyard rather than out over the river Arno. Mr. Emerson, a fellow guest, generously offers them the rooms belonging to himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) son George. Although Charlotte is offended by Mr. Emerson's lack of tact and propriety, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) finally does agree to the switch. Lucy is an avid young pianist. Mr. Beebe, watches her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) passionate playing and predicts that someday she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) will live her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) life with as much gusto as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) plays the piano. Lucy's visit to Italy is marked by several significant encounters with the Emersons. In Santa Croce church, George complains that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father means well, but always offends everyone. Mr. Emerson tells Lucy that his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) son needs her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in order to overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Emerson</b></font>) youthful melancholy. Later, Lucy is walking in the Piazza Signoria, feeling dull, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) comes in close contact with two quarreling Italian men. One man stabs the other, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) faints, to be rescued by George. On their return trip home, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) surprise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) rash behavior a secret. On a country outing in the hills, Lucy wanders in search of Mr. Beebe and the supercilious chaplain, Mr. Eager. However, the Italian cab driver leads her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) instead to George, who is standing on a terrace covered with blue violets. George sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and again kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), but this time Charlotte sees him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and chastises him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) after they have resurnedreturned to the pension. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) leaves with Lucy for Rome the next day. The second half of the book centers on Lucy's home in Surrey, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lives with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, Mrs. Honeychurch, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brother, Freddy. A man she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) met in Rome, the snobbish Cecil Vyse, proposes marriage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) for the third time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) accepts him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) disapproves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) family and the country people she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knows, finding them coarse and unsophisticated. There is a small, ugly villa available for rent in the town, and as a joke, Cecil offers it to the Emersons, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) meets by chance in a museum. They take him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) up on the offer and move in, much to Lucy's initial horror. George plays tennis with the Honeychurches on a Sunday when Cecil is at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) most intolerable. After the game, Cecil reads from a book by Miss Lavish, a woman who also stayed with Lucy and Charlotte at the pension in Florence. The novel records a kiss among violets, and Lucy realizes that Charlotte let the secret out. In a moment alone, George kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) again. Lucy tells him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to leave, but George insists that Cecil is not the right man for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), characterizing Cecil as controlling and appreciative of things rather than people. Lucy sees Cecil in a new light, and breaks off her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) engagement that night. However, Lucy will not believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) loves George; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wants to stay unmarried and travel to Greece with some elderly women she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) met in Italy, the Miss Alans. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) meets old Mr. Emerson by chance, who insists that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) loves George and should marry him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), because it is what her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soul truly wants. Lucy realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is right, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must fly against convention, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) marries George, and the book ends with the happy couple staying together in the Florence pension again, in a room with a view. The book depicts Lucy's struggles as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) emerges as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own woman, growing from indecision to fulfillment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) struggles between strict, old-fashioned Victorian values and newer, more liberal mores. In this struggle Lucy's own idea of what is true evolves and matures. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) trip to Italy opens her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sheltered eyes to ideas and people unlike those she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has known growing up in the English countryside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) also notices how freely Italian classes seem to mix, and realizes that the social boundaries she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has always regarded as fixed are actually arbitrary. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) experience with the Emersons shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that there can be beauty in the things that are considered improper, and Charlotte's betrayal shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) that propriety is not always the best judge of what is true. Having more clearly found herself in Italy, Lucy's real test lies at home, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must confront her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) old familiar surroundings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is still uncertain, however, and confused about what to think about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) new experiences. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) missteps and becomes engaged to the pretentious and domineering Cecil shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) susceptibility to the pressures of society. As her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bold piano playing suggests, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is cut out for a more daring life, if only she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could cut herself away from the restricting social boundaries that engulf her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). The Emersons, as free-thinking, modern, truth-loving people, are her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) deliverers from the grips of society. It is this freedom that allows her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to see beyond the dictates of propriety that forbid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) marriage to the lower-class George and, therefore, to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart. George is troubled by existential worries in Italy. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) doesn't understand how life can be truly joyful and worthwhile when it is always shadowed by enigma, symbolized by the question mark that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hangs on the wall of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hotel. Lucy, though cautious, is loving by nature and enjoys life even when it challenges her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) understanding. The two are united by a shared appreciation for beauty, which might be captured in their love of views: Lucy adores the view of the Arno through the pension window, while George's first memory is of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) parents gazing at a view. Each possesses what the other needs: George finds simple joys staying with the Honeychurch family, while Lucy finds the courage to recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own individuality through her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) contact with the Emersons. A Room with a View is one of Forster's early works, and is not as complex as the more mature Howard's End and Passage to India. However, its strength lies in its vivid cast of characters, humorous dialogue, and comedic play upon the manners of the day, and in Forster's engaging, sympathetic exploration of Lucy's character.
