A giant monolith appeared on Earth one day and began to experiment with many of them, probing and developing their minds. Among those in whom the monolith took an interest was Moon-Watcher, the only man-ape who walked fully upright. At night, a few select man-apes were taught and during the day, they innovated. Moon-Watcher discovered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moon-Watcher</b></font>) could fashion tools with which to kill animals for sustenance--the man-apes' hunger problem was solved. Time passed and the man-ape evolved. His (<font color='blue'><b>Moon-Watcher</b></font>) brain grew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moon-Watcher</b></font>) invented language and organized into civilizations, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moon-Watcher</b></font>) invented weapons--first knives, but then guns and finally nuclear missiles. Such innovations had been central in man's dominion over earth, but <div class="bookquote">``as long as they existed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was living on borrowed time.''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>Eager to embark on another space mission, Dr. Heywood Floyd arrived at the Florida launch location after meeting with the president. He (<font color='blue'><b>Floyd</b></font>) offered no comment to the press, nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>Floyd</b></font>) reveal the details of mission to the crew that served him (<font color='blue'><b>Floyd</b></font>) so faithfully on board or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Floyd</b></font>) Russian friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Floyd</b></font>) encounters at the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. space station, a stop on his (<font color='blue'><b>Floyd</b></font>) journey to the Moon. Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Floyd</b></font>) arrival, Floyd is greeted by a top official of the Moon colony and whisked off to a meeting. A lead scientist explains that they had found a magnetic disturbance in Tycho, one of the Moon's craters. An examination of the area had revealed a large black slab, called Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-One -LRB-TMA-1-RRB-. It was precisely fashioned and, at three million years of age, predates humans. It is the first definitive proof of the existence of extra-terrestrial, intelligent life. Floyd and a team of scientists drive across the moon to actually view TMA- 1. When they uncover the giant, black slab and sunlight hits upon it for the first time, it sends forth a piercing sound and a strong wave signal to the far reaches of the universe. David Bowman and Frank Poole were the conscious human beings aboard the Discovery space mission to Saturn. Three of their colleagues were hibernating, to be woken when they approached Saturn. Additionally, Hal, an artificially intelligent computer maintained the ship and was an active part of life aboard. Bowman and Poole's day-to-day lives had been immaculately planned. Their days were highly structured to ensure the continued success of the mission and to make sure that nothing went wrong. The ship was nearing Jupiter. Here, it released probes to gather information to be sent back to Earth and studied. Discovery then took advantage of Jupiter's gravitational field to get an extra push and speed on toward Saturn. Poole is watching a birthday video transmitted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) family back home when Hal interrupts to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) that the AE-35 unit of the ship is set to malfunction. Poole takes one of the extra-vehicular pods and replaces the AE-35 unit, which is critical for maintaining radio contact with Earth. Bowman conducts tests on the AE-35 unit that has been replaced and discovers that nothing is wrong with it. Later, Hal claims that the second AE-35 unit is set to fail. Suspicious, Poole and Bowman radio back to Earth; they are told that something is wrong with Hal and are given instructions to shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) off. These instructions are interrupted as the signal fades--the AE-35 unit has malfunctioned. Poole and Bowman try begin to wonder how they will re-establish communication with Earth. Poole takes a Pod outside the ship to bring in the failed AE-35 unit. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) is working on dislodging the unit, the pod, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) had left further from the ship, begins moving toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) is unable to move out of the way in time and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) is killed by the collision. Bowman is shocked by Poole's death and is deeply distraught. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) wonders whether Hal really could have killed Poole. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) will need to wake the three other astronauts from their hibernation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) has a long argument with Hal, at the end of which, because Bowman threatens to disconnect him (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>), Hal agrees to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) manual control over the process of ending the hibernation. As Bowman is beginning to thaw out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) colleagues, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) feels a cold chill enter the ship. The airlock doors on bottom have been opened. Everything on the ship begins violently fluttering about. The pressure on board is significantly dropping as the ship is equilibrating with the vacuum outside. Bowman claws his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) way into a sealed emergency chamber where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) drinks from an emergency oxygen supply. Bowman then descends to the ship's innards and disconnects Hal, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) realizes has turned murderer. Bowman puts the ship back in order and re-establishes contact with Earth. Only then does he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) learn that the true purpose of the mission is to explore Japetus, a moon of Saturn, and learn more about the civilization that left TMA-1 behind on the Moon. Bowman learns that Hal had begun to feel guilty about keeping the purpose of the mission from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) and Poole. This had begun to manifest itself in little errors. Ultimately, when Hal was threatened with being shut off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) felt the need to defend himself, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) very existence were at stake. Bowman spends months on the ship, alone, preparing to rendezvous with Japetus. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) notices a small black spot on the moon. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) gets closer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) realizes that this is an immense black slab, similar to TMA-1, only much larger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) takes one of the extra-vehicular pods in an attempt to land on the slab. The slab, which had been inert for so long, opens and is full of stars. It swallows Bowman's pod and disappears from Japetus. Mission control never hears from Bowman again. Bowman was whisked through a field of stars that seemed as though it had no end. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) was released into a faraway world only to be swallowed back into the Star Gate and repeat the process again. Eventually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) is brought to what appears to be a nice hotel suite, carefully constructed to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) feel at home. Bowman lies down to go to sleep. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) sleeps, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) mind and memories are drained from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) body and preserved in a light structure. David Bowman is being made immortal and without a body. Bowman returns to our solar system and looks over Earth. A nuclear warhead has been fired; Bowman detonates the warhead in the air, saving the world from nuclear destruction.
