The three of them want to break into the Epsteins' grocery store where Alfred works. Although Alfred does not go with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) forgets about the new alarm system that the Epsteins just installed. James gets caught by the police, and later that night, Major and Hollis beat Alfred up. A man from the neighborhood, Henry, takes Alfred home. Henry mentions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has been working for Mr. Donatelli, who owns a gym where he (<font color='blue'><b>Donatelli</b></font>) trains some famous boxers. Alfred goes to check out the gym and tells Mr. Donatelli that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) wants to be special--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) wants to be a champion. Donatelli tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Donatelli</b></font>) that first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donatelli</b></font>) has to be a contender--someone for whom it is in the realm of possibility to be a champion. The next night, Henry, Spoon, Jelly Belly, and Mr. Donatelli take Alfred to a boxing match at Madison Square Garden. Mr. Donatelli's most promising boxer, Willie Streeter, is competing in an important match. During the match, Streeter gets hurt, and Donatelli eventually concedes. Although Streeter is angry, Spoon says that Donatelli is the best manager around. Alfred begins training for boxing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) runs, eats, and sleeps exactly in the way Mr. Donatelli prescribes. After six weeks of very hard work, Alfred becomes discouraged because he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) has never been in a real fight--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) has only trained, exercised, and hit punching bags. Succumbing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) frustration and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) loneliness in having been separated from James, Alfred goes to a party thrown by Major, partially because of a promise that James would be there. Alfred resists the drugs and alcohol at first, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) indulges. Eventually, James shows up but Alfred barely gets to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)--James is more interested in the heroin that Major offers him (<font color='blue'><b>Major</b></font>). Alfred goes to Coney Island with Major the next day, narrowly missing a run-in with the police for Major's possession of a stolen car. The next few days Alfred is in a stupor and eventually goes back to the gym to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) clothes and equipment. While there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) asks Mr. Donatelli if he (<font color='blue'><b>Donatelli</b></font>) could have been a contender. Mr. Donatelli answers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donatelli</b></font>) does not know and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donatelli</b></font>) never knows the answer to that question until he (<font color='blue'><b>Donatelli</b></font>) sees how a boxer reacts to getting hurt. Needing to know the answer to that question himself, Alfred begins training again. Alfred's progress is speedy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) learns that Mr. Epstein used to box as well, and the two of them begin to develop a renewed trust at work. Despite the protests of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) Aunt Pearl, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) trains until he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) is ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) first fight. Spoon, Henry, and Jelly Belly take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that day by letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) relax, eat, and sleep. Alfred wins his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) first match by majority decision. Aunt Pearl questions him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) later, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) admits that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) did not enjoy winning much but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) refuses to quit. During his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) second fight, Alfred hits his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) opponent so hard that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) opponent gets knocked unconscious. Alfred is sickened by the scene and is upset at the brutality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) own actions. Mr. Epstein, proud and impressed, pays for Alfred's lessons. Spoon tells Alfred that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) should consider going to night school, and Alfred later reveals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) is planning on getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) high school diploma. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) third fight, Donatelli tells Alfred it is time to retire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) says that Alfred does not have the requisite killer instinct. Alfred protests and says that while that may be true, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) still doesn't <div class="bookquote">``know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>yet, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) has never been injured in the ring. Donatelli eventually lets Alfred persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) into fighting one more match. Alfred faces an opponent who is bigger, stronger, and better in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) final match, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) lasts through all the rounds. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) loses by majority decision, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) knows that the strength and bravery he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) displayed in the round is something of which to be proud. Satisfied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) retires. That night Alfred learns that James has tried to break into the Epsteins' store again. Aunt Pearl tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) that the police are looking for James and will probably find him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), because James cut himself and was bleeding badly. Alfred finds James in their old hideout in Central Park and convinces James to go to the hospital. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) assures James that together, they will beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) drug addiction, find him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) a job, and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) get back on track.
