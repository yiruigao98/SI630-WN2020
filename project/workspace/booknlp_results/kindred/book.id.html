it is the twenty-sixth birthday of Dana, a young black woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>)
and Kevin Franklin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) white husband, move into their new apartment
in Southern California. Dana does the majority of the unpacking
and settling in; Kevin focuses on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kevin</b></font>) office and then stops helping.
Dana gets dizzy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) surroundings fade away. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) comes
to, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) finds herself in the early 1800s
in Maryland. A young white boy named Rufus is struggling in a river.
Dana wades in after him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) is unconscious by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) reaches
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) drags him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) to the shore and resuscitates him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>). Tom Weylin,
Rufus's father, arrives and points a gun at Dana, terrifying her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>).
Following another dizzy spell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) reappears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) apartment in 1976. Several minutes later, Dana again gets dizzy and disappears.
This time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) is whisked back to 1815. Rufus,
now a few years older, watches in horror as his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) bedroom drapes burn.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) had set fire to them because he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) was angry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) father for
selling a horse he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) wanted. Dana puts out the fire, talks to Rufus,
and escapes from the house before Weylin finds out she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) is there.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) runs to the home of Alice Greenwood and her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenwood</b></font>) mother, free blacks
who Dana suspects may be her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) ancestors. A group of young white men
smash down the Greenwoods' door, drag out Alice's husband, who is
a slave, and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>). They also beat Alice's mother. After the
men leave, Dana comes out of hiding and helps Alice's mother. Dana
steps outside, and a returning white man finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>), beats her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>), and
attempts to rape her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>). Dana fears for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) life. Following another
dizzy spell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) returns home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) own time. The next time Dana time travels, Kevin comes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>)
by holding onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>). Back at the Weylins', Rufus has fallen out
of a tree and broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) leg. Nigel, a young black boy, runs for
help, and Weylin comes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nigel</b></font>) slave, Luke. Rufus will not let
Dana leave, so everyone returns to the house together. Kevin and
Dana stay on the plantation for several weeks and help educate Rufus.
But when Dana gets caught teaching Nigel to read, Weylin whips her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>).
Dana returns to 1976, but Kevin does not
arrive in time to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>). After eight days at home, Dana time travels back and finds
that Kevin has left the Maryland area and that Rufus has raped Alice Greenwood.
Alice's husband, Isaac, a slave, is beating Rufus badly. Dana convinces
Isaac not to kill Rufus, and Alice and Isaac run away while Dana
gets Rufus home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) stays in Maryland for two months. Although
Rufus lies about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) got injured, Alice and Isaac are caught,
and Alice is beaten and ravaged by dogs. As punishment for helping
Isaac escape, Alice is made a slave. Rufus, who is in love with
Alice, buys her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) forces Dana to convince Alice to sleep with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) body has recovered. After Rufus fails to mail her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>)
letters to Kevin, Dana attempts to run away. As a result, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) receives
a vicious whipping, which so hurts and frightens her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) loses
the will to run away again. Kevin shows up, as Weylin had written
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kevin</b></font>), and the couple attempts to escape. Rufus catches them on
the road and shoots at them, but they manage to time travel together
back to the 1970s. After a few days, Dana time travels by herself back to
Maryland and finds Rufus very drunk and lying facedown in a puddle.
Weylin refuses to get a doctor. Over the course of many days, Dana
nurses Rufus back to health. Rufus remains weak for weeks. Weylin
has a heart attack, and Dana is unable to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>). Rufus blames
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) father's death and forces her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) to work in the fields
until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) collapses. Rufus is much harsher with Alice than he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) is with Dana.
Alice is jealous of the kindness with which Rufus treats Dana. Alice
gives birth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) second child with Rufus, Hagar, who is Dana's
direct ancestor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) tells Dana that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) plans to run away as soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) can. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) fears that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) is getting too used to Rufus, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) doesn't hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) enough anymore. Weylin's wife, Margaret, returns.
Dana is forced to care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>). Rufus sells off some slaves, including
Tess, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) father's former consort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) also sells Sam, a field hand,
as punishment for flirting with Dana. When Dana tries to interfere,
Rufus hits her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) slits her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) wrists in an effort to time travel
and is successful. Dana is back at home for many days. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) and Kevin quarrel
a little about Rufus. Kevin is jealous of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kevin</b></font>) relationship with
Dana, which Dana finds ridiculous. When Dana returns to the plantation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>)
finds that Alice has attempted to run away. To retaliate, Rufus told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) sold her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) children, although actually he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) only sent them
off to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) aunt in Baltimore. Alice is sick with grief and
eventually kills herself. Racked with guilt and anger about Alice's
death, Rufus nearly kills himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) keeps Dana at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) side almost
constantly. One day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) is so like Alice he (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) cannot
stand it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) catches her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by the wrists, and Dana struggles free.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) goes to the attic, planning to slit her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) wrists in order to get home,
but Rufus follows her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) and attempts to rape her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>). Dana stabs him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>) twice
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) knife, killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rufus</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) returns home immediately. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dana</b></font>) arm
is severed and crushed in the spot where Rufus was holding it.
