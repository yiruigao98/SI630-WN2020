raised by Mrs. Reed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) cruel, wealthy aunt. A servant named Bessie
provides Jane with some of the few kindnesses she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) receives, telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) stories and singing songs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>). One day, as punishment for
fighting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) bullying cousin John Reed, Jane's aunt imprisons Jane
in the red-room, the room in which Jane's Uncle Reed died. While
locked in, Jane, believing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) uncle's ghost, screams
and faints. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wakes to find herself in the care of Bessie and the
kindly apothecary Mr. Lloyd, who suggests to Mrs. Reed that Jane
be sent away to school. To Jane's delight, Mrs. Reed concurs. Once at the Lowood School, Jane finds that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) life is
far from idyllic. The school's headmaster is Mr. Brocklehurst, a
cruel, hypocritical, and abusive man. Brocklehurst preaches a doctrine
of poverty and privation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) students while using the school's
funds to provide a wealthy and opulent lifestyle for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) own family.
At Lowood, Jane befriends a young girl named Helen Burns, whose strong,
martyrlike attitude toward the school's miseries is both helpful
and displeasing to Jane. A massive typhus epidemic sweeps Lowood,
and Helen dies of consumption. The epidemic also results in the
departure of Mr. Brocklehurst by attracting attention to the insalubrious
conditions at Lowood. After a group of more sympathetic gentlemen
takes Brocklehurst's place, Jane's life improves dramatically. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
spends eight more years at Lowood, six as a student and two as a
teacher. After teaching for two years, Jane yearns for new experiences. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
accepts a governess position at a manor called Thornfield, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) teaches a lively French girl named Ad√®le. The distinguished
housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax presides over the estate. Jane's employer
at Thornfield is a dark, impassioned man named Rochester, with whom
Jane finds herself falling secretly in love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saves Rochester
from a fire one night, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) claims was started by a drunken
servant named Grace Poole. But because Grace Poole continues to
work at Thornfield, Jane concludes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) has not been told the
entire story. Jane sinks into despondency when Rochester brings
home a beautiful but vicious woman named Blanche Ingram. Jane expects
Rochester to propose to Blanche. But Rochester instead proposes
to Jane, who accepts almost disbelievingly. The wedding day arrives, and as Jane and Mr. Rochester
prepare to exchange their vows, the voice of Mr. Mason cries out
that Rochester already has a wife. Mason introduces himself as the
brother of that wife--a woman named Bertha. Mr. Mason testifies that
Bertha, whom Rochester married when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was a young man in Jamaica,
is still alive. Rochester does not deny Mason's claims, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) explains that
Bertha has gone mad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) takes the wedding party back to Thornfield,
where they witness the insane Bertha Mason scurrying around on all
fours and growling like an animal. Rochester keeps Bertha hidden
on the third story of Thornfield and pays Grace Poole to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>)
wife under control. Bertha was the real cause of the mysterious
fire earlier in the story. Knowing that it is impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertha</b></font>) to
be with Rochester, Jane flees Thornfield. Penniless and hungry, Jane is forced to sleep outdoors
and beg for food. At last, three siblings who live in a manor alternatively
called Marsh End and Moor House take her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) in. Their names are Mary, Diana,
and St. John -LRB-pronounced <div class="bookquote">``Sinjin'' (<font color='red'><b>John/St. John</b></font>)</div>-RRB- Rivers, and Jane quickly becomes
friends with them. St. John is a clergyman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) finds Jane a
job teaching at a charity school in Morton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) surprises her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) one
day by declaring that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) uncle, John Eyre, has died and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a
large fortune: 20,000 pounds. When
Jane asks how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) received this news, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shocks her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) further by declaring
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) uncle was also his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) uncle: Jane and the Riverses are cousins.
Jane immediately decides to share her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) inheritance equally with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
three newfound relatives. St. John decides to travel to India as a missionary, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) urges Jane to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)--as his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wife. Jane agrees to go to
India but refuses to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cousin because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) does not love
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). St. John pressures her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to reconsider, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) nearly gives
in. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) realizes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cannot abandon forever the man
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) truly loves when one night she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hears Rochester's voice calling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) name over the moors. Jane immediately hurries back to Thornfield
and finds that it has been burned to the ground by Bertha Mason,
who lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) life in the fire. Rochester saved the servants but
lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyesight and one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands. Jane travels on to Rochester's
new residence, Ferndean, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lives with two servants named
John and Mary. At Ferndean, Rochester and Jane rebuild their relationship
and soon marry. At the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) story, Jane writes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) has
been married for ten blissful years and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and Rochester enjoy
perfect equality in their life together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) says that after two
years of blindness, Rochester regained sight in one eye and was
able to behold their first son at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) birth.
