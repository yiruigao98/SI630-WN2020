He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is deaf and likes when the night grows still. Two waiters watch the old man carefully because they know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't pay if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets too drunk. One waiter tells the other that the old man tried to kill himself because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in despair. The other waiter asks why he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) felt despair, and the first waiter says the reason was <div class="bookquote">``nothing''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>because the man has a lot of money. The waiters look at the empty tables and the old man, who sits in the shadow of a tree. They see a couple walk by, a soldier with a girl. One of the waiters says the soldier had better be careful about being out because the guards just went by. The old man taps his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass against its saucer and asks the younger waiter for a brandy. The younger waiter tells him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)'ll get drunk, then goes back and tells the older waiter that the old man will stay all night. The younger waiter says he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) never goes to bed earlier than 3 a.m. and that the old man should have killed himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes the old man his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brandy. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pours it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tells the old man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have killed himself, but the old man just indicates that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants more brandy in the glass. The younger waiter tells the older waiter that the old man is drunk, then asks again why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to kill himself. The older waiter says he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) doesn't know. The younger waiter asks how he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) did it. The older waiter says he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) tried to hang himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) niece found him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) and got him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) down. The younger waiter asks why she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) got him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) down, and the older waiter says they were concerned about his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) soul. The waiters speculate on how much money the old man has and decide he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s probably age eighty. The younger waiter says he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) wishes the old man would leave so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can go home and go to bed with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. The older waiter says that the old man was married at one time. The younger waiter says a wife wouldn't do him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) any good, but the older waiter disagrees. The younger waiter points out that the old man has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) niece, then says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't want to be an old man. The older waiter points out that the old man is clean and drinks neatly. The younger waiter says again that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) wishes the old man would leave. The old man indicates that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants another brandy, but the younger waiter tells him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) they're closing. The old man pays and walks away. The older waiter asks the younger waiter why he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) didn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) drink more because it's not even 3 a.m. yet, and the younger waiter says he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) wants to go home. The older waiter says an hour doesn't make much difference. The younger waiter says that the old man can just drink at home, but the older waiter says it's different. The younger waiter agrees. The older waiter jokingly asks if the younger waiter is afraid to go home early. The younger waiter says he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) has confidence. The older waiter points out that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) also has youth and a job, whereas the older waiter has only a job. The older waiter says that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) likes to stay at cafés very late with the others who are reluctant to go home and who need light during the nighttime. The younger waiter says he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) wants to go home, and the older waiter remarks that they are very different. The older waiter says he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) doesn't like to close the café in case someone needs it. The younger waiter says there are bars to go to, but the older waiter says that the café is clean and well lit. They wish each other good night. The older waiter continues thinking to himself about how important it is for a café to be clean and well lit. He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) thinks that music is never good to have at a café and that standing at a bar isn't good either. He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) wonders what he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)'s afraid of, deciding it's not fear but just a familiar nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) says two prayers but substitutes <div class="bookquote">``nada''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Spanish for <div class="bookquote">``nothing'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-RRB- for most of the words. When he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) arrives at a bar, he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) orders a drink and tells the bartender that the bar isn't clean. The bartender offers another drink, but the waiter leaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) doesn't like bars, preferring cafés. He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) will now go home and fall asleep when the sun comes up. He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) just has insomnia, a common problem.
