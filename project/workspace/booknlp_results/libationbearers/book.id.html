Orestes has been living in exile and has come back to Argos in secret, sent by an oracle of Apollo. His (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) mission is to exact vengeance for Agamemnon's death upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) murderers. Apollo has threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) with horrible punishments, including leprosy and further exile, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) does not agree to accept this quest. While standing at Agamemnon's grave, Orestes meets up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) sister Electra, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) has not seen since he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) was a child. There is a protracted recognition scene and then a subsequent joyful reunion. Electra explains that she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) was sent to the grave by their mother, Clytamnestra, to bring libations to Agamemnon in the hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) could quiet the source of Clytamnestra's terrible dreams. Orestes and Electra, encouraged by the chorus, discuss how much they love their father and hate their mother, and pray together in order to invoke the spirit of Agamemnon to come to their aid in their quest for vengeance. Orestes and Electra engage in wishful thinking about how their father could have lived, but the chorus urges them to focus on the present and to act on their anger. Together, Orestes and Electra plot to avenge Agamemnon's death. With the eager support of the chorus, Orestes concocts a plan wherein he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) will gain admittance to the palace and kill Aigisthos on the throne. Electra and the chorus are complicit, and disappear back into the palace. Unexpectedly, Clytamnestra comes to the door when Orestes knocks, thus forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) to fabricate a story about his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) origins. He (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) claims to be a stranger bearing sad news of the death of Orestes. Clytamnestra laments, and sends Cilissa, Orestes's old nurse, to tell Aigisthos to come with his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) bodyguard to hear the news. The chorus intervenes, intercepting Clytamnestra's message, and tells Cilissa to compel Aigisthos to come alone, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) guard. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) does not understand why the chorus seems so gleeful, since she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) assumes that Orestes is dead, Cilissa does as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is told. Aigisthos appears briefly on stage, after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) goes back into the palace to meet Orestes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) death is announced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) servant, who cries out for Clytamnestra to come and see what's happening. Alarmed at all the shouting, Clytamnestra appears and immediately realizes that something is horribly wrong. The doors open, and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) sees Orestes over the fallen body of Aigisthos. The climax of the play follows, as Orestes resolves to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) vengeance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) hesitates at the crucial moment, however, when Clytamnestra bares her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast to him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) and implores him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) to respect their filial bonds. Pylades steps in at this moment, and reminds Orestes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) duty to Apollo. Orestes regains his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) resolve and deflects all of Clytamnestra's pitiful arguments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) stabs her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and the chorus rejoices. He (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) wraps the two bodies in the same shroud in which Agamemnon was killed, and announces to the world that he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) has carried out the commands of Justice. However, now that the deed is finally done, Orestes falls victim to the Furies's retributive violence. He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) goes mad and flees the stage in the direction of Delphi, where he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) will seek refuge at Apollo's shrine. The chorus despairs at the end of the play that the cycle of bloodshed has not stopped with Orestes's action, but continues ever still.
