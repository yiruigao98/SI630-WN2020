brilliant poet and swordsman named Cyrano de Bergerac finds himself
deeply in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) beautiful, intellectual cousin Roxane. Despite
Cyrano's brilliance and charisma, a shockingly large nose afflicts
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) appearance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) considers himself too ugly even to risk telling Roxane
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) feelings. One night, Cyrano goes to the playhouse at the Hotel
de Bourgogne to make trouble: he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) has forbidden the actor Montfleury
to take the stage for one month, but Montfleury plans to perform
in the night's production of La Clorise, with Roxane
in the audience. Also in the audience is a young, handsome nobleman
named Christian, who confides in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) friend Ligniere that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) loves
Roxane. When Montfleury takes the stage, Cyrano bullies him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) off
it. A group of aristocrats tries to send Cyrano away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) challenges them
all to a duel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) fights Valvert, a Vicomte whom the Comte de Guiche
has selected as a husband for Roxane. As he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fights, Cyrano improvises
a poem about the duel. Then, upon speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) last line, Cyrano
thrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) sword home. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) victory causes a sensation, and Roxane's
duenna brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) a message from her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) mistress, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) to meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) in the morning. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) agrees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) learns that Ligniere has offended
a powerful nobleman with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) latest satire and that a hundred men
are waiting to ambush him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) way home. Cyrano boldly proclaims
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) will see Ligniere safely home and, if necessary, fight all
hundred men in the process. The next morning, Cyrano meets Roxane at Ragueneau's
pastry shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) nearly tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) feelings, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) confides
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) loves Christian, who will soon join Cyrano's company
of guards, the Cadets of Gascoyne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) asks Cyrano to protect Christian,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) agrees. Outside, a crowd has gathered, buzzing with the news about
Cyrano's triumphs the night before. Cyrano angrily ignores them,
upset by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) meeting with Roxane. When the cadets arrive, Christian
tries to prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) courage by insulting Cyrano's nose--an act generally
considered fatal. Instead of killing Christian, however, Cyrano
embraces him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) about Roxane's feelings. Delighted at
first, Christian then becomes distraught. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) considers Roxane an
intellectual and sees himself as a simple, unpoetic man. Then Cyrano
has a bright idea: Cyrano can write to Roxane -pretending to be
Christian. Christian agrees, welcoming the opportunity to reach
Roxane's heart. Now, Cyrano can express all his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) thoughts and feelings
secretly. One night soon after, Roxane confides in Cyrano that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) thinks Christian is the most ravishing poet in the world. Cyrano's
disguised letters have moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) inexpressibly. Christian tells
Cyrano he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) no longer wants Cyrano's help, and then makes a fool of
himself trying to speak seductively to Roxane. Roxane storms into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) house, confused and angry. Thinking quickly, Cyrano makes Christian
stand in front of Roxane's balcony and speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) while Cyrano
stands under the balcony whispering to Christian what to say. Eventually, Cyrano
shoves Christian aside and, under cover of darkness, pretends to
be Christian, wooing Roxane himself. In the process, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) wins a kiss
for Christian. Roxane and Christian are secretly married by a Capuchin,
but their happiness is short-lived: de Guiche, angry to have lost
Roxane, declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is sending the Cadets of Gascoyne to the
front lines of the war with Spain. At the siege of Arras, the cadets languish and suffer
from hunger. Cyrano writes to Roxane every single day, using Christian's
name. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) risks his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) life each morning by sneaking through
the Spanish lines to a place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) can send the letters. De Guiche reveals
that the Spaniards will attack within the hour. Suddenly, a coach
arrives and Roxane climbs out of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) has longed to see Christian,
again and brings a feast to the soldiers. But Christian has guessed
Cyrano's secret feelings for Roxane, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) forces Cyrano to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) the truth and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) choose between them. On the cusp of revealing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) feelings, Cyrano is interrupted by a sudden gunshot that kills
Christian. Cyrano cannot tell Roxane the truth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) faints, and
de Guiche redeems himself by taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) to safety while Cyrano charges
into the battle. Fifteen years later, Roxane lives in a convent, and Cyrano
visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) every week. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) friend Le Bret informs Roxane that Cyrano
is doing very poorly--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) has made many powerful enemies, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) life
is constantly in danger. Then, Ragueneau rushes in and privately tells
Le Bret that Cyrano has been ambushed and hit with a heavy log pushed
out of a high window. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) health severely jeopardized, Cyrano could
die by simply raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) head from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) pillow. Le Bret and Ragueneau
rush off to their friend's side. No sooner have they gone than Cyrano
appears at the convent, walking slowly and with a pained expression
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) face, but sounding as cheerful as ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) gives Roxane a
news update. As night falls, Cyrano asks to read Christian's last letter
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) reads it, and when it is completely dark, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) continues
to read, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) knows the letter by heart. Roxane realizes that
Cyrano wrote the letters--she (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) has found the soul she (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) was in love
with all along. Upset, Ragueneau and Le Bret rush in, proclaiming
that Cyrano has killed himself by getting out of bed. Cyrano removes
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) hat, revealing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) heavily bandaged head. Roxane exclaims that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Roxane</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) cannot die. But Cyrano draws his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) sword
and engages in one last fight with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``old enemies'' (<font color='red'><b>Cyrano</b></font>)</div>--falsehood,
prejudice, and compromise--slashing at the air insensibly. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>)
collapses and dies, smiling as Roxane bends over him (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) and kisses
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cyrano</b></font>) face.
