His (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) clerk, Bob Cratchit, shivers in the anteroom because Scrooge refuses to spend money on heating coals for a fire. Scrooge's nephew, Fred, pays his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle a visit and invites him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) annual Christmas party. Two portly gentlemen also drop by and ask Scrooge for a contribution to their charity. Scrooge reacts to the holiday visitors with bitterness and venom, spitting out an angry <div class="bookquote">``Bah! Humbug!''  (<font color='red'><b>the holiday visitors</b></font>)</div>in response to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) nephew's <div class="bookquote">``Merry Christmas!''  (<font color='red'><b>nephew Christmas</b></font>)</div>Later that evening, after returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) dark, cold apartment, Scrooge receives a chilling visitation from the ghost of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) dead partner, Jacob Marley. Marley, looking haggard and pallid, relates his (<font color='blue'><b>Marley</b></font>) unfortunate story. As punishment for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marley</b></font>) greedy and self-serving life his (<font color='blue'><b>Marley</b></font>) spirit has been condemned to wander the Earth weighted down with heavy chains. Marley hopes to save Scrooge from sharing the same fate. Marley informs Scrooge that three spirits will visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) during each of the next three nights. After the wraith disappears, Scrooge collapses into a deep sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) wakes moments before the arrival of the Ghost of Christmas Past, a strange childlike phantom with a brightly glowing head. The spirit escorts Scrooge on a journey into the past to previous Christmases from the curmudgeon's earlier years. Invisible to those he (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) watches, Scrooge revisits his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) childhood school days, his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) apprenticeship with a jolly merchant named Fezziwig, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) engagement to Belle, a woman who leaves Scrooge because his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) lust for money eclipses his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) ability to love another. Scrooge, deeply moved, sheds tears of regret before the phantom returns him (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) bed. The Ghost of Christmas Present, a majestic giant clad in a green fur robe, takes Scrooge through London to unveil Christmas as it will happen that year. Scrooge watches the large, bustling Cratchit family prepare a miniature feast in its meager home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) discovers Bob Cratchit's crippled son, Tiny Tim, a courageous boy whose kindness and humility warms Scrooge's heart. The specter then zips Scrooge to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) nephew's to witness the Christmas party. Scrooge finds the jovial gathering delightful and pleads with the spirit to stay until the very end of the festivities. As the day passes, the spirit ages, becoming noticeably older. Toward the end of the day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) shows Scrooge two starved children, Ignorance and Want, living under his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) coat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) vanishes instantly as Scrooge notices a dark, hooded figure coming toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>). The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come leads Scrooge through a sequence of mysterious scenes relating to an unnamed man's recent death. Scrooge sees businessmen discussing the dead man's riches, some vagabonds trading his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) personal effects for cash, and a poor couple expressing relief at the death of their unforgiving creditor. Scrooge, anxious to learn the lesson of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) latest visitor, begs to know the name of the dead man. After pleading with the ghost, Scrooge finds himself in a churchyard, the spirit pointing to a grave. Scrooge looks at the headstone and is shocked to read his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) own name. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) desperately implores the spirit to alter his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) fate, promising to renounce his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) insensitive, avaricious ways and to honor Christmas with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) heart. Whoosh! He (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) suddenly finds himself safely tucked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) bed. Overwhelmed with joy by the chance to redeem himself and grateful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) has been returned to Christmas Day, Scrooge rushes out onto the street hoping to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) newfound Christmas spirit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) sends a giant Christmas turkey to the Cratchit house and attends Fred's party, to the stifled surprise of the other guests. As the years go by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) holds true to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) promise and honors Christmas with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) heart: he (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) treats Tiny Tim as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) were his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) own child, provides lavish gifts for the poor, and treats his (<font color='blue'><b>Scrooge</b></font>) fellow human beings with kindness, generosity, and warmth.
