Gus walks to the kitchen door, then stops and takes a flattened matchbox out of one shoe, and a flattened cigarette carton out of the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) puts both items in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) pocket and leaves for the bathroom. There's a sound of the toilet chain being pulled without it flushing, and Gus returns. Ben reports to Gus a newspaper article about a truck running over an elderly man. Ben orders Gus to make tea. Gus hopes, <div class="bookquote">``it won't be a long job.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gus</b></font>)</div>Ben reports on an article about a child who kills a cat. Gus asks if Ben has noticed how long it takes for the toilet tank to fill. Gus complains he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) didn't sleep well on the bed, and wishes that there were a window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) laments that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) life revolves around sleeping all day in an unfamiliar, dark room, then performing a job, and then leaving at night. Ben tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) they are fortunate to be employed. Gus asks if Ben ever gets fed up, but they soon fall silent. The toilet finally flushes. Ben commands him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) to make tea, as they will go to work very soon. Gus asks Ben why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) stopped the car that morning in the middle of the road. Ben says they were early. Ben tells Gus they are in the city of Birmingham. Gus wants to watch the Birmingham soccer team tomorrow -LRB-Saturday-RRB-, but Ben says that there is no time and that they have to get back. Gus speaks about a Birmingham game they once saw together, but Ben denies it. An envelope slides under the door. Neither one knows what is in the envelope. Ben orders Gus to pick it up and open it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) does, and empties out twelve matches. They are confused, and Ben commands Gus to open the door and see if anyone is outside. With a revolver for protection, Gus finds no one. Gus says the matches will come in handy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) always runs out. Ben tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) to light the kettle instead. They debate the phrase <div class="bookquote">``light the kettle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gus</b></font>)</div>Gus feels one should say the <div class="bookquote">``gas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gus</b></font>)</div>since that is what is being lit, or <div class="bookquote">``put on the kettle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gus</b></font>)</div>a phrase his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) mother used. Ben denies this and challenges Gus to remember the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) mother. After further arguments about the phrase, in which Ben reminds Gus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) has seniority, Ben chokes Gus and screams <div class="bookquote">``THE KETTLE, YOU FOOL!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gus</b></font>)</div>Gus acquiesces and tries to see if the matches will light. They don't light on the flattened box, but they work on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) foot. Ben says, <div class="bookquote">``Put on the bloody kettle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>then realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) has used Gus's phrase. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) then stares at Gus until he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) leaves. Gus comes back, having lit the kettle, and wonders, <div class="bookquote">``who it'll be tonight.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gus</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) wants to ask Ben something, and sits on Ben's bed, which annoys him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>). Ben asks Gus why he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) barrages him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) with so many questions, and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) job and shut up. After Gus repeatedly asks who it's going to be tonight and a moment of silence, Ben orders him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) to make tea. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) leaves, Ben checks his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) revolver under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) pillow for ammunition. Gus returns and says that the gas has gone out and the meter needs to be refilled with coins. Ben says they'll have to wait for Wilson. Gus says that Wilson doesn't always come--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) sometimes sends only a message. Gus argues that since no one ever hears anything, Wilson must own all the places they go to; Ben says Wilson rents them. Gus also finds it hard to talk to Wilson, and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>)'s been thinking about the <div class="bookquote">``last one'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--a girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) remembers the job was a <div class="bookquote">``mess.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) wonders who <div class="bookquote">``clears up''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>after they leave. Ben reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) that there are many <div class="bookquote">``departments''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>in their <div class="bookquote">``organization''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that take care of other matters. They are interrupted by a sound from the wall. They investigate and find a box on a dumb waiter -LRB-a small elevator used for conveying food and dishes between stories of a building-RRB-. Gus pulls a piece of paper out, and reads out an order for food. The dumb waiter ascends. Ben explains that the upstairs used to be a caf√©, the basement was the kitchen, and that these places change ownership quickly. The dumb waiter descends again, and Gus pulls out another order for food. Gus looks up the hatch, but Ben pushes him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) away. Ben decides they should send something up, but they have only a little food. They put everything on a plate, but the dumb waiter ascends before they can put the plate on it. The box descends again with another order, this time for <div class="bookquote">``high class''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exotic food. They put the plate on and Gus calls up the brand names of the food. Ben tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) not to shout, as <div class="bookquote">``It isn't done.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Gus then discusses, without Ben's answering, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) feelings of anxiety about the job and Wilson. Another order comes down the passage for more food with which they are unfamiliar. The packet of tea they sent up has also returned. Ben decides they should write a note telling them they can't fill the orders, but then they notice an intercom tube. Gus yells into the tube that there is no food. Ben gives Gus the instructions for the job. They must corner the target with guns when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) enters the room. Gus excuses himself to the bathroom, where the toilet again does not flush, and returns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) asks Ben who is upstairs. They argue, and Gus wants to know why they have to play these <div class="bookquote">``games.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gus</b></font>)</div>Ben hits him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) twice on the shoulder. Another order comes, they fight again, and then they retreat into silence, Ben reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) newspaper, as the dumb waiter goes up and comes down again. Gus leaves to get a drink of water, and the speaking tube whistle blows. Ben listens through the tube and confirms that it is time to do their job. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) hangs up and calls for Gus. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) levels his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) gun at the door and Gus stumbles in, vulnerably stripped of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) clothes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) gun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gus</b></font>) looks up at Ben, and they stare at each other through a long silence.
