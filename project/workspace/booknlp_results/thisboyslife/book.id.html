While in Utah, Toby changes his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) name to Jack in honor of the author ##Jack London# and also to remove himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father, who abandoned Jack and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mother shortly after Jack was born. Jack's father is now living in Connecticut with Jack's brother, Geoffrey, a student at Princeton, and is married to a millionaress. Jack shares an intimate closeness with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mother who, because of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own abusive childhood, habitually involves herself with violent and volatile men. First, there is Roy, Rosemary's second husband, who follows Rosemary and Jack from Florida to Utah. When Roy leaves them, Rosemary moves with Jack to Seattle, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosemary</b></font>) meets Dwight, who seems harmless until Jack moves to Chinook to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), where Dwight reveals himself to be cruel and petty. Dwight criticizes and berates Jack for real and imagined flaws, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) rants are constantly at the forefront of Jack's mind. Dwight assigns Jack chores for no reason other than to exhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) power and control over the household. Dwight also forces Jack to deliver newspapers and takes the money Jack earns for himself. The only time Dwight expresses a genuine interest in Jack is when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) teaches Jack how to fight. Dwight is excited by Jack's display of aggression, especially because it will be directed against Arthur Gayle, a notorious <div class="bookquote">``sissy''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur Gayle sissy</b></font>)</div>who has a short-lived friendship with Jack. Jack takes refuge in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) unusually vivid, imagination. Dwight's abuse and Jack's own general unhappiness in Chinook only fuel Jack's fantasies. Jack longs to escape from Chinook so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) can recreate himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) can only live the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wants for himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own mind. Jack essentially creates his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own reality, as is evidenced when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) forges ecstatic letters of praise for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) application to private boarding schools. In school, Jack tends to run with a dangerous crowd, often getting into trouble with the authorities, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) applications to private schools, Jack writes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is an A-student, star athlete, and good citizen. Jack is obsessed with the idea of himself as a virtuous and gifted young man, and has no trouble believing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that lies are the truth. Jack has many dreams of running away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) never succeeds in actualizing them. Jack's first real attempt at running away involves a plan to flee to Alaska with Arthur. Jack plans to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) getaway after a Boy Scout meeting in another town, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ends up befriending a group of boys from another troop, distancing himself from Arthur, and being conned out of all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) money. Later, Jack tries to take refuge with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) older brother, Geoffrey, at Princeton, but this plan goes awry when Jack is caught forging a bank check. Jack finally gets the opportunity to leave Chinook and start anew when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is accepted to the elite Hill School. Mr. Howard, an alumnus of Hill, interviews Jack and serves as Jack's mentor. Later, when Mr. Howard and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife have Jack fitted for a new wardrobe, Jack is warmed by their attention and affection, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) has experienced very little of at home. Before Jack leaves home for Hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and Rosemary leave Dwight after Dwight shoves Jack in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosemary</b></font>). Rosemary arranges for Jack to live temporarily with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) friend Chuck Bolger. Although Jack promises his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mother that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) will be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) best behavior while at the Bolgers', he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) promise and is caught stealing from gasoline from the nearby Welch farm. Jack feels terrible about stealing from the Welches, but cannot bring himself to apologize, which infuriates Mr. Bolger. Mr. Bolger, arranges for Jack to work at the Welch farm, but the Welches refuse Jack's help. Meanwhile, Chuck Bolger is about to be arrested for the statutory rape of a girl named Tina Flood, who is pregnant, possibly by him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). The sheriff offers to excuse Chuck if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to marries Tina, but Chuck refuses. Chuck is on the verge of being sent to jail when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chuck</b></font>) is rescued by another of the defendants, Huff, who agrees to marry Tina in his (<font color='blue'><b>Huff</b></font>) place. The summer before Jack is due to begin at Hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) goes to stay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father in California to spend some time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brother. Immediately after Jack arrives, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father leaves for Las Vegas with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) girlfriend. When Jack's father returns, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is arrested and later committed to a sanitarium, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) remains for the rest of the summer. Not surprisingly, Jack cannot make the grades that Hill demands, and is expelled midway through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) senior year. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is expelled from school, Jack joins the army and serves in the ##Vietnam War#
