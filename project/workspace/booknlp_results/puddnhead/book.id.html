Pudd`nhead Wilson is a Northerner who comes to the small Missouri town of Dawson's Landing to build a career as a lawyer. Immediately upon his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) arrival he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) alienates the townspeople, who don't understand his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) wit. They give him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) the nickname <div class="bookquote">``Pudd`nhead''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and refuse to give him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) their legal work. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) scrapes by on odd work and spends most of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) time dabbling in scientific hobbies, most notably, fingerprinting. Roxana, or Roxy, is a beautiful slave who can pass for white, though she (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) is one-sixteenth black. To save her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) infant son from ever being sold away from her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) switches him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with the child of her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) white master, who looks just like her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) son and was born on the same day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) son Chambers, now called <div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>son Chambers</b></font>)</div>grows up as a white man and heir to an estate. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) master's child, Tom, now called <div class="bookquote">``Chambers'' (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>, grows up a slave. <div class="bookquote">``Tom''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>grows into a cruel, cowardly man. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gambling debts lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), under Roxy's guidance, to rob houses, sell the now-freed Roxy as a slave, and finally to murder his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) uncle, Judge Driscoll, in a botched robbery attempt. Luigi and Angelo are former sideshow performers. Good-looking and charming, they claim to be Italian twins, heirs of a deposed nobleman. They arrive in Dawson's Landing to rent a room in Widow Cooper's house, claiming they are tired of the bustle of the world. Luigi confesses to Pudd`nhead Wilson, who has read his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) palm, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) once killed a man who tried to steal a fabulous Indian knife from the brothers. This knife is stolen by <div class="bookquote">``Tom''  (<font color='red'><b>Judge</b></font>)</div>and used to kill Judge Driscoll. Luigi gets into an argument with <div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luigi</b></font>)</div>who has him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arrested. The judge is mortified that <div class="bookquote">``Tom''  (<font color='red'><b>The judge</b></font>)</div>has compromised the family honor by doing that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) instead challenges Luigi to a duel. No one is killed, but <div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle assassin</b></font>)</div>to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own reputation, tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle that Luigi is a confessed assassin and therefore not an honorable man to duel. The twins, initially popular in the town, lose their reputation through the judge's claims against them, and lose in an election for city offices in which Pudd`nhead Wilson is elected mayor. Shortly after the election, <div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>badly in debt and needing money to pay off the man to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has fraudulently sold Roxy, murders the judge with the twins' knife while he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) is robbing him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Tom''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>escapes disguised as a woman after killing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle. The twins, out for a walk, hear the judge's cries and rush to help. They are found standing over the body and their bloody knife is on the floor. They are brought to trial for the murder. Pudd`nhead Wilson, who is their attorney, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) fingerprint collection and a few lucky accidents, discovers that <div class="bookquote">``Tom''  (<font color='red'><b>attorney accidents</b></font>)</div>is the murderer and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is not the real Tom but Chambers. The twins are redeemed and freed, but soon leave for Europe. <div class="bookquote">``Tom''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>is thrown in jail and then, since it is now known he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is a slave, sold <div class="bookquote">``down the river''  (<font color='red'><b>a slave</b></font>)</div>to pay debts from the estate of the real Tom's father. <div class="bookquote">``Chambers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>revealed to be Tom, is given back his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) place as a white man and heir, but, raised as a black man and marked by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black speech patterns, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now fits into society nowhere. Pudd`nhead is mayor of Dawson's Landing and finally a success as a lawyer, but none of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) old friends are around anymore to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) success with him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>).
