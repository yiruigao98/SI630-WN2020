Ruth came to America when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) was a young girl in a family of Polish Jewish immigrants. Ruth married Andrew Dennis McBride, a black man from North Carolina. James's childhood was spent in a chaotic household of twelve children who had neither the time nor the outlet to ponder questions of race and identity. Ruth did not want to discuss the painful details of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) early family life, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) abusive father Tateh lorded over her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) sweet-tempered and meek mother Mameh. Ruth had cut all ties with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) Jewish family. After arriving in the United States when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) was two years old, Ruth spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) early childhood traveling around the country with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) family as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) father sought employment as a rabbi. Tateh eventually gave up hope of making a living as a rabbi. He (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) settled the family in Suffolk, Virginia, and opened a store in the mostly black section of town, where he (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) overcharged his (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) customers and expressed racist opinions. When Ruth was a child, Tateh sexually abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) and made harsh demands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) to work constantly in the family store. Tateh cheated on his (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) wife, in an affair of which practically everyone in town was aware. Ruth's brother Sam left home at age fifteen, and soon after, Ruth too felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) must leave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) wanted to escape the oppressive environment of both her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) family and the South. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) was also pregnant by Peter, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) black boyfriend in Suffolk, and wanted to deal with the pregnancy away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) took trips to New York to stay with relatives, and later moved permanently to Harlem. Ruth's family disowned her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) left, disgusted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) preference for marrying a black man instead of a Jewish man, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) general failure to embrace Judaism, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) defiance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) father. Ruth promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) sister Dee-Dee that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) would return to Suffolk, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) could not reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) family's desires for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) life with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) own desires for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) promise to return for Dee-Dee, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) relationship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) sister suffered as a consequence. This separation from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) family recurs throughout the memoir as a painful element in Ruth's life. In Harlem, Ruth met Dennis, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) was immediately attracted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>), converted to Christianity, and became very involved with church activities. The couple experienced a certain degree of prejudice as a result of their interracial marriage. However, Ruth recalls these years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) life as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) happiest ones. Dennis and Ruth opened the New Brown Memorial Church together in memory of Reverend Brown, their favorite preacher. They had several children, and eventually moved to accommodate their growing family. When Ruth became pregnant with Dennis's eighth child, James, Dennis fell ill with lung cancer, and died before James was born. Ruth mourned his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) death deeply and became desperate to find a means to support herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) eight children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) relatives for assistance, but they refused to have any sort of contact with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>). Ruth met her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) second husband, Hunter Jordan, soon after. They married and eventually had four children together. James weaves his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) own life story into his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mother's story. Ruth's philosophies on race, religion, and work influence him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) greatly. Ruth always sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) children to the best schools, no matter the commute, to ensure they received the finest possible educations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) demanded respect and hard work from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) children, and always treated them tenderly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) had an unwavering faith in God and strong moral convictions. To Ruth, issues of race and identity took secondary importance to moral beliefs. James's confusion over his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) identity, along with his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) grief for the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) beloved stepfather, drove him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to a phase of drug use and crime. After spending time with working with black men in Louisville, Kentucky, where his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sister Jack lives, James became convinced of the importance of self-reliance and hard work. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) began to trust in God and to work toward self-improvement, honing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) skills in jazz music and writing. During his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) senior year of high school, James was pleasantly surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) learned he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had been admitted to Oberlin College. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) eleven siblings complete college and lead successful careers. Ruth remains close with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) children, and, later, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) grandchildren, holding holiday gatherings that remind James of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) household during childhood: chaotic, but delightfully active and stimulating.
