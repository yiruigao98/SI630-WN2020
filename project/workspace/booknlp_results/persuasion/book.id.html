We learn that the Elliots are a respected, titled, landowning family. Lady Elliot, Sir Walter's wife died fourtee n years ago and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) with three daughters: Elizabeth, Anne, and Mary. Both Elizabeth and Anne are single, but Mary, the youngest is married to a wealthy man named Charles Musgrove; they live close by. Sir Walter, who lavishly overspend s, has brought the family into great debt. When Lady Russell, a trusted family advisor, suggests that the Elliots reduce their spending, Sir Walter is horrified. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is exceedingly vain and cannot bear to imagine life without his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) usual comforts. But wi th no other option, the Elliots decide they must relocate to a house in Bath where their expenses will be more manageable. They intend to rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall. They soon find excellent tenants to rent their home; Admiral and Mrs. Croft are wealthy and well-mannered Navy people who have a model marriage. Sir Walter is relieved that the Admiral is a good-looking man. Though Sir Walter dislikes that the Navy br ings <div class="bookquote">``men of obscure birth into undue distinction,''  (<font color='red'><b>Navy</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is satisfied with Admiral and Mrs. Croft as tenants for his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) home. Anne Elliot, the middle daughter, is also excited to meet the Crofts; Mrs. Croft is the sister of the man Anne loves. Eight years ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was engaged to be married to Captain Frederick Wentworth, but Lady Russell persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) that Captain Wentworth was not of high enough consequence, and Anne called off the engagement. With the Crofts at Kellynch, Anne hopes to see Captain Wentwor th again. Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Mrs. Clay -LRB-a widowed, somewhat lower-class friend of the family-RRB- leave for Bath. Anne goes to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister Mary at Uppercross Cottage for a period of two months. Mary complains often and Anne patiently listens to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister's worries. At Uppercross, Anne finds the Musgrove family absolutely delightful. Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove have three grown children: Charles -LRB-Mary's husband-RRB-, Henrietta, and Louisa. Anne marvels at the bustling nature of the household and the Musgroves' clear affection for their children. Soon news comes that Captain Wentworth has returned from sea and is staying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sister at Kellynch. Captain Wentworth makes friends with Mr. Musgrove, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) becomes a daily visitor at Uppercross. A nne is at first anxious to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) again after such a long time, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) actions toward her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) are merely detached and polite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) seems more smitten with Henrietta and Louisa Musgrove. Anne resigns herself to the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has lost Captain Wentworth's lo ve forever. Captain Wentworth proposes that they all take a trip to Lyme to go visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) friends the Harvilles. While they are there, a good-looking gentleman takes notice of Anne; they later discover that this man is Mr. Elliot, Anne's cousin and Sir Walter' s heir to Kellynch. The group decides to go for a morning walk on the beach. Louisa Musgrove has a bad fall and is knocked unconscious. Anne keeps a level head and does all she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) can to care for Louisa. The doctor determines that Louisa will recover, but sh e will have to remain in Lyme for several months. Captain Wentworth blames himself for Louisa's fall and tries to help the Musgrove family. Anne returns to Uppercross to help Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove care for their younger children. After a few weeks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) le aves to stay with Lady Russell. After Christmas, Lady Russell and Anne decide that they must rejoin the rest of the Elliot family in Bath, much to Anne's dismay. Sir Walter and Elizabeth care little about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), but they are glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) come to Bath. In Bath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is formally introduc ed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cousin Mr. Elliot, who has made peace with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) once estranged uncle, Sir Walter. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) questions Mr. Elliot's motives for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) sudden apology, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) accepts him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as a pleasing gentleman. Mr. Elliot is extraordinarily appreciative of Anne, and i t is soon apparent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) seeks to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wife. While in Bath, Anne becomes reacquainted with an old school friend, Mrs. Smith, who has recently been widowed and fallen on hard times. From Mrs. Smith, Anne learns about Mr. Elliot's hidden past; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) finds out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has mistreated Mrs. Smith and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) plans to marry Anne to ensure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) becomes the sole heir of the Kellynch baronetcy. Mr. Elliot fears that Sir Walter will marry Mrs. Clay, have a son, and thereby deprive him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) title. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) plots to ensure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) will remain Sir Walter's heir. Anne is appalled to hear this news. The Crofts arrive in Bath with news of two engagements; Henrietta will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin Charles Hayter, and Louisa will marry Captain Benwick, a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) met at Lyme while she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was convalescing. Anne is overjoyed that Captain Wentworth is not promis ed to Louisa and is free once again. Captain Wentworth soon arrives in Bath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) is now a much richer man than he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was eight years ago and Sir Walter reluctantly admits him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) into their social circle. Wentworth grows jealous because he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) believes Anne is attach ed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cousin Mr. Elliot. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) writes Anne a love letter in which is pours describes his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) true, constant, and undying love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Anne is thrilled and they become engaged. Mr. Elliot is shocked that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) plan to marry Anne has been foiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) and Mrs . Clay leave Bath; it is rumored that they are together. There is no longer any danger that Sir Walter will marry beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) station. Sir Walter and Lady Russell give their approval for the marriage between Anne and Captain Wentworth.
