Annie John lives with her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother and father in a city on the island of Antigua. During her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tenth year, Annie becomes obsessed with the idea of death after spending the summer outside the city near a cemetery and learning that children die. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) returns to the city, Annie starts stopping by funeral parlors just to watch mourners. One day, a young hunchbacked girl her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) age dies. Annie rushes from school to attend the girl's wake where she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) gets to view the dead girl's body. Later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) realizes that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) excitement she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) forgot to bring the fish home for dinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) makes up a small lie, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother knows the truth. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) punishment, Annie is forced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) dinner outside under the breadfruit tree. Generally during summer vacation, Annie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother spend all their time together. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother lets Annie sleep in and then adds some hot water to the bath for her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). Sometimes they even take a bath together after her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother adds herbs and spices that the obeah woman, a local healer, recommends. After the bath, they usually go to town where her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother teaches Annie how to shop and get the best products for the best prices. Annie thinks that her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother is very beautiful and very wise. Mrs. John grew up in Dominica but came to Antigua when she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was sixteen following a conflict with her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) parents. Annie's father had children by other women too, and sometimes these women curse Mrs. John on the street. One day, Annie returns home and finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) parents making love in bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) feels rejected when seeing them because she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) is not part of their union. In particular, she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) feels angry at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother's neglect of their special relationship and starts to view her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) coldly. When Annie starts school, she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) becomes best friends with Gwen. Annie is the brightest student in the class whose essay on the first day of school is praised. Although liked by the teachers, Annie also is popular with the students since she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) stands up for everyone, is good at sports, and makes rambunctious jokes when in private. Annie and Gwen walk to and from school together everyday. Annie tries to use their relationship to assuage her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) grief at being neglected by her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother, but it does not entirely work. Annie eventually befriends the Red Girl, a tomboyish girl from a lower class who runs around dirty and disheveled. Annie admires her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) unstructured, carefree life and Annie starts to mimic her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) by playing marbles. Annie also begins a pattern of petty thievery to buy the Red Girl presents and lies daily so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) can meet up with the Red Girl after school. One day Annie's mother catches her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) coming out from under the house, where Annie hides her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) stolen loot. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) with a marble and searches everywhere to find Annie's stash. Annie denies that she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) has any other marbles despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother's entreaties and takes pleasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother's inability to find them. Eventually, Annie starts to menstruate and the Red Girl moves away, so Annie stops playing marbles altogether. Annie's good grades make her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) the prefect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) class, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) occasionally mischievous behavior. One day during a history lesson, Annie grows bored because she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) knows the material and starts reading ahead in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) finds out that Christopher Columbus was imprisoned later in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) life for having offended the Queen. Annie sees a picture of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) in chains and writes under it, <div class="bookquote">``The Great Man Can No Longer Move,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>a phrase that her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) father once used to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) grandfather. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) teacher, Miss Edward, sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) and upbraids her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) for blasphemous behavior. Annie is sent to the principal who takes the prefect position away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) and orders her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) to copy Book I and Book II of Milton's Paradise Lost. After her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) scolding, Annie returns home hoping that her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother will cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) up, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) father and mother seem too absorbed in each other to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) distress. Furthermore, her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother tricks her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) into eating breadfruit, something Annie detests, by making it look like rice. When faced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother's betrayal, Annie feels complete hatred for her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). Annie's unhappiness comes to resemble a heavy black ball inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) that is covered with cobwebs. Annie cannot easily say what caused this ball but it makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) feel miserable all the time. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) success continues at school and she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) is promoted into a class with much older girls. Annie feels socially isolated and even finds Gwen to be a dull companion. Annie dreams of moving to Belgium, a place that Jane Eyre visited, so that Annie's mother can no longer find her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>). One day after school, Annie avoids Gwen and heads into town instead. Annie stares at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) reflection in a store window and feel overcome by sadness at seeing herself look so ugly and ragged. A group of boys nearby starts teasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) speaks to one of them since she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) as a child. When they keep laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) goes home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother confronts her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in the yard and tells Annie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) saw Annie's flirtatious behavior in town. After her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother calls Annie a slut, Annie loses her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) temper and says, <div class="bookquote">``like mother, like daughter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie/Annie John</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother then says that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) best until that moment. Annie senses that something dark has come between them. At dinner that night, Annie tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) father she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) own trunk like the one that her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother has. Annie suffers a mental breakdown that coincides with a three-month rainstorm and becomes bedridden. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) sickness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) behavior reverts to that of an infant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) cannot be left alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) wets her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) bed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) needs help eating. Both the local doctor and an obeah woman treat her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remains ill. Eventually, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grandmother, Ma Chess, comes. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heals Annie not with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) powerful knowledge of obeah, but from holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) throughout the days. After Annie is better, they notice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) has grown even taller than she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) has to get a new set of clothing before returning to school. Finally, Annie turns seventeen and decides to leave Antigua to study nursing in England. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) looks forward to living a separate life and being away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) mother. As she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) walks to the boat with them, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) young life with its warmth, but acknowledges that there is no space left for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) parents' house. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) parents wave goodbye as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) disappears on the boat and Annie lies in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) cabin with expectations of the future.
