It is thundering, foreboding rain. Philip Marlowe, a tough, cynical, yet honest private detective, is hired by the old, ailing General Sternwood to help him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``take care of''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Arthur Gwynn Geiger, a homosexual -LRB-possibly bisexual-RRB- pornographer who has been blackmailing the General with potentially scandalous pictures of the General's daughter, Carmen Sternwood. Marlowe agrees to the task. Marlowe's first assignment becomes complicated by and intertwined with a second plot, which also has its roots in the initial meeting with Sternwood. General Sternwood mentions, peripherally yet implicitly, the disappearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) well- liked, ex-bootlegger son-in-law, Rusty Regan. Rusty had been married to the General's eldest daughter, Vivian Sternwood. Marlowe's first action is to stake out Geiger's shop, which turns out to be a pornography racket disguised as a rare bookshop. After pinpointing Geiger, Marlowe follows the man to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) house and hides in wait outside. The night is rainy and Marlowe sees that Carmen Sternwood has gone inside Geiger's house. There is suddenly a flash and a scream, which turns out to be the flash of a camera and Carmen's reaction to the flash. When Marlowe approaches Geiger's house to see what is happening, three gunshots ring out inside the house, followed by the rapid footsteps of the escaping gunman. Entering Geiger's home, Marlowe sees that Carmen is drugged and naked, sitting on a chair. Geiger, who had been taking pictures of Carmen, is dead at her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) feet. The plateholder of the camera--which ostensibly contains the pictures Geiger had taken of Carmen--is missing. Carmen seems unaffected by what has transpired, and is in fact giggly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) is so high on ether. Later, Owen Taylor, the Sternwoods' chauffeur, is found dead in the Pacific Ocean, near the fishing pier in Lido. It is unclear whether Taylor's death is a murder or suicide. As the plot unfolds, Marlow begins to figure out that Taylor was in love with Carmen Sternwood, and that it was Taylor who killed Geiger in retaliation for the naughty pictures of Carmen that Geiger had taken. Owen Taylor's death is not the only death linked to Geiger. Another character, Joe Brody, appears and is eventually murdered. Brody and Agnes Lozelle, an employee of Geiger, have been plotting a takeover of Geiger's smut racket. Brody is also in possession of the negatives and prints of the scandalous pictures of Carmen Sternwood--pictures he (<font color='blue'><b>Geiger</b></font>) uses to bribe Carmen's sister, Vivian, for money. Later, when Marlowe tries to retrieve information from Brody as well as the pictures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) client's daughter, Brody is murdered by Carol Lundgren. Carol Lundgren, Geiger's homosexual lover, kills Brody because he (<font color='blue'><b>Geiger</b></font>) thinks Brody killed Geiger. Lundgren is imprisoned for the murder. Agnes is released from custody. The pictures are returned to Marlowe, who takes care that they do not fall into the wrong hands again. Ultimately, the newspapers release the story of the blackmail, but in a form that is nothing like the true story. Marlowe's job is technically over, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) has taken care of Geiger and the blackmailing. However, Marlowe, still curious about Rusty Regan's whereabouts, does not see himself as finished. Marlowe thinks that perhaps the General believed Regan was somehow involved in the blackmailing plot and that the General wanted to confirm whether or not this is true. The second plot, that of Regan, begins to unfold as the other--that of the blackmailing--is seemingly brought to a close. Meanwhile, Marlowe realizes he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) is being followed by a man in a gray Plymouth sedan. The man, who turns out to be Harry Jones, has information about where Mona Grant, Eddie Mars's wife, is being kept in a hideout. Because rumors abound that Regan has run away with Mona, Marlowe considers it significant to find out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mona</b></font>) whereabouts. Marlowe finds that Mona had not actually run away with Regan; instead, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mona</b></font>) husband, Eddie Mars, has kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Mona</b></font>) in hiding for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mars</b></font>) own protection, to keep everyone thinking that Regan is alive and has run off with Mona. Harry Jones, who has paired up with Agnes Lozelle, offers this information to Marlowe, but Jones is murdered the process by Lash Canino, Eddie Mars's vicious gunman. Once Marlowe knows where Mona is he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) ventures out to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Mona</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) arrives at the hiding place, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) is beaten by Canino and handcuffed. Marlowe shares a scene with Mona, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) nicknames Silver-Wig because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mona</b></font>) platinum wig disguise. Marlowe is attracted to Mona. They have a moment together and they kiss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mona</b></font>) seems to be a good person, but Marlowe cannot manage to sway her (<font color='blue'><b>Mona</b></font>) away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mona</b></font>) loyalty to Eddie Mars. Nevertheless, Mona helps Marlowe escape from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) ropes and, later, helps him (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) kill Canino. Everything comes to an end when Marlowe returns Carmen Sternwood's gun--the gun Carmen had used to try to persuade Brody to return her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) pictures to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>)--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>), and Carmen asks Marlow to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) to shoot. Down in the abandoned Sternwood family oil field, Carmen turns her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) gun on Marlowe in an attempt to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>). Marlowe, however, foreseeing this turn of events, has loaded the gun with blanks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) figures out, in the end, that Carmen killed Regan and that Vivian paid Eddie Mars's man, Canino, to hide the body. Regan has thus been dead throughout the entire novel, lying at the bottom of an oil sump on the Sternwood fields. Marlowe solves the puzzle, allowing Vivian to go free as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) gets Carmen the help she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) needs to alleviate her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) insanity. Eddie Mars never receives just retribution. Marlowe and Vivian promise not to tell the General about Regan because it would break his (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) heart. The novel ends with Marlowe's thoughts about death--<div class="bookquote">``the big sleep'' (<font color='red'><b>Marlowe</b></font>)</div>--as an escape, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) thoughts of Silver- wig.
